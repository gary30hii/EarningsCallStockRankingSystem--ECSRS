I need to remind everyone that today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jessica Kourakos, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Kourakos, please go ahead.\nJessica Kourakos: Thanks, Amy. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2020 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; Patrick Goris, our CFO; and Steve Etzel, our CFO elect. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include, and our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today\u2019s call. In addition, we\u2019ve filed an 8-K and have posted supplemental information on our website related to our new business segments and adjusted earnings definition. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. So with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Blake.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Before we begin discussing our results and outlook, I\u2019d like to make a few opening remarks. I first want to address Patrick\u2019s recent announcement that he will be leaving Rockwell to start a new chapter in his career. In his 14 years with us, the company has continued its long legacy of financial discipline and delivering superior shareowner returns, and we wish him well in his next pursuit. Many of you know Steve Etzel, who will be stepping in as CFO on an interim basis. Steve has been with us for over 30 years and over these years has run investor relations, treasury, and corporate FP&A. The Board and I have full confidence he will reinforce our strong financial framework and continued commitment to superior shareowner returns. Patrick and Steve are ensuring a very smooth transition, while we consider internal and external candidates for a permanent successor. I also want to send my deepest thanks to the thousands of employees who have been working under very difficult conditions, including the temporary pay cuts we implemented in May, to help us preserve jobs and to serve our customers during the pandemic. These cost actions enabled us to protect our company\u2019s financial strength and allowed us to continue making important targeted investments to drive our future growth. Now, with business conditions gradually improving, we will reverse the temporary pay reductions by the end of November, one month earlier than expected. In addition, our guidance for next year assumes a return to a fully funded bonus plan. Because of our employees\u2019 hard work and dedication, we have never been so well positioned for what lies ahead. This is another testament to the type of culture we have at Rockwell and I couldn\u2019t be prouder. Turning now to our Q4 results on Slide 3. While business conditions remain difficult relative to a year ago, we are pleased with the steady improvement we\u2019re seeing. In Q4, total reported sales declined by 9% versus the prior year. Organic sales were down about 12% versus prior year, but grew 10% sequentially. Product sales outperformed our expectations and were driven by better-than-expected results in Drives and Motion. Motion performance was led by our Independent Cart Technology, where we received the largest single order in Rockwell Automation\u2019s history. We won this multi-year project from the U.S. Navy based on a need for precise, highly responsive motion control not available with traditional systems, and on Rockwell\u2019s long track record as a dependable U.S. supplier. Independent Cart provides a new way for us to add value and drive growth. You\u2019ll be hearing more about it, and other innovative technologies, at our upcoming Investor Day on November 17. Turning to Information Solutions and Connected Services. Organic sales were up low-single digits versus prior year. IS/CS orders grew double digits over the prior year in both software and connected services. IS/CS sales reached approximately $400 million in fiscal 2020 on an organic basis and were well in excess of that when including all of our recent inorganic investments. Demand for software sold as a result of our PTC partnership is also increasing rapidly as we enter the new fiscal year, and we\u2019re very happy with the recent extension and expansion of this relationship. Together with PTC, we added over 200 new customer logos in fiscal 2020, and deal sizes in our Information Solutions software business continue to grow. The synergies of our combined offering are very evident to customers. In Connected Services, our recent Kalypso acquisition is doing particularly well and is helping us further differentiate. Kalypso is already contributing to some large competitive wins, and they just had the best orders quarter in their history. Total sales include a three point positive contribution from inorganic investments, led by our Sensia joint venture, along with the Kalypso and ASEM acquisitions. Total backlog in the quarter grew double digits versus the prior year and grew high-single digits on an organic basis. Our Q4 Solutions and Services book-to-bill was 0.87 and full-year book-to-bill was over 1. This Solutions and Services book-to-bill does not include the large Independent Cart order we received from the U.S. Navy. Turning to profitability, strong segment operating margin performance of over 20% in the quarter was flat with last year on lower sales, underscoring our increasing business resilience. Free cash flow was also very strong, reinforcing our solid balance sheet and liquidity position. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 4, where I will provide a few highlights of our Q4 organic end-market performance. Our discrete market segment declined approximately 10%, with automotive performing better than we expected, driven by stronger MRO and projects sales. Among the more notable projects in the quarter was a significant OT cybersecurity win in Europe with one of the major German car companies. And in electric vehicles, we saw momentum continue in the industry with battery manufacturers and brand owners. We are excited by recent announcements from both new and established automakers as they focus on production of compelling new EV offerings. In semiconductor, we had another very strong quarter and grew high-single digits versus the prior year. This vertical is benefiting from a variety of secular tailwinds such as the rise of smart devices and the resulting internet of things, along with the need for faster data centers and the adoption of 5G wireless technology. In addition to facilities management, which has been a strong foundation for us, we see an opportunity for our material handling technology as well as our software. In e-commerce, we had a significant expansion win at Cloostermans, one of the largest and most important suppliers to the global ecommerce industry. This is another industry with long-term secular tailwinds that will continue to invest in automation and industrial software to support its tremendous future growth. Turning now to our hybrid market segment. This segment declined a little less than 5% and outperformed the discrete and process industry segments. Food and beverage and life sciences each declined low-single digits for both the quarter and for the year. Packaging OEMs had another strong quarter and delivered double-digit growth versus the prior year. We believe these markets will outperform in fiscal 2021. Eco-industrial outperformed other industries in the quarter, driven by growth in water, where we continue to benefit from a differentiated offering that integrates control, power, and industrial software. Tire and rubber was down double digits but performed in line with our expectations. In the quarter, we had key wins at important strategic accounts, including Cooper Tire, which continues to strengthen its global track and trace capabilities to support the company\u2019s long-term growth plans. They chose FactoryTalk software because of our strong MES and analytics capabilities, and our differentiated ability to connect to both Rockwell and non-Rockwell control platforms. Once again, our strong software portfolio, our ecosystem of best-of-breed partners, and our expertise in connecting diverse manufacturing environments were all important reasons Rockwell won this very competitive project with Cooper Tire. Process markets were down approximately 20%. Oil and gas was a little weaker than we expected, but that was partially offset by better-than-expected performance in most other process markets like mining and pulp and paper. Sensia held up fairly well during the quarter and continues to demonstrate their competitive differentiation. Turning now to Slide 5 and our organic regional sales performance in the quarter. North America organic sales declined by 12% versus the prior year. Business conditions improved through the quarter, particularly in products, where orders significantly exceeded our expectations. While our large Independent Cart win was part of that result, we also saw great software orders within Information Solutions that more than doubled versus the prior year, creating strong momentum entering the new fiscal year. In EMEA, sales declined 12% largely due to CapEx delays. These were partially offset by strong growth in water. We also saw growth in life sciences and PPE-related machine builder business. Sales in the Asia Pacific region declined 9% largely due to declines in end user business within automotive and mass transit. Double-digit growth in mining and life sciences partially offset those declines. China sales declined, but orders grew mid-single digits year-over-year in the quarter. Latin America declines were led by mining and oil and gas. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 6 to review highlights for the full year. It\u2019s an understatement to say that fiscal 2020 turned out very different than the plans we discussed together at a great Investor Day during an incredible Automation Fair in Chicago last November. The shadow of the pandemic soon created unique challenges, but I\u2019m proud of our ability to respond while taking big steps forward in the execution of our strategic vision. We kept the safety of our employees at the top of our list and continued to provide dedicated service to our customers, many of whom are producing the food, water, protective gear, and medicine that keep us going. The pandemic has focused us all on what\u2019s truly important. We took thoughtful actions to manage costs through this pandemic while at the same time protect strategic investments, including some very big internal development projects. And you can see those investments drive the performance of our software business, which reached over $500 million in revenue in fiscal 2020 and was one of the best performing areas of our business in both orders and sales this year. We deployed over $500 million for inorganic investments that contributed almost four points to our top line growth; and we deployed over $700 million in cash toward dividends and repurchases enabled by our strong free cash flow. I am tremendously proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished in fiscal 2020, and I\u2019m excited about the resulting momentum as we enter fiscal 2021. Turning now to our outlook on Slide 7. As I said earlier, we saw strong sequential momentum exiting the year. Industrial production is projected to grow in the second half of our fiscal year. So it may take a couple of quarters for us to climb back to year-over-year sales growth from the Q3 trough in fiscal 2020. We expect double-digit year-over-year growth during our third and fourth quarters. Of course, we are all closely monitoring global infection levels related to this pandemic, but we are not assuming a widespread shutdown of customer manufacturing operations. We expect reported sales to grow about 7.5% at the midpoint of the guidance range, including 5% of organic growth and over a point of growth from our fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 acquisitions to date. In addition, we are adopting annual recurring revenue as an important metric for the company and have added ARR as a performance metric in our incentive compensation framework beginning this year. ARR is expected to grow double digits in fiscal 2021, after showing over 6% growth in fiscal 2020. This is further evidence of our ability to build an even more resilient business model. Adjusted EPS is expected to reach $8.65 at the midpoint, which is up 10% from last year\u2019s fiscal 2020 results. We are targeting free cash flow conversion of 100%. A more detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 8. I won\u2019t go into the details on this slide, but as you can see, we expect positive organic sales growth in all of our key end markets next year with the exception of oil and gas. With that, let me now turn it over to Patrick who will elaborate on our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 financial performance. We\u2019ll then have Steve discuss our fiscal 2021 outlook in his remarks. Patrick?\nPatrick Goris: Thank you, Blake, and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll start on Slide 9, Fourth Quarter Key Financial Information. Sales, segment margin, Adjusted EPS and free cash flow were all better than expected in the fourth quarter, mainly as a result of better organic sales growth and productivity. Organic sales improved as the quarter progressed and were up 10% sequentially versus Q3. Compared to last year, Q4 organic sales were down 12% and acquisitions contributed just over 3% to total growth. Currency translation was a smaller headwind than expected and decreased sales by 0.3 points. Overall company backlog increased year-over-year in the quarter. Backlog for our short-cycle products was up double digits from a year-over-year and sequential perspective, even excluding the very large Independent Cart order Blake referred to earlier. Segment operating margin was 20.2%, the same as last year. The negative impact of lower sales was partially offset by a combination of temporary and structural cost actions. Fourth quarter results included about $10 million of restructuring charges which are expected to yield over $15 million in additional annualized structural cost savings, most of these savings will be realized in fiscal 2021. General corporate net expense was $22 million, pretty much in line with what we expected. As I mentioned earlier, adjusted EPS of $1.87 was better than expected, mainly as a result of better organic sales, productivity, and a slightly lower tax rate. I\u2019ll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 15%, a bit lower than we expected, due to a slightly different geographic mix of our pre-tax income. Free cash flow performance remained strong. We generated over $300 million of free cash flow in the quarter, well over 100% conversion on adjusted income. Note that this result includes a voluntary $50 million pre-tax contribution made to the U.S. pension plan. This voluntary pension contribution was not reflected in our prior guidance. Slide 10 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our operating segments. Organic sales of both segments improved significantly compared to last quarter. Both segments were up about 10% on an organic basis compared to Q3, though organic sales remained lower compared to last year. Segment margin of both segments increased over 300 basis points compared to Q3, mainly due to higher organic sales, but also as a result of cost control including a full quarter benefit of our cost reduction actions and generally improving operating efficiencies. Compared to last year, Architecture & Software margins were up 100 basis points, despite the impact of lower sales, mainly as a result of our cost actions, including lower incentive compensation. Segment margins for the Control Products & Solutions segment declined 60 basis points compared to last year, with cost actions offsetting most of the impact of lower organic sales. The next Slide 11, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q4 fiscal 2019 to Q4 fiscal 2020. As you can see, core performance was down about $0.15 on a 12% organic sales decline. This implies core earnings conversion, that is, excluding the effects of acquisitions and currency of a little below 20%, which is a bit better than the outlook I shared with you in July. A positive adjusted EPS contribution from acquisitions is offset by unfavorable currency impacts. Slide 12 provides key financial information for full year fiscal 2020. After a good start to the fiscal year, we experienced significant year-over-year sales declines in the second half as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Organic sales declined 8% for the fiscal year. Our cost reduction actions protected key investments and helped to partially mitigate the impact of lower sales. We selectively increased investments in some of our highest priority areas. R&D expense was about flat compared to fiscal 2019, and R&D as a percent of sales increased further to 5.9% of sales in fiscal 2020. Full year segment margin remained at about 20% compared to record 22% segment margins last year, and Adjusted EPS was down 11%. Free cash flow performance remained strong, and excluding the $50 million voluntary pension contribution in fiscal 2020, was flat compared to last year. Free cash flow conversion was over 110% of adjusted income. And finally, return on invested capital remained well above our target of over 20%. Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to mention that we deployed about $1.3 billion of capital towards acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases in fiscal 2020. Our capital structure and liquidity remain very strong. At September 30, our fiscal year end, cash on the balance sheet was over $700 million, and our total debt was about $2 billion. During the fourth quarter, we paid off the $400 million term loan that we executed earlier in the year, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at September 30 was 1.0. With that, Steve.\nSteve Etzel: Thank you, Patrick. Moving to Slide 13 product order trends, this slide shows our daily order trends for our products, which account for about two-thirds of our overall sales and represent our shorter-cycle businesses. As we expected, order intake for products continued to improve during the quarter. Our guidance for fiscal 2021 assumes this trend will continue. Daily product order performance through October continued to improve on a year-over-year basis, down low-single digits. Solutions orders are recovering slower than product orders. Let\u2019s move on to the next Slide 14, guidance for fiscal 2021. As Blake mentioned, we are expecting sales of about $6.8 billion in fiscal 2021, up about 7.5% at the midpoint of the range. We expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 3.5% to 6.5% and about 5% at the mid-point of our range. From a calendarization viewpoint, we expect first half organic sales to be down compared to fiscal 2020, followed by a stronger second half with organic sales up mid-to-high teens. As a reminder, first half fiscal 2020 organic sales were about flat, followed by double-digit declines in the second half. We therefore expect easier comps starting in Q3 of fiscal 2021. We expect segment operating margin to be between 20% and 20.5% probably at the higher end of that range. At the midpoint, our guidance assumes full year core earnings conversion, which excludes the impacts of currency and acquisitions of between 30% and 35%. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect to offset a $150 million year-over-year headwind related to fully funding our incentive compensation and reversing fiscal 2020 temporary cost reduction actions with additional productivity. We expect the full-year adjusted effective tax rate will be about 14%. This includes a 300-basis point benefit related to discrete items which we expect to realize late in the fiscal year. Our underlying adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be 17% to 18%. As disclosed in our earnings release, we are modifying our definition of adjusted EPS beginning in fiscal 2021. Under the new definition, we are now also excluding purchase accounting depreciation and amortization expense from adjusted EPS. This has the effect of increasing adjusted EPS by approximately $0.20 on a full year basis. Please note that we filed an 8-K this morning that provides historical information reflecting the new definition of adjusted EPS, as well as recast historical information for our new operating segments that we announced previously. Our adjusted EPS guidance range on the new basis is $8.45 to $8.85. This compares to fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS of $7.87 on the new basis. On an apples-to-apples basis, at the midpoint of the range, this represents 10% adjusted EPS growth on about 5% higher organic sales. We expect adjusted EPS to improve throughout the year and anticipate first quarter fiscal 2021 adjusted EPS to be lower than our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter performance, primarily as a result of a $0.30 sequential headwind related to increased incentive compensation expense and the reversal of our temporary cost actions as of the end of November. Finally, we expect full-year 2021 free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. This assumes $150 million of capital expenditures and a $50 million voluntary pre-tax U.S. pension contribution. A few additional comments on fiscal 2021 guidance, corporate and other expense, which we previously referred to as general corporate net expense, is expected to be around $105 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2021 is expected to be between $90 million and $95 million, a little lower than fiscal 2020. Finally, we\u2019re assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 117 million shares. The next Slide 15 provides the adjusted EPS walk from fiscal 2020 to the fiscal 2021 guidance midpoint. Moving from left to right, fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS was $7.68 on the old definition. Next you see the $0.19 impact of the new definition of adjusted EPS. So, fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS on the new basis was $7.87. Core performance is expected to contribute about $1.90. This includes the benefit of higher organic sales, as well as the benefit of our cost reduction actions. Reinstatement of the bonus and reversal of the temporary cost actions, together, will be a headwind of about $1.15. As mentioned in last quarter, we expect these headwinds to be offset by productivity, which is in core. Currency forecasts project a weaker U.S. dollar compared to fiscal 2020, which should contribute about $0.10 to EPS. The higher tax rate is expected to be about a $0.15 headwind. Acquisitions made during fiscal 2020, and so far this year, are expected to add about $0.10. Note that Sensia is now in core, as October 1 was the one-year anniversary of the formation of the joint venture. As mentioned, at the midpoint of our guidance range, adjusted EPS is $8.65. Moving on to the next Slide 16, I\u2019ll make a few comments on our capital deployment framework. You may recognize this slide from our last Investor Day. Our capital deployment priorities remain the same. Our first priority is organic growth. After that, we focus capital deployment on inorganic activities. Then we focus on capital returns to shareowners, through our dividend and then repurchases. Our capital deployment plans for fiscal 2021 include dividends of about $500 million. As a reminder, we announced a 5% dividend increase last week. Consistent with our past track record, we expect our remaining capital deployment to include a balance of inorganic investments and share repurchases. We resumed share repurchases on October 1, the beginning of our fiscal year. In summary, our guidance assumes a continued sequential improvement in organic sales performance. Cost actions are expected to offset the significant headwind of reinstating incentive compensation and reversing temporary cost actions and we expect about 10% adjusted EPS growth and continued strong free cash flow conversion. Turning to Slide, 17, I\u2019ll finish with a comment about our new segment structure which is effective for fiscal 2021. As a reminder, our first quarter fiscal 2021 results will be reported in the new, three-segment format as shown here. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Steve. We continue to see our customers take steps to increase their resilience, agility, and sustainability. Resilience includes investments to reduce single points of failure, with a growing list of companies announcing plans to build or expand North American operations. Our strong market share in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada make us a natural beneficiary of these plans. Other measures to increase resilience include increased automation, traceability, and remote monitoring, which are all Rockwell strengths. We\u2019re making investments in our own operations, which we\u2019ll showcase during next week\u2019s Investor Day. Our contribution to operations agility is demonstrated by our great results in consumer and life sciences packaging equipment and the growth of our software to manage the increasingly dynamic SKU\u2019s offered by our customers. The pandemic has prompted new food and beverage packaging formats, along with quantities of testing kits, therapeutic drugs, and hopefully very soon, doses of vaccines. Quite simply, these cannot be manufactured at the necessary scale, safety, and quality without automation. We\u2019re proud of the role our innovation is playing at Pfizer, Roche, and many other companies as we help the world recover. The need to increase the sustainability of industrial processes is only increasing. Clean drinking water is one of the reasons our Eco Industrial focus is so important for the future, along with electric vehicles and the everyday ways our products reduce energy consumption in every industry. This expanded value gives us optimism for the coming years. In fiscal 2021 we are guiding to high single-digit reported growth, paced by our highest-margin segment. This results in guidance that also includes double-digit EPS growth. I\u2019m looking forward to telling you more about our plans next week, with the help of great customers, partners, and a very talented Rockwell leadership team. With that, let me pass the baton back to Jessica to begin the Q&A session.\nJessica Kourakos: Thanks, Blake. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Amy. Let\u2019s take our first question.\nOperator: Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott, your line is open.\nScott Davis: Hey, good morning guys.\nBlake Moret: Good morning.\nScott Davis: And congrats, Patrick. Good luck. You\u2019ll be missed, I\u2019m sure.\nPatrick Goris: Thank you, Scott. This contract with the Navy is interesting. I mean, I haven\u2019t heard you talk about Independent Cart in a while. What is the U.S. Navy doing with the technology?\nBlake Moret: Scott, we can\u2019t talk in specifics about the particular application, but I can tell you that Independent Cart in general allows for more precise motion control than some of the traditional methods of servo amps and other types of technology. So with the kind of acceleration and deceleration profiles that are needed for some of these high performance applications, Independent Cart was really a differentiated solution. It also has to operate and as you can imagine, very difficult environments. The vital point is that, while we don\u2019t talk as much about our government business, now Rockwell\u2019s been a trusted U.S. supplier to the government for a long time, and so some of these premium high-performance applications were a natural fit.\nScott Davis: Okay, makes sense. And then you mentioned Blake, PTC helping you add 200 new customer logos. What \u2013 I know that it might be a little bit varied, but any general theme around what type of new customers you\u2019re able to bring in, any particular end markets, geographies, that type of thing that you could point to?\nBlake Moret: Scott, one of the things that we\u2019ve really been proud of our partnership with PTC is good diversity of customers and geographies that we\u2019ve been able penetrate with the combined offering. So, while food and beverage and consumer-facing industries, as they are large for Rockwell\u2019s overall business are the source of a lot of the applications. It goes across automotive and mining as well as many of the other industries that we talk about all the time. It gives us new ways to win in these, and some of the things that we\u2019re most excited about that we\u2019ve talked about before are that it\u2019s not just on top of Rockwell control systems, about half of these applications are going on top of competitive control systems. So it\u2019s a new way to add value and to be meaningful in those customers\u2019 digital transformations. It\u2019s really across the various industries and across the geographies. We have wins in every geography we serve.\nScott Davis: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks, and good luck, guys.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett. John, your line is open.\nJohn Inch: Thank you very much. Good morning, everybody, and congratulations, Patrick.\nPatrick Goris: Good morning, John. Thank you.\nJohn Inch: Welcome. Do you guys expect the cadence of the 10% core sequential sales to be sustained throughout the year? I realized that in aware of your mid-single digit core year-over-year, but talk to me about just sort of the sequential cadence, and do you expect that to sustain itself or if not even perhaps accelerate over the balance of fiscal 2021 as part of your guide?\nSteve Etzel: Hi, John, this is Steve. We expect a gradual sequential recovery throughout the year, including into the first quarter. And as we said on the call, that implies a first half decline year-over-year, and then a second half year-over-year growth rate in mid- to high-teens.\nBlake Moret: Yes. What I would also add John is that we did see good orders in October in terms of improvement. So, particularly on the products, that was an encouraging sign as we entered the year. We have to say that services and solutions order recovery is lagging behind those product orders, but products are really the leading indicator that we look at.\nJohn Inch: Right. Right. I understand that year-over-year. But does that translate into, like, how does that translate in terms of your expectations in terms of sequential improvement? Like we did 10% this quarter, do you expect that to slow in the December and March quarters and then pick back up? Just a little bit more color on how you think about the sequential trend.\nSteve Etzel: Yes. John, I think it\u2019s best to think of it as a mid-single digit quarter-to-quarter sequential growth in fiscal 2021.\nJohn Inch: Okay, good. No, that\u2019s helpful. And then just as a follow-up on your Page 15 on your EPS walk, where did the structural actions fall? I think you said in core, I just want to confirm that there\u2019s no structural actions that are sort of offsetting the temporary return, like you\u2019ve split it. And maybe I remember, Patrick, last quarter, you talked about you\u2019re going to take out some redundant facilities, maybe some sales offices and stuff. Is there a way to quantify the carryover of this structural impact in EPS? So I see the $15 headwind. What does that map against in terms of this structural takeout that is in response to the pandemic, right? Like would have been sort of\u2026\nSteve Etzel: Sure. John, the $15 headwind that you see there on the walk is the bonus rehearsal, I\u2019m sorry, the bonus reinstatement and the temporary cost reversal. That bonus is about $115 million in and of itself for the full year. I will point out by the way as it relates to the bonus; it\u2019s obviously a full year headwind. The biggest headwind we\u2019ll see on a year-over-year bonus is in the second, I\u2019m sorry, yes, the second quarter, but each quarter will have some headwinds. In terms of some of the structural savings and so on, on that bridge, that\u2019s all in core. We have about $60 million of structural savings, which relate to restructurings that we\u2019ve taken over the last several quarters, including in Q4. And then there\u2019s some other cost reduction actions through a cost improvement, if you will, through increased efficiencies in our plants and so on as volume increases.\nJohn Inch: Great. No, that\u2019s quite helpful. Thanks very much everyone. Appreciate it.\nBlake Moret: Thank you, John.\nSteve Etzel: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian, your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. And thanks Patrick for all the help. And I look forward to working with you again, Steve. Perhaps, the first question just around the top line. Again, I understand that I think you called out good orders and good backlog trends in that the short cycle business and products, but wanted perhaps to focus on that solutions and service and process piece. I think the process sales were down 20% or so in Q4 guiding for low-single digit growth in the year ahead. Maybe help us understand how quickly you get to that return to growth in fiscal 2021. And when we should start to see that solutions? And so this book-to-bill looks a bit healthy, I think was down year-on-year, the book-to-bill in Q4.\nBlake Moret: That\u2019s right, Julian. Typically the book-to-bill is down for solutions and services in Q4, as we see normal seasonality increased the amount of shipments in the quarter. That being said, we are expecting orders to pick up in the first half of the year. Oil and gas is probably the most subdued as we talked about in some other areas like mining and pulp and paper, the activity is a little bit more vigorous. We continue to focus on the OpEx expenditures in oil and gas through Sensia. I would also say if we look at the typical performance of our various businesses, as we come out of a downturn like this, products are almost always going to lead the solutions and services orders. We\u2019ve seen that repeated over many years and multiple cycles. So we\u2019re not surprised by this. But at the end of the day, you have to compete and win for each order that\u2019s up. There\u2019s still business out there. We are confident that that activity is going to increase, but we have to be on the winning side as that business comes up. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on, not only with our traditional resources, but with some of the new acquisitions. So we\u2019ve got a really helping in that space. And I mentioned Kalypso, but there are other unsung heroes when we look at some of the acquisitions in OT cybersecurity with Avnet and Orlo, when we look at MES tech and the ability to quote even more competitively for the delivery of software-based projects, those are all going to help us recover just as fast as possible as those projects increase in frequency.\nJulian Mitchell: Thank you. And then maybe Blake, just a more strategic one and perhaps we\u2019ll hear more about this at the Investor Day. But it did seem as if the broadening of that strategic alliance with PTC was quite substantive that you talked about a couple of weeks ago. Maybe give us some background as to why the relationship now includes PLM and SaaS. And maybe how your own perspectives on the benefits of co-offering PLM may have shifted, if at all?\nBlake Moret: Sure. Julian, I know a couple of aspects of the expanded relationship. The starting point is that we have a great foundation. The pace of competitive wins is picking up. I mentioned before that it seems to be catalyzing the increased size of all of our software wins; so not just what we\u2019re doing directly with PTC, but on the MES side as well, for instance, and then our own FactoryTalk analytics offering. Another specific example of the way that the partnership is evolving is that we\u2019re focused on annual recurring revenue now. So it\u2019s not just about the new annual contract value of wins, but it\u2019s also about the total value of the business, including the renewals. And of course, that\u2019s absolutely essential for us to be on the same side of the table, as we\u2019re both focused on increasing that recurring base. Specifically with respect to PLM and Onshape and some of their offerings, we see the opportunity to help pull through PTC in some of these digital thread opportunities, we preserve an open approach and respect customers\u2019 installed base. But having the ability when a customer is looking at PTC, the ability to include that in the digital thread offering is proving to be very valuable. And with the recent acquisition of Kalypso, we have formidable capabilities with respect to digital thread. So this is just another tool that we have at our disposal. And we continue to look for meaningful ways to integrate PTC technology with our own offering, not just on the software side, but also really importantly on the way that data is pulled from the control and brought up to that information layer.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nBlake Moret: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff, your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nBlake Moret: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Good morning. Two for me. First is just kind of on the software and control side, thanks for the timely restates. Kind of interesting, right, the software and control kind of in the two worst quarters of the pandemic, basically performed in line with intelligent devices. What if you could just speak to your view of kind of resiliency in that business over time? And as part of that, if we\u2019re going to talk ARR, can you baseline us on what it is for the fiscal year of 2020? So we are kind of level set here.\nBlake Moret: Yes. Jeff, I\u2019ll make a couple of comments. And then Patrick and Steve may add to that. I mean, software and control includes the essential heart of a control system. The control function, whether it\u2019s based in hardware or software or a combination of the two is processing the inputs and changing the states of outputs. And that\u2019s going to remain a persistent part of control systems in all of the industries that we serve. We see some evidence of that as we talked about the great performance in packaging on our end, compact logics really performed quite well relative to the rest of the control during the last couple of quarters. So we think that that\u2019s an essential functionality and regardless of where the execution point moves from hardware and firmware to pure software or back, depending on customer preferences, we\u2019re confident that we can continue to perform very well there. On the software side, the pure software side, we are increasing the focus on ARR. It\u2019s a little bit over 5% of sales currently. And as we talked about last Investor Day, as we\u2019ll talk about again next week, the goal is to bring it to 10% and more in the next few years, and we think we\u2019re on a good path to do that. I should add it takes all hands on deck to make that happen. It starts with great software, either that we\u2019re developing ourselves or that we\u2019re buying. It also includes increasing our selling capabilities and significant part of our recent investments is adding sales who had a specific focus on software and also the infrastructure within the company to make sure we do a great job of processing those orders and that we\u2019re decreasing churn rates and so on. So it\u2019s really the full company on board and an integrated effort to grow that.\nJeff Sprague: And then separately, just on the decision to go ex-amort, just kind of interested in the philosophical decision there. I mean, we\u2019ve seen it happen at other companies, so certainly you\u2019re not alone. Most of the placements that happened there was kind of a investor push for it because the amortization was quite high relative to GAAP EPS. And there was a clear disconnect here. What should we \u2013 if anything gleaned from making this adjustment, right, it\u2019s kind of 2% of earnings. I guess my read would be we\u2019ve got a much more active M&A pipeline coming at us, but any color there would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\nSteve Etzel: Sure. This is Steve. We did a lot of benchmarking, as you said, we did get a lot of investor input as it relates to this. We obviously have been on a path doing more acquisitions than perhaps in our history. We have a goal of growing top line more than a point per year from acquisitions and we have been doing more. And we thought now is the right time to make the change and come more in line with a lot of other companies that we compare our substance.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve, your line is open.\nSteve Tusa: Hi, good morning.\nBlake Moret: Good morning Steve.\nSteve Tusa: So just thinking about kind of the sequential or I guess the year-over-year performance, maybe a little bit better, because John kind of got you on the sequential side, 2Q last year you guys outperformed almost everybody by a lot. And anything you guys want to kind of highlight as far as the project comps there at all in the second quarter that we should take down of in our models?\nBlake Moret: Steve, I think we\u2019re in a period of time in general where things are going to be highly variable by geographies and by end markets and by end user, OEM split. So we\u2019re kind of top line there, you\u2019re correct and I think in Q2, it looks like our performance last year outpaced pretty much all of our competitors. And during this time, relative position and amount of business in different parts of the world, I think are going to have a big impact on the results. In general, the theme is of course towards recovery. And as we said, as we pull out from the Q3 trough, we expect gradually recovering conditions and a return to strong year-over-year growth in Q3 as industrial production returns to grow and as we have easier comps. The other point I would make regarding Q2 that you mentioned fiscal 2020, it was broad-based. Automotive, I think was a bit of a positive surprise, but it wasn\u2019t just automotive, but there were a number of industries that were positive in the quarter.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And then just \u2013 yes, go ahead. Sorry.\nPatrick Goris: I am just going to elaborate a little bit on what I mentioned earlier since you brought up Q2. But all of our bonus headwinds of $115 million for the full year, the headwind is going to play out by quarter something like $10 million headwind in Q1, $45 million to $50 million in Q2 and approaching $30 million per quarter in Q3 and Q4.\nSteve Tusa: Okay, great. Thanks for the color. And then just lastly on these new segment breakouts, on the Software & Control side, I mean, I think the majority of those sales are kind of logics and the PLCs, those margins and I think in 2019 at the peak were 30% for that segment, given that the vast majority of that segment is the hardware. Can I assume that hardware sale is pretty high margin for you guys?\nBlake Moret: Well, yes, no question that logics hardware is good margin for us. If you do the math and you look at what we\u2019ve provided on fiscal 2020 breakout by segment, about $1.7 billion in Software & Control and all of the software is in this segment. So that, we said it was over $500 million in fiscal 2020 of the pure software. And then, I should also mention, that this is the segment that is currently attractive in the majority of our investment. So whether it\u2019s in logics or it\u2019s in the software development as a percentage of sales this segment would have the highest investment.\nSteve Tusa: Right. And then PTC related sales that come through there, I think you\u2019ve said will flow through at your kind of normal incremental margin. So, you\u2019re basically booking similar margins on those PTC sales, if you will?\nSteve Etzel: Steve, the way you can think about it, if we package PTC and offerings to one of our customers we probably achieve between 30% and 40% incremental margins there, so in-line with overall company average, lower of course than it would be our own controllers or our own software.\nSteve Tusa: Yes. Great, thanks a lot for the color. I appreciate it.\nSteve Etzel: Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: You\u2019re next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andy, your line is open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning guys. Patrick, congrats. Steve, looking forward to working with you again.\nSteve Etzel: Thank you, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Blake. I know you spoke about this a bit in your prepared remarks, but can you give us a little more color into what you\u2019re seeing in terms of your customers, either reassuring or investing to avoid single points of failure? We know you\u2019ve talked about in the past, life sciences, semiconductors, are you seeing investment continuing to increase in these sectors or actually increasing outside of these sectors? And when you think about the order uptake you\u2019ve seen, would you characterize the significant amount of orders as it related to this type of investment?\nBlake Moret: Yes. As we\u2019ve talked about before Andy, life science is probably the area where we have the longest list of customers that have announced plans to do things in the U.S. Some of these have been public about what they\u2019re doing. You take about, what Becton, Dickinson is doing or Sanofi and so on, and other customers that we\u2019re working with, but they haven\u2019t yet disclosed that publicly and so we respect that. We\u2019ve also seen some high profile semiconductor announcements that we\u2019ve talked in the past about Taiwan Semi and the work that we\u2019re doing with them. And there are some others out there in other industries, our consumer electronics, consumer tools, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a steady cadence and we have \u2013 let\u2019s say get started kids, if you will to work with customers who are considering doing these sorts of things that our salespeople are familiar with. It\u2019s really a part of the overall attempts for resilience. So we\u2019re not seeing an avalanche of that reassuring. We see that steady, but the business that\u2019s coming out of it, it\u2019s meaningful. It\u2019s certainly in the millions of dollars that we\u2019re seeing there.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Thanks for that Blake. And then can you give us more color into what you\u2019re seeing in the automotive markets? You mentioned it was better than you expected, but down 20% in Q4, as you know was only modestly better than Q3, it declined and auto builds did improve materially globally. So we know you\u2019re guiding automotive being up 10% in FY 2021, was there anything that kind of held you back in Q4 versus build and maybe update us on sort of the EV transition we\u2019re seeing seems to be accelerating a bit that should help you, I think as you go into 2021.\nBlake Moret: Yes, we did see as with almost all our industries, so good sequential. It was so strong, a double-digit sequential increase in automotive. So up 20% gives us optimism. Then as we talk about, fiscal year 2021 get into around 10% growth in automotive. We think we have a line of sight on the projects and the improving MRO to substantiate that. And obviously within there, areas like electric vehicle that we think are particularly good for us as we see higher win rates in EV than across the general portfolio for automotive.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Thanks for that. Blake.\nBlake Moret: Thanks Andy, welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew, your line is open.\nAndrew Obin: Hi, guys. Good morning.\nBlake Moret: Hey, good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: So Patrick congratulations. And Steve, look forward to working with you again as everybody has mentioned. Maybe Patrick, I\u2019ll ask you a question about Mexican effects, I won\u2019t do that. Just a couple of questions, so first, you also announced in addition to PTC partnership, you also announced the expansion of your partnership with Microsoft. And I was just wondering, because Microsoft is aligned with PTC, but yet they\u2019re trying to do their own thing in industrial vertical. Can you just talk a little bit more, what it is you are doing more with Microsoft, because clearly you guys have been aligned for a long time, but is there anything new there? They\u2019re more focused on SaaS, more focused on cloud. So that\u2019s my first question.\nPatrick Goris: Sure. The primary focus of this new expansion of work with Microsoft is targeted at Azure infrastructure and the cloud. And so we\u2019re working with Microsoft and we\u2019ll be demonstrating some of our new capabilities that are already well along in the areas of design as well as information in using a SaaS approach for new capabilities. So these really complement our existing capabilities and are kind of a forerunner of a significant amount of new functionality, both on-prem and in the cloud that customers will see over the next year or so. So it\u2019s really, it\u2019s focused on combining forces using their expertise with Azure in our OT expertise to provide new design tools for customers and we\u2019re very excited about it. I\u2019m excited, not only about the functionality, the specific functionality that\u2019s going to bring, but it\u2019s the pace with which we were able to join forces, assemble teams and to come together to create new value. From the first meeting really that we talked about this with Microsoft to now it\u2019s been less than a year. And that\u2019s a great foreshadowing of things to come.\nAndrew Obin: Do you need to reconfigure your sales force to out-sale to sort of do more of the SaaS Azure sales?\nBlake Moret: We\u2019re certainly going to be adding additional talent and learning new motions within our sales force, but it\u2019s really a microcosm of the overall convergence of IT and OT. Our home field advantage is understanding of these customers and the operational technologies and what happens on the plant floor and how they make money or avoid downtime. And complimenting that with perspectives of people who understand the software selling motion is what we\u2019re right in the middle of now. We\u2019re making significant investments in new talent, training enablement for our overall sales force and so it\u2019s bringing that talent up together, the existing plus the new.\nAndrew Obin: And just a follow-up question, again with the new administration, frankly we are hearing from a lot of investors that new administration maybe mean less focused on reassuring, because tariffs will go away. What kind of conversations have you had with your customers, about sort of contingency plans and their longer-term strategy on capacity in the U.S. and globally, in light of the election results. Thank you.\nBlake Moret: We\u2019re encouraged in that, the Biden campaign and the Biden administration has talked about the importance of U.S. manufacturing. And so that is the single most important issue for us. And we\u2019re optimistic that they recognize the importance that manufacturing in this country plays as a part of the vital core of the American economy. And so we\u2019re looking forward to working with them through professional organizations and so on, to find ways to increase the manufacturing in the U.S. along with the attendant issue of workforce development which is a crucial issue for us as well.\nAndrew Obin: Very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel, your line is open.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for fitting me in here. So just want to go back to John\u2019s question on sequential sales. Did you say 1Q up 5% and I\u2019m not sure if that was what you indicated. Just normally 1Q is below 4Q, so I just want to make sure I got that right.\nPatrick Goris: Yes. So, we are seeing some momentum as I just described in the product side, but it\u2019s typical for Q1 for solutions to be down. So my general comment was roughly mid-single digit sequential growth. It could be a little slower than that in Q1. And that\u2019s part of the reason why we\u2019ve mentioned that Q1 EPS could be down sequentially, expected to be done sequentially from Q4 then as well as the sequential headwind from the temporary actions being reversed and bonus being reinstated.\nNigel Coe: Right. But the point is that there\u2019s enough momentum in products that offset the seasonal down take inflations?\nPatrick Goris: Yes, I think directionally that\u2019s probably the case.\nNigel Coe: Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And then the expansion of the relationship with PTC, one of your big competitors has taken a very strong view on the PLM, PLC integration. And I think historically Rockwell has been a bit more skeptical about that. I\u2019m just wondering, has there been a change in your view of integration amongst those layers? And then sort of within that, have you done all of the investment required to offer integrated solution with PTC or is there still some investment spending to be done around that?\nBlake Moret: Yes. Our view is that, our customer is going to have multiple applications to create their version of the digital thread and that\u2019s going to vary by different industries. So what you\u2019re looking for in terms of the digital thread in oil and gas is going to be different than what you\u2019re looking for in automotive typically. Let\u2019s say, we are selectively looking at integration between interesting parts of the PTC portfolio. One of the specific areas that Jim Heppelmann highlighted during LiveWorx this past summer was Onshape and our Emulate3D simulation capabilities. And so that\u2019s one area that\u2019s very interesting, and we have differentiated value. We\u2019re using it in our own facilities and it\u2019s helped us win competitively in other areas. But that doesn\u2019t mean that we have to have that capability in every instance in-house. So an open approach and respecting the investment that customer has already have made in terms of training and installation, different vendors, application software in industry is an important tenant of our approach to the market. And so we don\u2019t necessarily need to own everything, but where we pick particularly interesting use cases like the one I just mentioned between Onshape and Emulate3D, that\u2019s an example where we will go deeper and we will provide additional integration tools to add that value.\nNigel Coe: Right. Well, thanks Blake. Thanks, Steve. And Patrick, good luck.\nSteve Etzel: Thank you, Nigel.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and answer-session. I will now turn the call back over to Jessica Kourakos for closing remarks.\nJessica Kourakos: Thank you. Thank you, Amy. I\u2019ll turn it back to the Blake for few final comments.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Jessica. Nobody is better positioned than Rockwell and our partners to bring information technology and industrial operational technology together. We remain focused on the well-being of our employees, and we continue to manage thoughtfully through a gradual recovery. At the same time, we are happy to see the positive results of steps being taken to accelerate profitable growth. I also want to wish Patrick all the best. Patrick, you\u2019ve played a big role in our success, and you will be missed. We wish you all good health and thank you for your interest and support.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. At this time, you may just disconnect. Thank you.",

            "name": "Steve Etzel",
            "content": "Thank you, Patrick. Moving to Slide 13 product order trends, this slide shows our daily order trends for our products, which account for about two-thirds of our overall sales and represent our shorter-cycle businesses. As we expected, order intake for products continued to improve during the quarter. Our guidance for fiscal 2021 assumes this trend will continue. Daily product order performance through October continued to improve on a year-over-year basis, down low-single digits. Solutions orders are recovering slower than product orders. Let's move on to the next Slide 14, guidance for fiscal 2021. As Blake mentioned, we are expecting sales of about $6.8 billion in fiscal 2021, up about 7.5% at the midpoint of the range. We expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 3.5% to 6.5% and about 5% at the mid-point of our range. From a calendarization viewpoint, we expect first half organic sales to be down compared to fiscal 2020, followed by a stronger second half with organic sales up mid-to-high teens. As a reminder, first half fiscal 2020 organic sales were about flat, followed by double-digit declines in the second half. We therefore expect easier comps starting in Q3 of fiscal 2021. We expect segment operating margin to be between 20% and 20.5% probably at the higher end of that range. At the midpoint, our guidance assumes full year core earnings conversion, which excludes the impacts of currency and acquisitions of between 30% and 35%. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect to offset a $150 million year-over-year headwind related to fully funding our incentive compensation and reversing fiscal 2020 temporary cost reduction actions with additional productivity. We expect the full-year adjusted effective tax rate will be about 14%. This includes a 300-basis point benefit related to discrete items which we expect to realize late in the fiscal year. Our underlying adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be 17% to 18%. As disclosed in our earnings release, we are modifying our definition of adjusted EPS beginning in fiscal 2021. Under the new definition, we are now also excluding purchase accounting depreciation and amortization expense from adjusted EPS. This has the effect of increasing adjusted EPS by approximately $0.20 on a full year basis. Please note that we filed an 8-K this morning that provides historical information reflecting the new definition of adjusted EPS, as well as recast historical information for our new operating segments that we announced previously. Our adjusted EPS guidance range on the new basis is $8.45 to $8.85. This compares to fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS of $7.87 on the new basis. On an apples-to-apples basis, at the midpoint of the range, this represents 10% adjusted EPS growth on about 5% higher organic sales. We expect adjusted EPS to improve throughout the year and anticipate first quarter fiscal 2021 adjusted EPS to be lower than our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter performance, primarily as a result of a $0.30 sequential headwind related to increased incentive compensation expense and the reversal of our temporary cost actions as of the end of November. Finally, we expect full-year 2021 free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. This assumes $150 million of capital expenditures and a $50 million voluntary pre-tax U.S. pension contribution. A few additional comments on fiscal 2021 guidance, corporate and other expense, which we previously referred to as general corporate net expense, is expected to be around $105 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2021 is expected to be between $90 million and $95 million, a little lower than fiscal 2020. Finally, we're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 117 million shares. The next Slide 15 provides the adjusted EPS walk from fiscal 2020 to the fiscal 2021 guidance midpoint. Moving from left to right, fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS was $7.68 on the old definition. Next you see the $0.19 impact of the new definition of adjusted EPS. So, fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS on the new basis was $7.87. Core performance is expected to contribute about $1.90. This includes the benefit of higher organic sales, as well as the benefit of our cost reduction actions. Reinstatement of the bonus and reversal of the temporary cost actions, together, will be a headwind of about $1.15. As mentioned in last quarter, we expect these headwinds to be offset by productivity, which is in core. Currency forecasts project a weaker U.S. dollar compared to fiscal 2020, which should contribute about $0.10 to EPS. The higher tax rate is expected to be about a $0.15 headwind. Acquisitions made during fiscal 2020, and so far this year, are expected to add about $0.10. Note that Sensia is now in core, as October 1 was the one-year anniversary of the formation of the joint venture. As mentioned, at the midpoint of our guidance range, adjusted EPS is $8.65. Moving on to the next Slide 16, I'll make a few comments on our capital deployment framework. You may recognize this slide from our last Investor Day. Our capital deployment priorities remain the same. Our first priority is organic growth. After that, we focus capital deployment on inorganic activities. Then we focus on capital returns to shareowners, through our dividend and then repurchases. Our capital deployment plans for fiscal 2021 include dividends of about $500 million. As a reminder, we announced a 5% dividend increase last week. Consistent with our past track record, we expect our remaining capital deployment to include a balance of inorganic investments and share repurchases. We resumed share repurchases on October 1, the beginning of our fiscal year. In summary, our guidance assumes a continued sequential improvement in organic sales performance. Cost actions are expected to offset the significant headwind of reinstating incentive compensation and reversing temporary cost actions and we expect about 10% adjusted EPS growth and continued strong free cash flow conversion. Turning to Slide, 17, I'll finish with a comment about our new segment structure which is effective for fiscal 2021. As a reminder, our first quarter fiscal 2021 results will be reported in the new, three-segment format as shown here. With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Hi, John, this is Steve. We expect a gradual sequential recovery throughout the year, including into the first quarter. And as we said on the call, that implies a first half decline year-over-year, and then a second half year-over-year growth rate in mid- to high-teens. Yes. John, I think it's best to think of it as a mid-single digit quarter-to-quarter sequential growth in fiscal 2021. Sure. John, the $15 headwind that you see there on the walk is the bonus rehearsal, I'm sorry, the bonus reinstatement and the temporary cost reversal. That bonus is about $115 million in and of itself for the full year. I will point out by the way as it relates to the bonus; it's obviously a full year headwind. The biggest headwind we'll see on a year-over-year bonus is in the second, I'm sorry, yes, the second quarter, but each quarter will have some headwinds. In terms of some of the structural savings and so on, on that bridge, that's all in core. We have about $60 million of structural savings, which relate to restructurings that we've taken over the last several quarters, including in Q4. And then there's some other cost reduction actions through a cost improvement, if you will, through increased efficiencies in our plants and so on as volume increases. Thanks. Sure. This is Steve. We did a lot of benchmarking, as you said, we did get a lot of investor input as it relates to this. We obviously have been on a path doing more acquisitions than perhaps in our history. We have a goal of growing top line more than a point per year from acquisitions and we have been doing more. And we thought now is the right time to make the change and come more in line with a lot of other companies that we compare our substance. Steve, the way you can think about it, if we package PTC and offerings to one of our customers we probably achieve between 30% and 40% incremental margins there, so in-line with overall company average, lower of course than it would be our own controllers or our own software. Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Andy. Thank you, Nigel."

            "content": "Thanks, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Before we begin discussing our results and outlook, I'd like to make a few opening remarks. I first want to address Patrick's recent announcement that he will be leaving Rockwell to start a new chapter in his career. In his 14 years with us, the company has continued its long legacy of financial discipline and delivering superior shareowner returns, and we wish him well in his next pursuit. Many of you know Steve Etzel, who will be stepping in as CFO on an interim basis. Steve has been with us for over 30 years and over these years has run investor relations, treasury, and corporate FP&A. The Board and I have full confidence he will reinforce our strong financial framework and continued commitment to superior shareowner returns. Patrick and Steve are ensuring a very smooth transition, while we consider internal and external candidates for a permanent successor. I also want to send my deepest thanks to the thousands of employees who have been working under very difficult conditions, including the temporary pay cuts we implemented in May, to help us preserve jobs and to serve our customers during the pandemic. These cost actions enabled us to protect our company's financial strength and allowed us to continue making important targeted investments to drive our future growth. Now, with business conditions gradually improving, we will reverse the temporary pay reductions by the end of November, one month earlier than expected. In addition, our guidance for next year assumes a return to a fully funded bonus plan. Because of our employees' hard work and dedication, we have never been so well positioned for what lies ahead. This is another testament to the type of culture we have at Rockwell and I couldn't be prouder. Turning now to our Q4 results on Slide 3. While business conditions remain difficult relative to a year ago, we are pleased with the steady improvement we're seeing. In Q4, total reported sales declined by 9% versus the prior year. Organic sales were down about 12% versus prior year, but grew 10% sequentially. Product sales outperformed our expectations and were driven by better-than-expected results in Drives and Motion. Motion performance was led by our Independent Cart Technology, where we received the largest single order in Rockwell Automation's history. We won this multi-year project from the U.S. Navy based on a need for precise, highly responsive motion control not available with traditional systems, and on Rockwell's long track record as a dependable U.S. supplier. Independent Cart provides a new way for us to add value and drive growth. You'll be hearing more about it, and other innovative technologies, at our upcoming Investor Day on November 17. Turning to Information Solutions and Connected Services. Organic sales were up low-single digits versus prior year. IS/CS orders grew double digits over the prior year in both software and connected services. IS/CS sales reached approximately $400 million in fiscal 2020 on an organic basis and were well in excess of that when including all of our recent inorganic investments. Demand for software sold as a result of our PTC partnership is also increasing rapidly as we enter the new fiscal year, and we're very happy with the recent extension and expansion of this relationship. Together with PTC, we added over 200 new customer logos in fiscal 2020, and deal sizes in our Information Solutions software business continue to grow. The synergies of our combined offering are very evident to customers. In Connected Services, our recent Kalypso acquisition is doing particularly well and is helping us further differentiate. Kalypso is already contributing to some large competitive wins, and they just had the best orders quarter in their history. Total sales include a three point positive contribution from inorganic investments, led by our Sensia joint venture, along with the Kalypso and ASEM acquisitions. Total backlog in the quarter grew double digits versus the prior year and grew high-single digits on an organic basis. Our Q4 Solutions and Services book-to-bill was 0.87 and full-year book-to-bill was over 1. This Solutions and Services book-to-bill does not include the large Independent Cart order we received from the U.S. Navy. Turning to profitability, strong segment operating margin performance of over 20% in the quarter was flat with last year on lower sales, underscoring our increasing business resilience. Free cash flow was also very strong, reinforcing our solid balance sheet and liquidity position. Let's now turn to Slide 4, where I will provide a few highlights of our Q4 organic end-market performance. Our discrete market segment declined approximately 10%, with automotive performing better than we expected, driven by stronger MRO and projects sales. Among the more notable projects in the quarter was a significant OT cybersecurity win in Europe with one of the major German car companies. And in electric vehicles, we saw momentum continue in the industry with battery manufacturers and brand owners. We are excited by recent announcements from both new and established automakers as they focus on production of compelling new EV offerings. In semiconductor, we had another very strong quarter and grew high-single digits versus the prior year. This vertical is benefiting from a variety of secular tailwinds such as the rise of smart devices and the resulting internet of things, along with the need for faster data centers and the adoption of 5G wireless technology. In addition to facilities management, which has been a strong foundation for us, we see an opportunity for our material handling technology as well as our software. In e-commerce, we had a significant expansion win at Cloostermans, one of the largest and most important suppliers to the global ecommerce industry. This is another industry with long-term secular tailwinds that will continue to invest in automation and industrial software to support its tremendous future growth. Turning now to our hybrid market segment. This segment declined a little less than 5% and outperformed the discrete and process industry segments. Food and beverage and life sciences each declined low-single digits for both the quarter and for the year. Packaging OEMs had another strong quarter and delivered double-digit growth versus the prior year. We believe these markets will outperform in fiscal 2021. Eco-industrial outperformed other industries in the quarter, driven by growth in water, where we continue to benefit from a differentiated offering that integrates control, power, and industrial software. Tire and rubber was down double digits but performed in line with our expectations. In the quarter, we had key wins at important strategic accounts, including Cooper Tire, which continues to strengthen its global track and trace capabilities to support the company's long-term growth plans. They chose FactoryTalk software because of our strong MES and analytics capabilities, and our differentiated ability to connect to both Rockwell and non-Rockwell control platforms. Once again, our strong software portfolio, our ecosystem of best-of-breed partners, and our expertise in connecting diverse manufacturing environments were all important reasons Rockwell won this very competitive project with Cooper Tire. Process markets were down approximately 20%. Oil and gas was a little weaker than we expected, but that was partially offset by better-than-expected performance in most other process markets like mining and pulp and paper. Sensia held up fairly well during the quarter and continues to demonstrate their competitive differentiation. Turning now to Slide 5 and our organic regional sales performance in the quarter. North America organic sales declined by 12% versus the prior year. Business conditions improved through the quarter, particularly in products, where orders significantly exceeded our expectations. While our large Independent Cart win was part of that result, we also saw great software orders within Information Solutions that more than doubled versus the prior year, creating strong momentum entering the new fiscal year. In EMEA, sales declined 12% largely due to CapEx delays. These were partially offset by strong growth in water. We also saw growth in life sciences and PPE-related machine builder business. Sales in the Asia Pacific region declined 9% largely due to declines in end user business within automotive and mass transit. Double-digit growth in mining and life sciences partially offset those declines. China sales declined, but orders grew mid-single digits year-over-year in the quarter. Latin America declines were led by mining and oil and gas. Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review highlights for the full year. It's an understatement to say that fiscal 2020 turned out very different than the plans we discussed together at a great Investor Day during an incredible Automation Fair in Chicago last November. The shadow of the pandemic soon created unique challenges, but I'm proud of our ability to respond while taking big steps forward in the execution of our strategic vision. We kept the safety of our employees at the top of our list and continued to provide dedicated service to our customers, many of whom are producing the food, water, protective gear, and medicine that keep us going. The pandemic has focused us all on what's truly important. We took thoughtful actions to manage costs through this pandemic while at the same time protect strategic investments, including some very big internal development projects. And you can see those investments drive the performance of our software business, which reached over $500 million in revenue in fiscal 2020 and was one of the best performing areas of our business in both orders and sales this year. We deployed over $500 million for inorganic investments that contributed almost four points to our top line growth; and we deployed over $700 million in cash toward dividends and repurchases enabled by our strong free cash flow. I am tremendously proud of what we've accomplished in fiscal 2020, and I'm excited about the resulting momentum as we enter fiscal 2021. Turning now to our outlook on Slide 7. As I said earlier, we saw strong sequential momentum exiting the year. Industrial production is projected to grow in the second half of our fiscal year. So it may take a couple of quarters for us to climb back to year-over-year sales growth from the Q3 trough in fiscal 2020. We expect double-digit year-over-year growth during our third and fourth quarters. Of course, we are all closely monitoring global infection levels related to this pandemic, but we are not assuming a widespread shutdown of customer manufacturing operations. We expect reported sales to grow about 7.5% at the midpoint of the guidance range, including 5% of organic growth and over a point of growth from our fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 acquisitions to date. In addition, we are adopting annual recurring revenue as an important metric for the company and have added ARR as a performance metric in our incentive compensation framework beginning this year. ARR is expected to grow double digits in fiscal 2021, after showing over 6% growth in fiscal 2020. This is further evidence of our ability to build an even more resilient business model. Adjusted EPS is expected to reach $8.65 at the midpoint, which is up 10% from last year's fiscal 2020 results. We are targeting free cash flow conversion of 100%. A more detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 8. I won't go into the details on this slide, but as you can see, we expect positive organic sales growth in all of our key end markets next year with the exception of oil and gas. With that, let me now turn it over to Patrick who will elaborate on our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 financial performance. We'll then have Steve discuss our fiscal 2021 outlook in his remarks. Patrick? Thanks, Steve. We continue to see our customers take steps to increase their resilience, agility, and sustainability. Resilience includes investments to reduce single points of failure, with a growing list of companies announcing plans to build or expand North American operations. Our strong market share in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada make us a natural beneficiary of these plans. Other measures to increase resilience include increased automation, traceability, and remote monitoring, which are all Rockwell strengths. We're making investments in our own operations, which we'll showcase during next week's Investor Day. Our contribution to operations agility is demonstrated by our great results in consumer and life sciences packaging equipment and the growth of our software to manage the increasingly dynamic SKU's offered by our customers. The pandemic has prompted new food and beverage packaging formats, along with quantities of testing kits, therapeutic drugs, and hopefully very soon, doses of vaccines. Quite simply, these cannot be manufactured at the necessary scale, safety, and quality without automation. We're proud of the role our innovation is playing at Pfizer, Roche, and many other companies as we help the world recover. The need to increase the sustainability of industrial processes is only increasing. Clean drinking water is one of the reasons our Eco Industrial focus is so important for the future, along with electric vehicles and the everyday ways our products reduce energy consumption in every industry. This expanded value gives us optimism for the coming years. In fiscal 2021 we are guiding to high single-digit reported growth, paced by our highest-margin segment. This results in guidance that also includes double-digit EPS growth. I'm looking forward to telling you more about our plans next week, with the help of great customers, partners, and a very talented Rockwell leadership team. With that, let me pass the baton back to Jessica to begin the Q&A session. Good morning. Scott, we can't talk in specifics about the particular application, but I can tell you that Independent Cart in general allows for more precise motion control than some of the traditional methods of servo amps and other types of technology. So with the kind of acceleration and deceleration profiles that are needed for some of these high performance applications, Independent Cart was really a differentiated solution. It also has to operate and as you can imagine, very difficult environments. The vital point is that, while we don't talk as much about our government business, now Rockwell's been a trusted U.S. supplier to the government for a long time, and so some of these premium high-performance applications were a natural fit. Scott, one of the things that we've really been proud of our partnership with PTC is good diversity of customers and geographies that we've been able penetrate with the combined offering. So, while food and beverage and consumer-facing industries, as they are large for Rockwell's overall business are the source of a lot of the applications. It goes across automotive and mining as well as many of the other industries that we talk about all the time. It gives us new ways to win in these, and some of the things that we're most excited about that we've talked about before are that it's not just on top of Rockwell control systems, about half of these applications are going on top of competitive control systems. So it's a new way to add value and to be meaningful in those customers' digital transformations. It's really across the various industries and across the geographies. We have wins in every geography we serve. Thanks, Scott. Yes. What I would also add John is that we did see good orders in October in terms of improvement. So, particularly on the products, that was an encouraging sign as we entered the year. We have to say that services and solutions order recovery is lagging behind those product orders, but products are really the leading indicator that we look at. Thank you, John. That's right, Julian. Typically the book-to-bill is down for solutions and services in Q4, as we see normal seasonality increased the amount of shipments in the quarter. That being said, we are expecting orders to pick up in the first half of the year. Oil and gas is probably the most subdued as we talked about in some other areas like mining and pulp and paper, the activity is a little bit more vigorous. We continue to focus on the OpEx expenditures in oil and gas through Sensia. I would also say if we look at the typical performance of our various businesses, as we come out of a downturn like this, products are almost always going to lead the solutions and services orders. We've seen that repeated over many years and multiple cycles. So we're not surprised by this. But at the end of the day, you have to compete and win for each order that's up. There's still business out there. We are confident that that activity is going to increase, but we have to be on the winning side as that business comes up. And that's what we're focused on, not only with our traditional resources, but with some of the new acquisitions. So we've got a really helping in that space. And I mentioned Kalypso, but there are other unsung heroes when we look at some of the acquisitions in OT cybersecurity with Avnet and Orlo, when we look at MES tech and the ability to quote even more competitively for the delivery of software-based projects, those are all going to help us recover just as fast as possible as those projects increase in frequency. Sure. Julian, I know a couple of aspects of the expanded relationship. The starting point is that we have a great foundation. The pace of competitive wins is picking up. I mentioned before that it seems to be catalyzing the increased size of all of our software wins; so not just what we're doing directly with PTC, but on the MES side as well, for instance, and then our own FactoryTalk analytics offering. Another specific example of the way that the partnership is evolving is that we're focused on annual recurring revenue now. So it's not just about the new annual contract value of wins, but it's also about the total value of the business, including the renewals. And of course, that's absolutely essential for us to be on the same side of the table, as we're both focused on increasing that recurring base. Specifically with respect to PLM and Onshape and some of their offerings, we see the opportunity to help pull through PTC in some of these digital thread opportunities, we preserve an open approach and respect customers' installed base. But having the ability when a customer is looking at PTC, the ability to include that in the digital thread offering is proving to be very valuable. And with the recent acquisition of Kalypso, we have formidable capabilities with respect to digital thread. So this is just another tool that we have at our disposal. And we continue to look for meaningful ways to integrate PTC technology with our own offering, not just on the software side, but also really importantly on the way that data is pulled from the control and brought up to that information layer. You're welcome. Good morning, Jeff. Yes. Jeff, I'll make a couple of comments. And then Patrick and Steve may add to that. I mean, software and control includes the essential heart of a control system. The control function, whether it's based in hardware or software or a combination of the two is processing the inputs and changing the states of outputs. And that's going to remain a persistent part of control systems in all of the industries that we serve. We see some evidence of that as we talked about the great performance in packaging on our end, compact logics really performed quite well relative to the rest of the control during the last couple of quarters. So we think that that's an essential functionality and regardless of where the execution point moves from hardware and firmware to pure software or back, depending on customer preferences, we're confident that we can continue to perform very well there. On the software side, the pure software side, we are increasing the focus on ARR. It's a little bit over 5% of sales currently. And as we talked about last Investor Day, as we'll talk about again next week, the goal is to bring it to 10% and more in the next few years, and we think we're on a good path to do that. I should add it takes all hands on deck to make that happen. It starts with great software, either that we're developing ourselves or that we're buying. It also includes increasing our selling capabilities and significant part of our recent investments is adding sales who had a specific focus on software and also the infrastructure within the company to make sure we do a great job of processing those orders and that we're decreasing churn rates and so on. So it's really the full company on board and an integrated effort to grow that. Good morning Steve. Steve, I think we're in a period of time in general where things are going to be highly variable by geographies and by end markets and by end user, OEM split. So we're kind of top line there, you're correct and I think in Q2, it looks like our performance last year outpaced pretty much all of our competitors. And during this time, relative position and amount of business in different parts of the world, I think are going to have a big impact on the results. In general, the theme is of course towards recovery. And as we said, as we pull out from the Q3 trough, we expect gradually recovering conditions and a return to strong year-over-year growth in Q3 as industrial production returns to grow and as we have easier comps. The other point I would make regarding Q2 that you mentioned fiscal 2020, it was broad-based. Automotive, I think was a bit of a positive surprise, but it wasn't just automotive, but there were a number of industries that were positive in the quarter. Well, yes, no question that logics hardware is good margin for us. If you do the math and you look at what we've provided on fiscal 2020 breakout by segment, about $1.7 billion in Software & Control and all of the software is in this segment. So that, we said it was over $500 million in fiscal 2020 of the pure software. And then, I should also mention, that this is the segment that is currently attractive in the majority of our investment. So whether it's in logics or it's in the software development as a percentage of sales this segment would have the highest investment. Yes. As we've talked about before Andy, life science is probably the area where we have the longest list of customers that have announced plans to do things in the U.S. Some of these have been public about what they're doing. You take about, what Becton, Dickinson is doing or Sanofi and so on, and other customers that we're working with, but they haven't yet disclosed that publicly and so we respect that. We've also seen some high profile semiconductor announcements that we've talked in the past about Taiwan Semi and the work that we're doing with them. And there are some others out there in other industries, our consumer electronics, consumer tools, I'd say it's a steady cadence and we have \u2013 let's say get started kids, if you will to work with customers who are considering doing these sorts of things that our salespeople are familiar with. It's really a part of the overall attempts for resilience. So we're not seeing an avalanche of that reassuring. We see that steady, but the business that's coming out of it, it's meaningful. It's certainly in the millions of dollars that we're seeing there. Yes, we did see as with almost all our industries, so good sequential. It was so strong, a double-digit sequential increase in automotive. So up 20% gives us optimism. Then as we talk about, fiscal year 2021 get into around 10% growth in automotive. We think we have a line of sight on the projects and the improving MRO to substantiate that. And obviously within there, areas like electric vehicle that we think are particularly good for us as we see higher win rates in EV than across the general portfolio for automotive. Thanks Andy, welcome. Hey, good morning, Andrew. We're certainly going to be adding additional talent and learning new motions within our sales force, but it's really a microcosm of the overall convergence of IT and OT. Our home field advantage is understanding of these customers and the operational technologies and what happens on the plant floor and how they make money or avoid downtime. And complimenting that with perspectives of people who understand the software selling motion is what we're right in the middle of now. We're making significant investments in new talent, training enablement for our overall sales force and so it's bringing that talent up together, the existing plus the new. We're encouraged in that, the Biden campaign and the Biden administration has talked about the importance of U.S. manufacturing. And so that is the single most important issue for us. And we're optimistic that they recognize the importance that manufacturing in this country plays as a part of the vital core of the American economy. And so we're looking forward to working with them through professional organizations and so on, to find ways to increase the manufacturing in the U.S. along with the attendant issue of workforce development which is a crucial issue for us as well. Yes. Our view is that, our customer is going to have multiple applications to create their version of the digital thread and that's going to vary by different industries. So what you're looking for in terms of the digital thread in oil and gas is going to be different than what you're looking for in automotive typically. Let's say, we are selectively looking at integration between interesting parts of the PTC portfolio. One of the specific areas that Jim Heppelmann highlighted during LiveWorx this past summer was Onshape and our Emulate3D simulation capabilities. And so that's one area that's very interesting, and we have differentiated value. We're using it in our own facilities and it's helped us win competitively in other areas. But that doesn't mean that we have to have that capability in every instance in-house. So an open approach and respecting the investment that customer has already have made in terms of training and installation, different vendors, application software in industry is an important tenant of our approach to the market. And so we don't necessarily need to own everything, but where we pick particularly interesting use cases like the one I just mentioned between Onshape and Emulate3D, that's an example where we will go deeper and we will provide additional integration tools to add that value. Thanks, Jessica. Nobody is better positioned than Rockwell and our partners to bring information technology and industrial operational technology together. We remain focused on the well-being of our employees, and we continue to manage thoughtfully through a gradual recovery. At the same time, we are happy to see the positive results of steps being taken to accelerate profitable growth. I also want to wish Patrick all the best. Patrick, you've played a big role in our success, and you will be missed. We wish you all good health and thank you for your interest and support."

            "name": "Patrick Goris",
            "content": "Thank you, Blake, and good morning everyone. I'll start on Slide 9, Fourth Quarter Key Financial Information. Sales, segment margin, Adjusted EPS and free cash flow were all better than expected in the fourth quarter, mainly as a result of better organic sales growth and productivity. Organic sales improved as the quarter progressed and were up 10% sequentially versus Q3. Compared to last year, Q4 organic sales were down 12% and acquisitions contributed just over 3% to total growth. Currency translation was a smaller headwind than expected and decreased sales by 0.3 points. Overall company backlog increased year-over-year in the quarter. Backlog for our short-cycle products was up double digits from a year-over-year and sequential perspective, even excluding the very large Independent Cart order Blake referred to earlier. Segment operating margin was 20.2%, the same as last year. The negative impact of lower sales was partially offset by a combination of temporary and structural cost actions. Fourth quarter results included about $10 million of restructuring charges which are expected to yield over $15 million in additional annualized structural cost savings, most of these savings will be realized in fiscal 2021. General corporate net expense was $22 million, pretty much in line with what we expected. As I mentioned earlier, adjusted EPS of $1.87 was better than expected, mainly as a result of better organic sales, productivity, and a slightly lower tax rate. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 15%, a bit lower than we expected, due to a slightly different geographic mix of our pre-tax income. Free cash flow performance remained strong. We generated over $300 million of free cash flow in the quarter, well over 100% conversion on adjusted income. Note that this result includes a voluntary $50 million pre-tax contribution made to the U.S. pension plan. This voluntary pension contribution was not reflected in our prior guidance. Slide 10 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our operating segments. Organic sales of both segments improved significantly compared to last quarter. Both segments were up about 10% on an organic basis compared to Q3, though organic sales remained lower compared to last year. Segment margin of both segments increased over 300 basis points compared to Q3, mainly due to higher organic sales, but also as a result of cost control including a full quarter benefit of our cost reduction actions and generally improving operating efficiencies. Compared to last year, Architecture & Software margins were up 100 basis points, despite the impact of lower sales, mainly as a result of our cost actions, including lower incentive compensation. Segment margins for the Control Products & Solutions segment declined 60 basis points compared to last year, with cost actions offsetting most of the impact of lower organic sales. The next Slide 11, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q4 fiscal 2019 to Q4 fiscal 2020. As you can see, core performance was down about $0.15 on a 12% organic sales decline. This implies core earnings conversion, that is, excluding the effects of acquisitions and currency of a little below 20%, which is a bit better than the outlook I shared with you in July. A positive adjusted EPS contribution from acquisitions is offset by unfavorable currency impacts. Slide 12 provides key financial information for full year fiscal 2020. After a good start to the fiscal year, we experienced significant year-over-year sales declines in the second half as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Organic sales declined 8% for the fiscal year. Our cost reduction actions protected key investments and helped to partially mitigate the impact of lower sales. We selectively increased investments in some of our highest priority areas. R&D expense was about flat compared to fiscal 2019, and R&D as a percent of sales increased further to 5.9% of sales in fiscal 2020. Full year segment margin remained at about 20% compared to record 22% segment margins last year, and Adjusted EPS was down 11%. Free cash flow performance remained strong, and excluding the $50 million voluntary pension contribution in fiscal 2020, was flat compared to last year. Free cash flow conversion was over 110% of adjusted income. And finally, return on invested capital remained well above our target of over 20%. Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to mention that we deployed about $1.3 billion of capital towards acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases in fiscal 2020. Our capital structure and liquidity remain very strong. At September 30, our fiscal year end, cash on the balance sheet was over $700 million, and our total debt was about $2 billion. During the fourth quarter, we paid off the $400 million term loan that we executed earlier in the year, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at September 30 was 1.0. With that, Steve. Thank you, Scott. This contract with the Navy is interesting. I mean, I haven't heard you talk about Independent Cart in a while. What is the U.S. Navy doing with the technology? Good morning, John. Thank you. I am just going to elaborate a little bit on what I mentioned earlier since you brought up Q2. But all of our bonus headwinds of $115 million for the full year, the headwind is going to play out by quarter something like $10 million headwind in Q1, $45 million to $50 million in Q2 and approaching $30 million per quarter in Q3 and Q4. Sure. The primary focus of this new expansion of work with Microsoft is targeted at Azure infrastructure and the cloud. And so we're working with Microsoft and we'll be demonstrating some of our new capabilities that are already well along in the areas of design as well as information in using a SaaS approach for new capabilities. So these really complement our existing capabilities and are kind of a forerunner of a significant amount of new functionality, both on-prem and in the cloud that customers will see over the next year or so. So it's really, it's focused on combining forces using their expertise with Azure in our OT expertise to provide new design tools for customers and we're very excited about it. I'm excited, not only about the functionality, the specific functionality that's going to bring, but it's the pace with which we were able to join forces, assemble teams and to come together to create new value. From the first meeting really that we talked about this with Microsoft to now it's been less than a year. And that's a great foreshadowing of things to come. Yes. So, we are seeing some momentum as I just described in the product side, but it's typical for Q1 for solutions to be down. So my general comment was roughly mid-single digit sequential growth. It could be a little slower than that in Q1. And that's part of the reason why we've mentioned that Q1 EPS could be down sequentially, expected to be done sequentially from Q4 then as well as the sequential headwind from the temporary actions being reversed and bonus being reinstated. Yes, I think directionally that's probably the case."

[Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the call over to Jessica Kourakos, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Kourakos, please go ahead.\nJessica Kourakos: Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation\u2019s Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Patrick Goris, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include and our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at the website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today\u2019s call. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. So with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Blake.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Jessica, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Before we begin discussing our results and outlook, I\u2019d like to make just a few opening remarks. While we, as a company, are managing well in this environment, we are highly sensitive to the toll this is taking on our employees during this time. Beyond the fear of a loved one getting sick, racial injustice is on our minds as we develop actions as a company, and as individuals, that will help put a permanent end to the denial of fundamental human rights. Additionally, thousands of our employees continue to work under very difficult conditions, including the temporary pay cuts we implemented in May. These pay cuts were necessary to better align our costs to current business conditions while preserving jobs, but there is a limit to how long they can remain in place. I hope we would be in a position to announce a firm end-date to the temporary pay reductions by now, since our goal has always been to reverse them as soon as possible. However, business conditions remain weak and the recent surge of COVID-19 infections has worried all of us, and nobody can predict with accuracy when a combination of social distancing practices, therapeutic medicines, and eventual vaccines will turn the tide. We do intend to reverse the temporary pay reductions by the end of December and hopefully sooner. In addition, this quarter we will make another special payment to our manufacturing associates worldwide, who are on the front lines of maintaining our essential operations. There are many reasons to be optimistic, and I am immensely proud of all of our employees and the great work they are doing. Our Environmental, Health, and Safety team is working around the clock to keep employees safe, and our technology is crucial to projects that are increasing mask and respirator production to far higher levels than four months ago. Candidate therapeutics and vaccines are being produced and packaged with the help of our innovation and expertise around the world. In short, our employees are having a direct impact on protecting the health of millions of people around the world, and I want to thank them all for their dedication. Turning now to our results on Slide 3. While business conditions remain difficult, and results in Q3 were down year-over-year, earnings were higher than we expected for the quarter, primarily driven by better organic sales. Total sales declined by 16% versus the prior year, including a three-point contribution from inorganic investments. Organic sales were down about 17.5%, and better than the 20% decline we were expecting heading into the quarter. Product sales outperformed our expectations, and were driven by better performance in Logix, Motion and Network and Security Infrastructure. We also had a number of new strategic wins in process applications against major process competitors. These wins spanned several industries this quarter, including Life Sciences, Food & Beverage and Oil & Gas. One of the more notable wins was with Companhia Cacique de Caf\u00e9 Soluvel, the largest exporter of instant coffee in Brazil and one of the largest in the world. They are building a new, technologically advanced coffee plant to expand production capacity. This was a highly competitive greenfield win, and we beat our biggest competitors based on our technology and track record with the customer. This win includes a broad suite of Rockwell technology: FactoryTalk Innovation Suite software, drives, Connected Services, as well as newly-released process control technology within Logix that enhances our differentiation against traditional DCS systems. Turning to Information Solutions and Connected Services. Sales were down slightly, partly due to travel restrictions and limited access to customer sites. However, IS/CS orders grew double digits over the prior year and showed strong growth in both software as well as connected services. Turning now to earnings. Adjusted EPS was $1.27, and our strong cash flow performance further reinforces our already-strong balance sheet and liquidity position. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 4, where I will provide a few highlights of our Q3 organic end-market performance. Our Discrete market segment declined approximately 20% with Automotive performing better than we projected in April, based on the factory closures at that time. Semiconductor saw positive growth in the quarter, up mid-single digits, and continues to benefit from secular tailwinds in 5G, datacenters, and the Internet of Things. We also see ecommerce as an important emerging driver of our discrete business, due to the excellent fit of our technology with fulfillment center applications. Our Hybrid market segment declined about 10% with Food & Beverage and Life Sciences performing in line with our expectations. Food & Beverage customers continued to experience extremely high demand and as a result, we are helping them focus their resources on maximizing production. These customers continue to show strong interest in digital transformation solutions that will improve their resiliency and flexibility. Although timing around these projects has been delayed as a result of the pandemic, we would expect Food & Beverage to begin to improve over the coming months. One meaningful indicator for the Food & Beverage vertical continues to come from Packaging OEMs, which showed positive growth in the quarter. Turning to Life Sciences. We continue to expect Life Sciences to have a strong finish to the year, due to the industry\u2019s strong focus on digital transformation, as well as our involvement with the leading companies making significant investments in COVID-related vaccines and treatments. Process markets were down approximately 25% with Oil & Gas a little weaker. In general, process markets are more solutions-based and require more hands-on interaction, both at the front-end of a new project as well as at the back-end for final commissioning and delivery. We saw physical restrictions and continuing lack of access to plants due to COVID having a more significant impact on these industries. Turning now to Slide 5, and our organic regional sales performance in the quarter. North America declined by 20% with weaker process industries partly offset by better resiliency in discrete and hybrid industry segments. In this region, product sales performed better than our solutions and services. EMEA sales outperformed our expectations and benefited from PPE production and double-digit growth in Information Solutions and Connected Services. Asia Pacific sales declined 10% with year-over-year positive growth in Automotive and Semiconductor. China sales declined mid-single digits, but saw orders return to positive growth in the quarter. Broad-based Latin America declines were led by very weak Automotive performance. Turning now to our outlook on Slide 6. Last quarter, we forecasted that our fiscal third quarter sales would be down approximately 20% followed by sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. We came in slightly better than that in Q3, and our mix of product was also more favorable. However, the rate of recovery in our solutions and services business is slower than we anticipated, due to the continued restricted movement of people. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic, and global efforts to respond to it, are rapidly evolving. Our projections assume that a gradual recovery continues, with no increase in pandemic-related facility closures or disruptions to the supply chain. Based on all the information we have available at this time, we expect organic sales to decline approximately 8% for the fiscal year. No change from our prior full year guidance midpoint. We expect inorganic investments to contribute about four points of growth to the year, and adjusted EPS to reach $7.50 at the midpoint. That\u2019s up from the guidance midpoint of $7.30 we set in April. We continue to target free cash flow conversion at over 100%. With that, let me now turn it over to Patrick who will elaborate on our third quarter financial performance and fiscal 2020 outlook in his remarks. Patrick?\nPatrick Goris: Thank you, Blake, and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll start on Slide 8, third quarter key financial information. For the third quarter, organic sales were down 17.6% compared to last year, and acquisitions contributed just over 3% to total growth. Currency translation was a larger headwind than expected due to a stronger U.S. dollar, and decreased sales by 1.9 points. Orders performed better than sales, and were down mid-teens year-over-year. Overall, company backlog increased year-over-year for the quarter. Segment operating margin was 16.5%, down 730 basis points compared to last year\u2019s record high, primarily due to lower sales. General corporate net expense is up slightly compared to last year, mainly as a result of unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments related to our deferred and non-qualified compensation plans. Adjusted EPS of $1.27 was better than expected. During April\u2019s call, I mentioned that we expected adjusted EPS to be a bit over $1, based on an organic sales decline of about 20%. Organic sales performance at minus 17.6% was better than expected, as was product mix, and discrete tax items were about a $0.05 benefit to our results in the quarter. Our results include about $15 million or $0.10 of adjusted EPS of restructuring charges, which are offset by a gain on an asset sale. From an operating earnings perspective, both items are evenly split between the two segments. On the statement of operations on page ten of our press release, the gain on sale is included in other income and the restructuring charges are included in SG&A. You will note that SG&A is up about $9 million year-over-year, reflecting not only the restructuring charges, but also the incremental SG&A from acquisitions made this fiscal year. The combined impact of these two items is a year-over-year increase of over $30 million in SG&A expense. I\u2019ll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter of 13.5% was lower than we expected, due to a benefit from option exercises. Free cash flow in the quarter of $311 million was a strong result in this environment, with over 200% conversion on adjusted income \u2013 further enhancing our liquidity. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our operating segments. I will just point out that the main driver of segment margin reduction is lower sales. The book-to-bill for our solutions and services businesses was 1.05 for Q3, with continued project delays impacting these businesses rather than project cancellations. The next slide, 10, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q3 fiscal 2019 to Q3 fiscal 2020. As you can see, core performance was down significantly on the large organic revenue decline in the quarter. Our temporary cost reduction actions, and a lower tax rate, partially mitigated the impact of the large sales decline. The restructuring charge and the gain on the asset sale pretty much offset each other. The Adjusted EPS impact of acquisitions was about $0.05 dilutive, including intangible amortization. Core earnings conversion in the quarter, that is, excluding the effects of acquisitions and currency, was about 50% roughly in line with the outlook comments that I shared with you in April. Before I move on, I want to mention that we continue to be in a strong position regarding our capital structure and liquidity. At June 30, cash on the balance sheet was over $900 million, and our total debt was about $2.4 billion. You can find a current update of our balance sheet and liquidity slide in the appendix. Moving to slide 11, product order trends. This slide shows our global daily order trends for our product businesses. Our product businesses represent about two-thirds of our overall sales, and include our shorter-cycle, book and bill businesses. Within the quarter, daily product orders troughed in April followed by sequential improvement in May, June, and continuing into July through Friday of last week. Our updated guidance assumes this improving trend continues at a gradual pace. Moving to slide 12. I\u2019ll provide a brief update on a few things that we discussed on our last earnings call with respect to COVID-19. Our first priority remains employee and customer safety. Access to customer sites improved throughout the third quarter, but remains a challenge for our solutions and services businesses. This affects not only our utilization rates and creates associated inefficiencies, but also project timing. We continue to experience project delays in our solutions and services businesses, and the rate of improvement is slower than we expected in April. We are however not seeing a pickup in cancellations, just project pushouts. Regarding our own manufacturing operations and supply chain, our plants continue to be operational and meet current demand. Supply disruptions have generally been mitigated, but we continue to incur higher freight costs and inefficiencies in our operations as we focus on the safety and well-being of our employees. During the quarter, we approved incremental investments to increase the resiliency of our supply chain and operations. For example, we\u2019re in the process of making investments to provide us more flexibility to produce products in multiple locations around the world. This includes capital investments in some of our U.S. facilities. Finally, the temporary cost actions we implemented during Q3 remain in place. The temporary cost actions and absence of a bonus earned are tailwinds for us in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. As these items are reversed, they will present a headwind for fiscal 2021. We intend to neutralize that headwind through the structural cost actions we have taken this year, additional cost savings identified, and by maintaining lower levels of discretionary spending. Let\u2019s move on to the next slide, 13, Updated Guidance. We now expect full year fiscal 2020 reported sales to be down approximately 5.5%. We continue to project organic sales to be down about 8% compared to last year. Segment margin is still expected to be about 19.5%. The lower adjusted effective tax rate mainly reflects the discrete items we benefited from in the third quarter. Our updated adjusted EPS guidance range is $7.40 to $7.60. At the midpoint, this is $0.20 higher than prior guidance, reflecting our third quarter performance and a lower tax rate for the full year. On a year-over-year basis, our guidance at the midpoint assumes full-year core earnings conversion, which excludes the impacts of currency and acquisitions, of about 35%. General corporate net is still expected to be about $95 million. Purchase accounting amortization expense for the full year is expected to be about $40 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2020 is still expected to amount to about $100 million. We expect non-controlling-interest to be slightly positive, given lower earnings at Sensia. We expect continued strong free cash flow performance, with free cash conversion of over 100% of adjusted income. Finally, with respect to repurchases, we spent about $50 million in the third quarter. Our guidance does not assume any additional share repurchases for the remainder of fiscal 2020. Average fully diluted share count is now expected to be 116.6 million for fiscal 2020. Our capital deployment priorities remain the same. Our first priority is organic growth. After that, we focus capital deployment on inorganic activities. Then, we focus on capital returns to shareowners, through our dividend and then share repurchases. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you Blake to for some additional remarks before we start Q&A.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Patrick. Let\u2019s turn now to slide 14. While the pandemic has disrupted our normal course of business in the short-term, we believe it is also accelerating the need for industrial automation and digital transformation solutions that address manufacturing safety, as well as operational flexibility and resiliency. To better align us with the evolving needs of our customers, we are very excited to announce our three new operating segments, simplifying our structure around essential offerings, leveraging our sharpened industry focus, and adding software talent, which will play a larger role in our future value. This is the next step toward accelerating the profitable growth strategy that we discussed last year at Investor Day. It is also no coincidence that these operating segments map very closely to how our customers think about technology. If you recall, this is a similar technology stack to the one we reviewed at Investor Day last November. To begin with, the products included in our Intelligent Devices segment are every bit as important as they have always been. Intelligent Devices are the inputs and outputs for industrial processes, and they are also where the data is born. Moving up, control is at the heart of automation, and customers continue to demand high reliability and safety in their processes. We also see the growing role software can play to increase flexibility and insight across global customer operations. We\u2019re focusing on these crucial, integrated capabilities, and adding additional talent in our new software and control segment. And finally, the domain expertise provided by our lifecycle services ensures the positive business outcomes that give our customers a faster return on their automation investment. The three segments will continue to share a common sales organization and supply chain. Having a single sales force, knowledgeable in their customer\u2019s applications, simplifies the way customers interact with us. This is just one way in which simplification delivers efficiencies for both us and our customers. Our leadership will continue to blend experienced Rockwell leaders with fresh perspectives. Fran Wlodarczyk will lead the Intelligent Devices segment; Frank Kulaszewicz will lead the Lifecycle Services segment, and we will begin an external search for the leader of Software & Control. In the interim, Chris Nardecchia, our current Senior Vice President of Information Technology and Chief Information Officer, will serve as the leader for that segment. In addition, to accelerate the evolution of our culture, Becky House has become Chief Administrative and Legal Officer, which includes leadership of our talent, legal, ethics and compliance, and Environmental, Health & Safety teams. Our culture is the foundation for accelerated growth under this new structure. It reflects a willingness to compare ourselves to the best alternatives our stakeholders have; a focus on increasing the speed of decision-making; ensuring we have a steady stream of fresh ideas; and, of course, our strong culture of integrity and inclusion. A more detailed view of what is included in each segment can be found on slide 15. Turning to slide 16. These segments create clear focus for each of these essential offerings, and they all have plenty of room to gain share and profitably accelerate our growth in expanding markets. This new structure positions us well to deliver value to customers in what is being called the new normal. Turning to slide 17, I\u2019ll make some additional comments on the secular changes we\u2019re seeing in our market. As you may recall, last quarter, we talked about the increasing need for customers to build resiliency and flexibility in their operations and supply chains. That includes the need for life sciences companies to increase their local manufacturing capability for medicines and medical devices in the U.S.; and the need for innovative technologies to drive higher levels of productivity, flexibility, sustainability, traceability, and safety. In the last three months, we have seen examples of all of these trends. Many life sciences companies recently announced they are in the process of expanding their North American manufacturing footprints and supply chains, and other companies in discrete industries are planning to do the same. In the quarter, we also won business with Johnson & Johnson to deliver technology for their new Universal Machine, which represents the epitome of flexible manufacturing. The Universal Machine is a collaborative, mobile robot that will be deployed in response to the COVID-19 crisis, and can be repurposed to do machine loading and unloading, end of line packaging and inspection activities, or warehouse material handling activities where social distancing is needed. We think many companies will be interested in adding this type of flexible automation technology to their manufacturing environments in the future. And evidence continues to build for the need for more remote capabilities. In the quarter, we had a key win in EMEA with a major oil company that is making investments in Sensia technology to significantly increase their remote monitoring capabilities. In addition to our remote monitoring capabilities, the value of our augmented reality offering with PTC is very compelling to customers as they increasingly look for alternative ways to operate their plants efficiently and safely, and to re-skill their workers as quickly as possible. These trends are unfolding now, and as you can see from many of the offerings on this slide, we are well aligned to customers\u2019 needs as they manage through this new normal. Nobody is better positioned to bring information technology and industrial operational technology together than Rockwell and our partners. Our customers\u2019 efforts to increase resilience and agility have the potential to provide meaningful tailwinds for years to come. With that, let me pass the baton back to Jessica to begin the Q&A session.\nA - Jessica Kourakos: Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible. So, please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Lisa, let\u2019s take our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius. Your line is open.\nScott Davis: Good morning, guys.\nPatrick Goris: Good morning, Scott.\nBlake Moret: Good morning.\nScott Davis: Good morning. I like these new segments. This seems simpler. But anyways, can you help us understand the margin, maybe perhaps some margin differences between the three?\nPatrick Goris: Yes, Scott. Good morning. Patrick, here. We\u2019re still fine-tuning this a little bit and operationalizing the changes, of course. But preliminary estimates based on fiscal 2019 results, and the numbers I\u2019m going to give you is, give or take, a few points in each the direction. Think of Intelligent Devices as being about 20%, Software & Control about 30%, and Lifecycle Service is about 15%. And so roughly, these are based on fiscal 2019, the segment margins. And I would add to that, Scott, that \u2013 and it may be very helpful for you guys is we do not intend to change our definition of segment operating earnings.\nScott Davis: Super helpful, okay. And just as a follow-on, I can\u2019t remember you guys doing an external search for a operating role before. Did I hear you correctly, Blake? Blake? That you\u2019re doing to do an external search for Software & Control? Maybe some color around what you\u2019re looking for there.\nBlake Moret: Sure. I mean, we\u2019ve talked about our culture as involving a steady stream of new ideas. And bringing those new ideas into the organization comes from unlocking that innovation from our existing talent in the organization. It comes from acquisitions, and it comes from hiring at different levels of the organization as well. And we\u2019ve got great existing leadership in the company, but there\u2019s always good ideas that we can incorporate from the outside. And so as we launch this new segment of Software & Control, we do expect to bring those perspectives in with the leader of that segment.\nScott Davis: Okay. Good luck to you, guys. Thank you.\nPatrick Goris: Yes. Thanks, Scott.\nBlake Moret: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.\nJohn Inch: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I\u2019m wondering if we could talk about the sales or credit risks with, say, smaller oil and gas operators or EV start ups? And in that context, could you also talk about your auto industry project outlook?\nPatrick Goris: Yes, John. Patrick here.\nJohn Inch: Good morning.\nPatrick Goris: From a probably a receivable risk or credit and collection risk, we would actually say that in the last quarter overall, our overall, call it, the current receivable percent actually slightly improved. And so I\u2019d say that doesn\u2019t mean that there are some \u2013 one these twosies, where we may have some challenges. We always have that. But I\u2019d say our overall portfolio has actually improved in the last quarter.\nBlake Moret: Yes. I would also add to that, John. And from an EV standpoint, we watch closely. We recognize that the rush to add electric vehicle portfolios from big and small companies is new. And not all of those start-ups are going to survive. So, we manage that closely. I should also add, because so much of our business goes through distribution, we\u2019re keeping very close to our distributors during this time so that we\u2019re in constant communication to make sure that we understand what they\u2019re going through. And so that\u2019s an important part of our day-to-day operational activities, both in terms of the direct project business as well as the flow business through distribution.\nJohn Inch: All right. And then the auto industry project outlook? How are you guys thinking about that heading into sort of second half of this year and next year? The parts of EV versus traditional, whatever you like.\nBlake Moret: Sure. I think from an electric vehicle standpoint, a lot of these companies, whether they\u2019re big established companies that have divisions devoted to EV or they\u2019re start-ups, they have to bring a portfolio of vehicles to market to get a return on all that investment. And while those projects, in some cases, have been delayed, we\u2019ve seen very little in the way of cancellations there. And I think that\u2019s probably a general view of the automotive industry in that we did see MRO a little bit better than our expectations in the quarter. It was low, but it was better than we feared. And projects continue to move, although at a slower pace.\nJohn Inch: That\u2019s helpful. And then just lastly, could we put a frame around the restructuring and cost out actions. So I think, if we go back to last quarter, there was $150 million \u2013 I think you said the phraseology was \u201cmostly temporary.\u201d How much did you get out of the quarter? And I apologize if you said that, how much more is to come? And then I saw there were some restructuring charges. Maybe you could talk about kind of what those actions do for you in 2020 and what the setup is kind of on that basis for 2021? And obviously, are you contemplating even more restructuring or footprint realignment or stuff that could be more of a permanent nature, I think, like you did mention or maybe, Patrick, you mentioned you were going to try and offset, right, the temporary actions with other sort of measures. Maybe we could just sort of flesh that out a little bit. Thank you.\nPatrick Goris: Yes, John. So, in April, we mentioned that we implemented cost reductions that would yield over $150 million in year-over-year savings. That included a significant amount from temporary actions related to not having a bonus this year, but also some of the temporary pay cuts we implemented. We are achieving the savings we targeted. The temporary actions remain in place. As we undo dose temporary actions in fiscal 2021, they provide a headwind. That headwind, based on, as Blake mentioned in his comments, on doing the pay cuts at the end of the calendar year, that headwind is a little north of $130 million. We intend to neutralize that through: one, structural cost actions we\u2019ve taken in September last year with some carryover, but also the cost actions that we\u2019ve announced today. Those combined are expected to yield over $40 million of incremental savings in fiscal 2021. We\u2019ve identified additional cost savings that are a little over $50 million. And then finally, we expect to maintain lower levels of discretionary spend going forward. Maybe a little bit more color on the additional cost savings that I talked about. That includes permanent elimination of some open positions. In fiscal 2020, we have some one-time costs and inefficiencies related to the pandemic or even acquisitions, and we\u2019re in the process of reducing our real estate footprint globally. And so a lot of moving pieces there, but it is our intention to neutralize the reversal of temporary actions in fiscal 2021 through these cost actions.\nJohn Inch: Got it, very helpful. Thanks, everyone. Good luck.\nPatrick Goris: Thank you, John.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning.\nPatrick Goris: Hi, Julian.\nJulian Mitchell: Hey, maybe, just a first question on the top line point. If you could clarify what the solutions and services orders did year-on-year? Sorry, if I missed that. And also if the cadence of those incoming orders has broadly matched the slight improvement you\u2019re seeing month-on-month on the product side or whether the order intake is lagging to what you\u2019re seeing on the product improvement?\nBlake Moret: Yes. So, on the solutions and services, year-over-year, I would just say that our book-to-bill was 1.05 and that we built backlog in the quarter. And that our backlog is up year-over-year for our solutions and services as well. And I think that provides you some indication there. In terms of timing of orders for solutions and services, I think looking at that by week or by month is not always as helpful as it is for our flow business, our product businesses. And so I don\u2019t think that providing that by month would be very helpful. What we have seen is some project pushouts. But as more and more customers have opened up, we\u2019ve seen our services folks being called back into customer locations, and we\u2019ve seen our solutions people being able to enter some of our customer facilities as well. And so there is an improvement sequentially there.\nPatrick Goris: I would also add Julian, that the solutions and services orders and shipments are probably a little more subject to calendarization within the quarter to our products and that orders tend to come in later in the month and the last month of the quarter for both orders and shipments is typically stronger. So, it\u2019s a little more sensitive to which month you\u2019re in than the product flow.\nJulian Mitchell: Thank you. And then my second question on the margins, just wanted to clarify that the segment margin guide for the year, that does embed a narrower decremental margin in the fourth quarter than what you saw in Q3. Maybe just help us understand what drives that? And also, if you could clarify the investment spend, what that is doing in the second half of the year? Thank you.\nPatrick Goris: Yes. So, investment spend for the second half of the year is about down, about 6% year-over-year. Basically the same as what I shared with you last quarter. In terms of Q4 decrementals, they will be better. And so we expect our core decrementals to be in the mid-20s in Q4 and the main reason for that is that we get a bigger benefit from the temporary cost actions. We get three months rather than two months and in the fourth quarter compared to the last year, we have about a $30 million benefit as well from lower incentive compensation expense. So, higher run rate of the cost actions we have taken and also a bigger tailwind for lower incentive compensation in the fourth quarter.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nPatrick Goris: Thank you, Julian.\nBlake Moret: Thank you, Julian.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague, your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: I\u2019m sorry, good day everyone. Just a little more color if we could on kind of the trajectory here as we exited the quarter. This progression you showed on Slide 11, can you just give us some sense on June and July versus kind of prior year levels? What those order trends look like?\nPatrick Goris: The order transfer, they were still down significantly versus the prior year for both June and July. And so we \u2013 the worst performance year-over-year from an order perspective was in April. We\u2019ve improved sequentially since, but they\u2019re still down in the mid-teens for both June. And we\u2019re, I would say, gradually improving sequentially and as well as the year-over-year delta is becoming smaller.\nJeff Sprague: You said the quarter was down mid-teens. June was also down mid-teens basically, sounds like. Could we dig a little further in the\u2026\nPatrick Goris: April was the worst from a year-over-year perspective. And the subsequent months were a little bit better from a year-over-year perspective on the order intake.\nJeff Sprague: All right. Thanks for that clarification. On the food and beverage side, can you elaborate a little bit more what you\u2019re seeing? We\u2019ve seen a reduction in SKUs and things like this as retailers try to push them out and more going through e-commerce and the like. It sounds like that is at least a temporary headwind on the business. How do you see that playing out?\nBlake Moret: Yes. A couple of things and let me just circle back, Jeff, to put a finer point on Patrick\u2019s comments. The order development that we\u2019ve seen over the last few months is consistent with that idea of a gradual recovery. So, as we look at that year-over-year and sequentially, a gradual recovery is what we continue to see through month-to-date in July. From a food and beverage standpoint, the basic issue is that these companies, given are weighting more heavily towards prepackaged food that goes to the grocery store or directly to the home, they\u2019re running full out. And so most of our efforts and theirs are devoted to maintaining production at really high levels. We\u2019re seeing a continued demand for flexibility. In this case, the food producers are moving quickly to be able to change their packaging formats to be able to meet what\u2019s being bought today. And in many cases, people who were eating at home much more than they ever have. We think that long term, the trend towards additional flexibility will only become greater. People are going to continue to want a variety of packaging formats, and we really haven\u2019t seen an overall SKU reduction across the industry. The mantra of the packaging machine OEMs driven by the end-user demand is getting to zero change over time, to go from one packaging format to the next, and we haven\u2019t seen any reduction in the focus in that area, which requires a lot of automation.\nJeff Sprague: All right. Thank you for that. I\u2019ll pass for now.\nBlake Moret: Thank you, Jeff.\nPatrick Goris: Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning, guys.\nBlake Moret: Good morning.\nPatrick Goris: Good morning, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Blake, you just talked about the pandemic potentially accelerating the need for resilience and flexibility of your customers, especially in Life Sciences. Can you give us more color or at all quantify maybe what you would call the pandemic response orders you\u2019re seeing to help avoid single points of failure, increased resiliency and then stepping \u2013 do you think your primary markets can recover even in a CapEx constrained environment as customers focus on productivity through automation? Or is it really still too early to tell?\nBlake Moret: Well, I think our primary industries and the areas within those industries that we\u2019re putting particular focus do have good long-term growth prospects. When you talk \u2013 you mentioned Life Sciences, and people are going to continue even after we get past this current environment. People are going to want to live longer, healthier lives and so Life Sciences is going to be a continued area of focus for us. Food and beverage, for obvious reasons, they\u2019re going to continue \u2013 it\u2019s going to continue to be important. I think the trend towards electric vehicles, increasing. And even in the worst of the lockdowns, the world was still consuming 60 million or 70 million barrels of oil a day. And so the desire to produce that oil as efficiently as possible is in line with what we\u2019re doing. In terms of the quantification on our results, it\u2019s going to be varied by industry. And I\u2019ve talked before about how I think we\u2019re going to see the movement probably most pronounced in the discrete and the hybrid industries, where you\u2019re not as tied to the resource itself sitting in the ground, whether it\u2019s mining or oil and gas or what have you. So far, the orders that we\u2019ve seen that I would call are incremental come from machinery builders in Europe, comes from life sciences companies in the U.S. We\u2019ve talked a little bit about that. And so I think it\u2019s going to be gradual, but these are longer-term trends. And we also look at ourselves and what investments we\u2019re making to increase resiliency. And as Patrick said, we are making some capital investments in the U.S. to increase resiliency. In our case, it\u2019s to build some of our high-value products in more than one place. And I think when we have those ideas and a lot of our customers are thinking about it like us, then it\u2019s fair as soon that they\u2019ve got similar plans.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Blake, just a follow-up on that. So discrete has historically been a very cyclical part of your business, especially during recession. But it may be down only mid-single digits in FY 2020, as you talked about, despite auto markets globally being difficult. So, we know it\u2019s a combination of your technology, helping you in auto, focus on EV, semicon has held up. But do you see this level of discrete outperformance and sort of market share gains continuing or even accelerating going into 2021?\nBlake Moret: Well, we certainly intend to continue to gain share. I think it\u2019s not only picking the applications such as EV within the broader verticals, but it\u2019s also the mix of what we\u2019re offering as well. And we\u2019ve talked a lot about recurring revenue in terms of software and high-value services and then a maybe better balance across the industries as well. So, we talked before about how this year, automotive will be less than 10% of our business, it\u2019s very valuable. And we expect that business to grow profitably for us over time. But I like that we\u2019re serving a host of industries that have great long-term prospects. And so we do intend to gain share across a broad front.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Thanks, Blake.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning, all.\nBlake Moret: Hey, Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Just a first question, I guess for Patrick. I appreciate the color on kind of offsetting or neutralizing some of the push and pull on the cost front for next year. Presumably, there\u2019s a growth level which that starts to tip more toward investment. Any historical context that you could give us around, hey, once we get past mid single-digit growth, we really start to feed the machine. Or any way we should think about kind of that sensitivity of being able to restrain investment?\nPatrick Goris: Yes. I think the way you can think about it, Josh, is that going back to our framework of our objective to deliver mid-single digits of organic growth, 30% to 35% earnings conversion. And so the level of growth will determine how much more we intend to invest, but I can\u2019t give you a certain percent that says this will be a trigger to invest more than we otherwise would. But that long-term framework of 30% to 35% earnings conversion at mid-single digits, it\u2019s something that over a longer period of time we intend to adhere to.\nBlake Moret: Yes. Josh, I can add to that. Even with the restructuring that we announced, a significant portion of that frees up resource for reinvestment. It\u2019s not just about the cost savings year-over-year, but it\u2019s to focus resources well in the areas that we think are going to be particularly important and in the organizational changes. The primary purpose of that is to accelerate profitable growth. We\u2019re looking for efficiencies, and we expect we\u2019ll find some, but the primary purpose is to accelerate profitable growth.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow-up. And Blake, I appreciate all the commentary on growth opportunities with near shoring. I guess another market that seeming to catch fire here is the warehouse automation market. And I know you have some content there, some exposure. It\u2019s fairly small. Is there either a product or a channel or a partner barrier there where that\u2019s not been larger? Because I think you\u2019ve seen some pretty frothy order numbers from folks in that space. It doesn\u2019t seem to have been a historical needle mover for you guys. So any commentary there on either investment or legacy barriers that have kept that from being bigger? Thanks.\nBlake Moret: Yes. It\u2019s a great part of the market for us. Traditionally, for a long time, we\u2019ve had a very good fit with the products when you think about the material handling and sortation. I think we\u2019ve added some products that have spurred some of the recent opportunities and wins that we\u2019ve seen. Independent cart is one area, so very high-precision motion control is needed even more than ever, the traceability that\u2019s used in their software systems. And so I don\u2019t see it as being constrained by products for the automation or channel. We\u2019re close to a lot of the key suppliers in the area. But we are, to your point, looking at ways as to how we can develop that even more because that\u2019s one of those long-term trends that we continue to expect to benefit from.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Great. Thanks, Blake.\nBlake Moret: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nNigel Coe: Yes. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Maybe just asking Josh\u2019s question, first question in a slightly different way. You mentioned, I think, Blake, that you hope to maybe roll back some of these temporary cost measures before December. I guess, what would be the catalyst for you to do that? Do we need to see, I don\u2019t know, sales stabilizing or sales on a clear path back towards growth. I mean, what are you looking for to kind of ease back on those salary and benefit reductions?\nBlake Moret: Yes. I think we continue to expect a gradual recovery in orders and sales. But at the heart of it is the infection rates and to look at how the countries in which we operate in get the spread of infection under control. I think that\u2019s really the fundamental pacing item as that improves. Then we have a much more positive outlook. I would also say that, as I did say in my earlier remarks, there\u2019s a limit to how long we can keep those temporary reductions in place. And at some point, we would have to substitute more structural reductions for the pay reductions, because we can\u2019t go on past a certain amount of time with those temporary reductions affecting our entire workforce.\nNigel Coe: Great. Thanks, Blake, that\u2019s great. And then the problem of given more disclosure is there\u2019s \u2013 the month that you have more disclosure. On the monthly product orders, July versus June, normally, I\u2019d expect July to be weaker than June sequentially. And obviously, July is slightly better than June. How does that look for Rockwell from a normal seasonal pattern? Would you normally see July versus June similar? Or would there be a slight step back? And I recognize that your sales are normally stronger in 4Q fiscal versus 3Q fiscal. Just wondering how normally that order pattern would look in a normal year, recognizing that there aren\u2019t too many normal years?\nPatrick Goris: Yes, Nigel, Patrick here. So actually for our product order intake, July tends to be somewhat similar than June historically. And so what we\u2019re seeing now is somewhat typical. On the sales side, normally, the first month after the end of the quarter is a little bit weaker than the prior. And so I would say \u2013 go ahead, Nigel?\nNigel Coe: It feels like we\u2019re recoupling back to some semblance of normal seasonality into July at this point?\nPatrick Goris: It is still early in July, but what we\u2019ve seen so far is not untypical. And of course, our guidance assumes that we\u2019ll see continued improving trends sequentially.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Thanks, Patrick. Thanks, Blake.\nPatrick Goris: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Your line is open. Andrew Obin, your line is open.\nJessica Kourakos: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJoe Ritchie: Great. Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nPatrick Goris: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey, Blake, when we caught up intra-quarter, you had referenced the life science customers and again, made reference to the fact that it seems like things are moving forward in that regard. Can you give us a sense on timing on when they\u2019ll actually make a decision to really improve \u2013 whether it\u2019s reshoring or capital investment, to basically improve their supply chain? Just any thoughts around timing around that those awards?\nBlake Moret: Joe, you\u2019re talking specifically about Life Sciences customers?\nJoe Ritchie: Yes, specifically around the Life Sciences customers.\nBlake Moret: Yes. I mean, we\u2019re seeing plans, particularly for those who were developing therapeutics and vaccine candidates. So we\u2019re seeing them either directly or through their contract manufacturers in the middle of plans to ramp that up now. Now that\u2019s not the entire market. But what is common across the entire life sciences market is the accelerated interest in digital transformation. They know that they\u2019re not going to be able to get to scale without the basic automation and the ability to schedule product manufacturing and so on, driven by software. So we\u2019re definitely seeing those plans increase. They\u2019ve got a little bit of the situation that food and beverage does in that many of them are already just trying to ramp up production with their existing assets. But I think we\u2019re going to see that over time. I don\u2019t expect it to be a step change, but we\u2019re definitely seeing the slope with the current increase with respect to Life Sciences customers.\nJoe Ritchie: That\u2019s helpful to hear. I guess maybe my one follow-up and just the flip side to that question is, you guys called out the process business. Basically your guidance being worse now versus where it was in April and I don\u2019t think that probably comes as much of a surprise to many people. But I\u2019m just curious, as you kind of think about the process business longer term and given where oil prices are today, and also the investments that you\u2019ve made within Sensia, like how are you thinking about this business with respect to the portfolio, just from a longer-term growth perspective? And how long is it going to take to kind of get back to some decent growth in the business?\nBlake Moret: Yes. There\u2019s no question that the oil and gas business is under a lot of pressure right now. But Sensia\u2019s positioned exactly where I would want it to be positioned, and that is focused on operational efficiencies and decreasing the breakeven point to produce a barrel of oil and I think there\u2019s some evidence that, that is where the market is investing and that orders for Sensia were actually a little bit better than our expectations in the quarter. So it\u2019s a tough spot for oil and gas, but helping them produce more efficiently is right where I want to be.\nJoe Ritchie: That\u2019s interesting comments on the order side. Thank you for that.\nBlake Moret: Yes. Thanks, Joe.\nJessica Kourakos: Thank you very much everyone. I\u2019ll turn it back to Blake for a few final comments.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Jessica. To summarize, we remain focused on the well-being of our employees, we\u2019re managing prudently through a gradual recovery, and we are taking steps to accelerate long- term profitable growth. Nobody is better positioned to bring information technology and industrial operational technology together than Rockwell and our partners, and we wish you all good health, and thank you for your interest and support.\nJessica Kourakos: That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you all for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you for joining. That concludes today\u2019s conference call. At this time, you may disconnect. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Blake Moret",
            "content": "Thanks, Jessica, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Before we begin discussing our results and outlook, I'd like to make just a few opening remarks. While we, as a company, are managing well in this environment, we are highly sensitive to the toll this is taking on our employees during this time. Beyond the fear of a loved one getting sick, racial injustice is on our minds as we develop actions as a company, and as individuals, that will help put a permanent end to the denial of fundamental human rights. Additionally, thousands of our employees continue to work under very difficult conditions, including the temporary pay cuts we implemented in May. These pay cuts were necessary to better align our costs to current business conditions while preserving jobs, but there is a limit to how long they can remain in place. I hope we would be in a position to announce a firm end-date to the temporary pay reductions by now, since our goal has always been to reverse them as soon as possible. However, business conditions remain weak and the recent surge of COVID-19 infections has worried all of us, and nobody can predict with accuracy when a combination of social distancing practices, therapeutic medicines, and eventual vaccines will turn the tide. We do intend to reverse the temporary pay reductions by the end of December and hopefully sooner. In addition, this quarter we will make another special payment to our manufacturing associates worldwide, who are on the front lines of maintaining our essential operations. There are many reasons to be optimistic, and I am immensely proud of all of our employees and the great work they are doing. Our Environmental, Health, and Safety team is working around the clock to keep employees safe, and our technology is crucial to projects that are increasing mask and respirator production to far higher levels than four months ago. Candidate therapeutics and vaccines are being produced and packaged with the help of our innovation and expertise around the world. In short, our employees are having a direct impact on protecting the health of millions of people around the world, and I want to thank them all for their dedication. Turning now to our results on Slide 3. While business conditions remain difficult, and results in Q3 were down year-over-year, earnings were higher than we expected for the quarter, primarily driven by better organic sales. Total sales declined by 16% versus the prior year, including a three-point contribution from inorganic investments. Organic sales were down about 17.5%, and better than the 20% decline we were expecting heading into the quarter. Product sales outperformed our expectations, and were driven by better performance in Logix, Motion and Network and Security Infrastructure. We also had a number of new strategic wins in process applications against major process competitors. These wins spanned several industries this quarter, including Life Sciences, Food & Beverage and Oil & Gas. One of the more notable wins was with Companhia Cacique de Cafe\u0301 Soluvel, the largest exporter of instant coffee in Brazil and one of the largest in the world. They are building a new, technologically advanced coffee plant to expand production capacity. This was a highly competitive greenfield win, and we beat our biggest competitors based on our technology and track record with the customer. This win includes a broad suite of Rockwell technology: FactoryTalk Innovation Suite software, drives, Connected Services, as well as newly-released process control technology within Logix that enhances our differentiation against traditional DCS systems. Turning to Information Solutions and Connected Services. Sales were down slightly, partly due to travel restrictions and limited access to customer sites. However, IS/CS orders grew double digits over the prior year and showed strong growth in both software as well as connected services. Turning now to earnings. Adjusted EPS was $1.27, and our strong cash flow performance further reinforces our already-strong balance sheet and liquidity position. Let's now turn to Slide 4, where I will provide a few highlights of our Q3 organic end-market performance. Our Discrete market segment declined approximately 20% with Automotive performing better than we projected in April, based on the factory closures at that time. Semiconductor saw positive growth in the quarter, up mid-single digits, and continues to benefit from secular tailwinds in 5G, datacenters, and the Internet of Things. We also see ecommerce as an important emerging driver of our discrete business, due to the excellent fit of our technology with fulfillment center applications. Our Hybrid market segment declined about 10% with Food & Beverage and Life Sciences performing in line with our expectations. Food & Beverage customers continued to experience extremely high demand and as a result, we are helping them focus their resources on maximizing production. These customers continue to show strong interest in digital transformation solutions that will improve their resiliency and flexibility. Although timing around these projects has been delayed as a result of the pandemic, we would expect Food & Beverage to begin to improve over the coming months. One meaningful indicator for the Food & Beverage vertical continues to come from Packaging OEMs, which showed positive growth in the quarter. Turning to Life Sciences. We continue to expect Life Sciences to have a strong finish to the year, due to the industry's strong focus on digital transformation, as well as our involvement with the leading companies making significant investments in COVID-related vaccines and treatments. Process markets were down approximately 25% with Oil & Gas a little weaker. In general, process markets are more solutions-based and require more hands-on interaction, both at the front-end of a new project as well as at the back-end for final commissioning and delivery. We saw physical restrictions and continuing lack of access to plants due to COVID having a more significant impact on these industries. Turning now to Slide 5, and our organic regional sales performance in the quarter. North America declined by 20% with weaker process industries partly offset by better resiliency in discrete and hybrid industry segments. In this region, product sales performed better than our solutions and services. EMEA sales outperformed our expectations and benefited from PPE production and double-digit growth in Information Solutions and Connected Services. Asia Pacific sales declined 10% with year-over-year positive growth in Automotive and Semiconductor. China sales declined mid-single digits, but saw orders return to positive growth in the quarter. Broad-based Latin America declines were led by very weak Automotive performance. Turning now to our outlook on Slide 6. Last quarter, we forecasted that our fiscal third quarter sales would be down approximately 20% followed by sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. We came in slightly better than that in Q3, and our mix of product was also more favorable. However, the rate of recovery in our solutions and services business is slower than we anticipated, due to the continued restricted movement of people. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic, and global efforts to respond to it, are rapidly evolving. Our projections assume that a gradual recovery continues, with no increase in pandemic-related facility closures or disruptions to the supply chain. Based on all the information we have available at this time, we expect organic sales to decline approximately 8% for the fiscal year. No change from our prior full year guidance midpoint. We expect inorganic investments to contribute about four points of growth to the year, and adjusted EPS to reach $7.50 at the midpoint. That's up from the guidance midpoint of $7.30 we set in April. We continue to target free cash flow conversion at over 100%. With that, let me now turn it over to Patrick who will elaborate on our third quarter financial performance and fiscal 2020 outlook in his remarks. Patrick? Thanks, Patrick. Let's turn now to slide 14. While the pandemic has disrupted our normal course of business in the short-term, we believe it is also accelerating the need for industrial automation and digital transformation solutions that address manufacturing safety, as well as operational flexibility and resiliency. To better align us with the evolving needs of our customers, we are very excited to announce our three new operating segments, simplifying our structure around essential offerings, leveraging our sharpened industry focus, and adding software talent, which will play a larger role in our future value. This is the next step toward accelerating the profitable growth strategy that we discussed last year at Investor Day. It is also no coincidence that these operating segments map very closely to how our customers think about technology. If you recall, this is a similar technology stack to the one we reviewed at Investor Day last November. To begin with, the products included in our Intelligent Devices segment are every bit as important as they have always been. Intelligent Devices are the inputs and outputs for industrial processes, and they are also where the data is born. Moving up, control is at the heart of automation, and customers continue to demand high reliability and safety in their processes. We also see the growing role software can play to increase flexibility and insight across global customer operations. We're focusing on these crucial, integrated capabilities, and adding additional talent in our new software and control segment. And finally, the domain expertise provided by our lifecycle services ensures the positive business outcomes that give our customers a faster return on their automation investment. The three segments will continue to share a common sales organization and supply chain. Having a single sales force, knowledgeable in their customer's applications, simplifies the way customers interact with us. This is just one way in which simplification delivers efficiencies for both us and our customers. Our leadership will continue to blend experienced Rockwell leaders with fresh perspectives. Fran Wlodarczyk will lead the Intelligent Devices segment; Frank Kulaszewicz will lead the Lifecycle Services segment, and we will begin an external search for the leader of Software & Control. In the interim, Chris Nardecchia, our current Senior Vice President of Information Technology and Chief Information Officer, will serve as the leader for that segment. In addition, to accelerate the evolution of our culture, Becky House has become Chief Administrative and Legal Officer, which includes leadership of our talent, legal, ethics and compliance, and Environmental, Health & Safety teams. Our culture is the foundation for accelerated growth under this new structure. It reflects a willingness to compare ourselves to the best alternatives our stakeholders have; a focus on increasing the speed of decision-making; ensuring we have a steady stream of fresh ideas; and, of course, our strong culture of integrity and inclusion. A more detailed view of what is included in each segment can be found on slide 15. Turning to slide 16. These segments create clear focus for each of these essential offerings, and they all have plenty of room to gain share and profitably accelerate our growth in expanding markets. This new structure positions us well to deliver value to customers in what is being called the new normal. Turning to slide 17, I'll make some additional comments on the secular changes we're seeing in our market. As you may recall, last quarter, we talked about the increasing need for customers to build resiliency and flexibility in their operations and supply chains. That includes the need for life sciences companies to increase their local manufacturing capability for medicines and medical devices in the U.S.; and the need for innovative technologies to drive higher levels of productivity, flexibility, sustainability, traceability, and safety. In the last three months, we have seen examples of all of these trends. Many life sciences companies recently announced they are in the process of expanding their North American manufacturing footprints and supply chains, and other companies in discrete industries are planning to do the same. In the quarter, we also won business with Johnson & Johnson to deliver technology for their new Universal Machine, which represents the epitome of flexible manufacturing. The Universal Machine is a collaborative, mobile robot that will be deployed in response to the COVID-19 crisis, and can be repurposed to do machine loading and unloading, end of line packaging and inspection activities, or warehouse material handling activities where social distancing is needed. We think many companies will be interested in adding this type of flexible automation technology to their manufacturing environments in the future. And evidence continues to build for the need for more remote capabilities. In the quarter, we had a key win in EMEA with a major oil company that is making investments in Sensia technology to significantly increase their remote monitoring capabilities. In addition to our remote monitoring capabilities, the value of our augmented reality offering with PTC is very compelling to customers as they increasingly look for alternative ways to operate their plants efficiently and safely, and to re-skill their workers as quickly as possible. These trends are unfolding now, and as you can see from many of the offerings on this slide, we are well aligned to customers' needs as they manage through this new normal. Nobody is better positioned to bring information technology and industrial operational technology together than Rockwell and our partners. Our customers' efforts to increase resilience and agility have the potential to provide meaningful tailwinds for years to come. With that, let me pass the baton back to Jessica to begin the Q&A session. Good morning. Sure. I mean, we've talked about our culture as involving a steady stream of new ideas. And bringing those new ideas into the organization comes from unlocking that innovation from our existing talent in the organization. It comes from acquisitions, and it comes from hiring at different levels of the organization as well. And we've got great existing leadership in the company, but there's always good ideas that we can incorporate from the outside. And so as we launch this new segment of Software & Control, we do expect to bring those perspectives in with the leader of that segment. Thank you. Yes. I would also add to that, John. And from an EV standpoint, we watch closely. We recognize that the rush to add electric vehicle portfolios from big and small companies is new. And not all of those start-ups are going to survive. So, we manage that closely. I should also add, because so much of our business goes through distribution, we're keeping very close to our distributors during this time so that we're in constant communication to make sure that we understand what they're going through. And so that's an important part of our day-to-day operational activities, both in terms of the direct project business as well as the flow business through distribution. Sure. I think from an electric vehicle standpoint, a lot of these companies, whether they're big established companies that have divisions devoted to EV or they're start-ups, they have to bring a portfolio of vehicles to market to get a return on all that investment. And while those projects, in some cases, have been delayed, we've seen very little in the way of cancellations there. And I think that's probably a general view of the automotive industry in that we did see MRO a little bit better than our expectations in the quarter. It was low, but it was better than we feared. And projects continue to move, although at a slower pace. Yes. So, on the solutions and services, year-over-year, I would just say that our book-to-bill was 1.05 and that we built backlog in the quarter. And that our backlog is up year-over-year for our solutions and services as well. And I think that provides you some indication there. In terms of timing of orders for solutions and services, I think looking at that by week or by month is not always as helpful as it is for our flow business, our product businesses. And so I don't think that providing that by month would be very helpful. What we have seen is some project pushouts. But as more and more customers have opened up, we've seen our services folks being called back into customer locations, and we've seen our solutions people being able to enter some of our customer facilities as well. And so there is an improvement sequentially there. Thank you, Julian. Yes. A couple of things and let me just circle back, Jeff, to put a finer point on Patrick's comments. The order development that we've seen over the last few months is consistent with that idea of a gradual recovery. So, as we look at that year-over-year and sequentially, a gradual recovery is what we continue to see through month-to-date in July. From a food and beverage standpoint, the basic issue is that these companies, given are weighting more heavily towards prepackaged food that goes to the grocery store or directly to the home, they're running full out. And so most of our efforts and theirs are devoted to maintaining production at really high levels. We're seeing a continued demand for flexibility. In this case, the food producers are moving quickly to be able to change their packaging formats to be able to meet what's being bought today. And in many cases, people who were eating at home much more than they ever have. We think that long term, the trend towards additional flexibility will only become greater. People are going to continue to want a variety of packaging formats, and we really haven't seen an overall SKU reduction across the industry. The mantra of the packaging machine OEMs driven by the end-user demand is getting to zero change over time, to go from one packaging format to the next, and we haven't seen any reduction in the focus in that area, which requires a lot of automation. Thank you, Jeff. Good morning. Well, I think our primary industries and the areas within those industries that we're putting particular focus do have good long-term growth prospects. When you talk \u2013 you mentioned Life Sciences, and people are going to continue even after we get past this current environment. People are going to want to live longer, healthier lives and so Life Sciences is going to be a continued area of focus for us. Food and beverage, for obvious reasons, they're going to continue \u2013 it's going to continue to be important. I think the trend towards electric vehicles, increasing. And even in the worst of the lockdowns, the world was still consuming 60 million or 70 million barrels of oil a day. And so the desire to produce that oil as efficiently as possible is in line with what we're doing. In terms of the quantification on our results, it's going to be varied by industry. And I've talked before about how I think we're going to see the movement probably most pronounced in the discrete and the hybrid industries, where you're not as tied to the resource itself sitting in the ground, whether it's mining or oil and gas or what have you. So far, the orders that we've seen that I would call are incremental come from machinery builders in Europe, comes from life sciences companies in the U.S. We've talked a little bit about that. And so I think it's going to be gradual, but these are longer-term trends. And we also look at ourselves and what investments we're making to increase resiliency. And as Patrick said, we are making some capital investments in the U.S. to increase resiliency. In our case, it's to build some of our high-value products in more than one place. And I think when we have those ideas and a lot of our customers are thinking about it like us, then it's fair as soon that they've got similar plans. Well, we certainly intend to continue to gain share. I think it's not only picking the applications such as EV within the broader verticals, but it's also the mix of what we're offering as well. And we've talked a lot about recurring revenue in terms of software and high-value services and then a maybe better balance across the industries as well. So, we talked before about how this year, automotive will be less than 10% of our business, it's very valuable. And we expect that business to grow profitably for us over time. But I like that we're serving a host of industries that have great long-term prospects. And so we do intend to gain share across a broad front. Hey, Josh. Yes. Josh, I can add to that. Even with the restructuring that we announced, a significant portion of that frees up resource for reinvestment. It's not just about the cost savings year-over-year, but it's to focus resources well in the areas that we think are going to be particularly important and in the organizational changes. The primary purpose of that is to accelerate profitable growth. We're looking for efficiencies, and we expect we'll find some, but the primary purpose is to accelerate profitable growth. Yes. It's a great part of the market for us. Traditionally, for a long time, we've had a very good fit with the products when you think about the material handling and sortation. I think we've added some products that have spurred some of the recent opportunities and wins that we've seen. Independent cart is one area, so very high-precision motion control is needed even more than ever, the traceability that's used in their software systems. And so I don't see it as being constrained by products for the automation or channel. We're close to a lot of the key suppliers in the area. But we are, to your point, looking at ways as to how we can develop that even more because that's one of those long-term trends that we continue to expect to benefit from. Yes. Thank you. Yes. I think we continue to expect a gradual recovery in orders and sales. But at the heart of it is the infection rates and to look at how the countries in which we operate in get the spread of infection under control. I think that's really the fundamental pacing item as that improves. Then we have a much more positive outlook. I would also say that, as I did say in my earlier remarks, there's a limit to how long we can keep those temporary reductions in place. And at some point, we would have to substitute more structural reductions for the pay reductions, because we can't go on past a certain amount of time with those temporary reductions affecting our entire workforce. Joe, you're talking specifically about Life Sciences customers? Yes. I mean, we're seeing plans, particularly for those who were developing therapeutics and vaccine candidates. So we're seeing them either directly or through their contract manufacturers in the middle of plans to ramp that up now. Now that's not the entire market. But what is common across the entire life sciences market is the accelerated interest in digital transformation. They know that they're not going to be able to get to scale without the basic automation and the ability to schedule product manufacturing and so on, driven by software. So we're definitely seeing those plans increase. They've got a little bit of the situation that food and beverage does in that many of them are already just trying to ramp up production with their existing assets. But I think we're going to see that over time. I don't expect it to be a step change, but we're definitely seeing the slope with the current increase with respect to Life Sciences customers. Yes. There's no question that the oil and gas business is under a lot of pressure right now. But Sensia's positioned exactly where I would want it to be positioned, and that is focused on operational efficiencies and decreasing the breakeven point to produce a barrel of oil and I think there's some evidence that, that is where the market is investing and that orders for Sensia were actually a little bit better than our expectations in the quarter. So it's a tough spot for oil and gas, but helping them produce more efficiently is right where I want to be. Yes. Thanks, Joe. Thanks, Jessica. To summarize, we remain focused on the well-being of our employees, we're managing prudently through a gradual recovery, and we are taking steps to accelerate long- term profitable growth. Nobody is better positioned to bring information technology and industrial operational technology together than Rockwell and our partners, and we wish you all good health, and thank you for your interest and support."

            "name": "Patrick Goris",
            "content": "Thank you, Blake, and good morning everyone. I'll start on Slide 8, third quarter key financial information. For the third quarter, organic sales were down 17.6% compared to last year, and acquisitions contributed just over 3% to total growth. Currency translation was a larger headwind than expected due to a stronger U.S. dollar, and decreased sales by 1.9 points. Orders performed better than sales, and were down mid-teens year-over-year. Overall, company backlog increased year-over-year for the quarter. Segment operating margin was 16.5%, down 730 basis points compared to last year's record high, primarily due to lower sales. General corporate net expense is up slightly compared to last year, mainly as a result of unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments related to our deferred and non-qualified compensation plans. Adjusted EPS of $1.27 was better than expected. During April's call, I mentioned that we expected adjusted EPS to be a bit over $1, based on an organic sales decline of about 20%. Organic sales performance at minus 17.6% was better than expected, as was product mix, and discrete tax items were about a $0.05 benefit to our results in the quarter. Our results include about $15 million or $0.10 of adjusted EPS of restructuring charges, which are offset by a gain on an asset sale. From an operating earnings perspective, both items are evenly split between the two segments. On the statement of operations on page ten of our press release, the gain on sale is included in other income and the restructuring charges are included in SG&A. You will note that SG&A is up about $9 million year-over-year, reflecting not only the restructuring charges, but also the incremental SG&A from acquisitions made this fiscal year. The combined impact of these two items is a year-over-year increase of over $30 million in SG&A expense. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter of 13.5% was lower than we expected, due to a benefit from option exercises. Free cash flow in the quarter of $311 million was a strong result in this environment, with over 200% conversion on adjusted income \u2013 further enhancing our liquidity. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our operating segments. I will just point out that the main driver of segment margin reduction is lower sales. The book-to-bill for our solutions and services businesses was 1.05 for Q3, with continued project delays impacting these businesses rather than project cancellations. The next slide, 10, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q3 fiscal 2019 to Q3 fiscal 2020. As you can see, core performance was down significantly on the large organic revenue decline in the quarter. Our temporary cost reduction actions, and a lower tax rate, partially mitigated the impact of the large sales decline. The restructuring charge and the gain on the asset sale pretty much offset each other. The Adjusted EPS impact of acquisitions was about $0.05 dilutive, including intangible amortization. Core earnings conversion in the quarter, that is, excluding the effects of acquisitions and currency, was about 50% roughly in line with the outlook comments that I shared with you in April. Before I move on, I want to mention that we continue to be in a strong position regarding our capital structure and liquidity. At June 30, cash on the balance sheet was over $900 million, and our total debt was about $2.4 billion. You can find a current update of our balance sheet and liquidity slide in the appendix. Moving to slide 11, product order trends. This slide shows our global daily order trends for our product businesses. Our product businesses represent about two-thirds of our overall sales, and include our shorter-cycle, book and bill businesses. Within the quarter, daily product orders troughed in April followed by sequential improvement in May, June, and continuing into July through Friday of last week. Our updated guidance assumes this improving trend continues at a gradual pace. Moving to slide 12. I'll provide a brief update on a few things that we discussed on our last earnings call with respect to COVID-19. Our first priority remains employee and customer safety. Access to customer sites improved throughout the third quarter, but remains a challenge for our solutions and services businesses. This affects not only our utilization rates and creates associated inefficiencies, but also project timing. We continue to experience project delays in our solutions and services businesses, and the rate of improvement is slower than we expected in April. We are however not seeing a pickup in cancellations, just project pushouts. Regarding our own manufacturing operations and supply chain, our plants continue to be operational and meet current demand. Supply disruptions have generally been mitigated, but we continue to incur higher freight costs and inefficiencies in our operations as we focus on the safety and well-being of our employees. During the quarter, we approved incremental investments to increase the resiliency of our supply chain and operations. For example, we're in the process of making investments to provide us more flexibility to produce products in multiple locations around the world. This includes capital investments in some of our U.S. facilities. Finally, the temporary cost actions we implemented during Q3 remain in place. The temporary cost actions and absence of a bonus earned are tailwinds for us in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. As these items are reversed, they will present a headwind for fiscal 2021. We intend to neutralize that headwind through the structural cost actions we have taken this year, additional cost savings identified, and by maintaining lower levels of discretionary spending. Let's move on to the next slide, 13, Updated Guidance. We now expect full year fiscal 2020 reported sales to be down approximately 5.5%. We continue to project organic sales to be down about 8% compared to last year. Segment margin is still expected to be about 19.5%. The lower adjusted effective tax rate mainly reflects the discrete items we benefited from in the third quarter. Our updated adjusted EPS guidance range is $7.40 to $7.60. At the midpoint, this is $0.20 higher than prior guidance, reflecting our third quarter performance and a lower tax rate for the full year. On a year-over-year basis, our guidance at the midpoint assumes full-year core earnings conversion, which excludes the impacts of currency and acquisitions, of about 35%. General corporate net is still expected to be about $95 million. Purchase accounting amortization expense for the full year is expected to be about $40 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2020 is still expected to amount to about $100 million. We expect non-controlling-interest to be slightly positive, given lower earnings at Sensia. We expect continued strong free cash flow performance, with free cash conversion of over 100% of adjusted income. Finally, with respect to repurchases, we spent about $50 million in the third quarter. Our guidance does not assume any additional share repurchases for the remainder of fiscal 2020. Average fully diluted share count is now expected to be 116.6 million for fiscal 2020. Our capital deployment priorities remain the same. Our first priority is organic growth. After that, we focus capital deployment on inorganic activities. Then, we focus on capital returns to shareowners, through our dividend and then share repurchases. With that, I'll turn it back over to you Blake to for some additional remarks before we start Q&A. Good morning, Scott. Yes, Scott. Good morning. Patrick, here. We're still fine-tuning this a little bit and operationalizing the changes, of course. But preliminary estimates based on fiscal 2019 results, and the numbers I'm going to give you is, give or take, a few points in each the direction. Think of Intelligent Devices as being about 20%, Software & Control about 30%, and Lifecycle Service is about 15%. And so roughly, these are based on fiscal 2019, the segment margins. And I would add to that, Scott, that \u2013 and it may be very helpful for you guys is we do not intend to change our definition of segment operating earnings. Yes. Thanks, Scott. Yes, John. Patrick here. From a probably a receivable risk or credit and collection risk, we would actually say that in the last quarter overall, our overall, call it, the current receivable percent actually slightly improved. And so I'd say that doesn't mean that there are some \u2013 one these twosies, where we may have some challenges. We always have that. But I'd say our overall portfolio has actually improved in the last quarter. Yes, John. So, in April, we mentioned that we implemented cost reductions that would yield over $150 million in year-over-year savings. That included a significant amount from temporary actions related to not having a bonus this year, but also some of the temporary pay cuts we implemented. We are achieving the savings we targeted. The temporary actions remain in place. As we undo dose temporary actions in fiscal 2021, they provide a headwind. That headwind, based on, as Blake mentioned in his comments, on doing the pay cuts at the end of the calendar year, that headwind is a little north of $130 million. We intend to neutralize that through: one, structural cost actions we've taken in September last year with some carryover, but also the cost actions that we've announced today. Those combined are expected to yield over $40 million of incremental savings in fiscal 2021. We've identified additional cost savings that are a little over $50 million. And then finally, we expect to maintain lower levels of discretionary spend going forward. Maybe a little bit more color on the additional cost savings that I talked about. That includes permanent elimination of some open positions. In fiscal 2020, we have some one-time costs and inefficiencies related to the pandemic or even acquisitions, and we're in the process of reducing our real estate footprint globally. And so a lot of moving pieces there, but it is our intention to neutralize the reversal of temporary actions in fiscal 2021 through these cost actions. Thank you, John. Hi, Julian. I would also add Julian, that the solutions and services orders and shipments are probably a little more subject to calendarization within the quarter to our products and that orders tend to come in later in the month and the last month of the quarter for both orders and shipments is typically stronger. So, it's a little more sensitive to which month you're in than the product flow. Yes. So, investment spend for the second half of the year is about down, about 6% year-over-year. Basically the same as what I shared with you last quarter. In terms of Q4 decrementals, they will be better. And so we expect our core decrementals to be in the mid-20s in Q4 and the main reason for that is that we get a bigger benefit from the temporary cost actions. We get three months rather than two months and in the fourth quarter compared to the last year, we have about a $30 million benefit as well from lower incentive compensation expense. So, higher run rate of the cost actions we have taken and also a bigger tailwind for lower incentive compensation in the fourth quarter. Thank you, Julian. The order transfer, they were still down significantly versus the prior year for both June and July. And so we \u2013 the worst performance year-over-year from an order perspective was in April. We've improved sequentially since, but they're still down in the mid-teens for both June. And we're, I would say, gradually improving sequentially and as well as the year-over-year delta is becoming smaller. April was the worst from a year-over-year perspective. And the subsequent months were a little bit better from a year-over-year perspective on the order intake. Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, Andy. Yes. I think the way you can think about it, Josh, is that going back to our framework of our objective to deliver mid-single digits of organic growth, 30% to 35% earnings conversion. And so the level of growth will determine how much more we intend to invest, but I can't give you a certain percent that says this will be a trigger to invest more than we otherwise would. But that long-term framework of 30% to 35% earnings conversion at mid-single digits, it's something that over a longer period of time we intend to adhere to. Yes, Nigel, Patrick here. So actually for our product order intake, July tends to be somewhat similar than June historically. And so what we're seeing now is somewhat typical. On the sales side, normally, the first month after the end of the quarter is a little bit weaker than the prior. And so I would say \u2013 go ahead, Nigel? It is still early in July, but what we've seen so far is not untypical. And of course, our guidance assumes that we'll see continued improving trends sequentially. Thanks. Good morning, Joe."

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jessica Kourakos, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Kourakos, please go ahead.\nJessica Kourakos: Thanks, Sharon. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Patrick Goris, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include and our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at the website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today\u2019s call. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. So with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Blake.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Jessica, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Before I begin, let me say to everyone listening on this call, thank you for your interest and support and I hope that you and those close to you are safe and healthy. We\u2019re truly in unprecedented times and our first priority is protecting employee health and safety. Our employees are doing outstanding work, keeping our customers operations up and running strong during this crisis. We are an essential business that supports critical infrastructure because our customers cannot build their products at scale without automation. So thank you to our employees, our suppliers, our distribution partners and everyone else who has been working hard to serve our customers and communities. This pandemic will change how we live our lives and operate our businesses in the future. Rockwell\u2019s financial strength positions us well to overcome the current challenges and to be more valuable than ever as our customers learn to operate in this new environment. Let me now review the topics for today\u2019s call. I\u2019ll first offer some color on how our people and our customers are effectively managing through this crisis. Then provide a brief overview of our Q2 performance, including a status report on our operations and supply chain and then focus more time on what we are seeing today in our outlook. Please turn to Page 3 of the slide deck. When I think about how our business is being conducted right now and how we are handling the current environment, I start with our employees and our customers. The safety of our employees is always our first priority. We closely follow U.S. CDC and World Health Organization guidelines. For our manufacturing workforce, we provide health screening, enhanced cleaning measures and use of safety equipment and have implemented social distancing between workstations across our facilities. Our non-manufacturing workforce has been exercising social distancing and working from home for over a month now. And we have restricted nonessential business travel, where we can, we\u2019re using our own technologies and services to keep our people productive and support our customers. For example, we now have 2,500 seats of Vuforia augmented reality activated internally to conduct witness testing as well as customer support and training. Turning to our customers. This health crisis is bringing us even closer to our customers as everyone is rallying to help manufacture more necessary goods than ever before. For example, we have a strong partnership with 3M, as they ramp up respirator production. And we recently collaborated with Han Chang Machinery, a Chinese hygiene products machine builder to increase the production capacity of their high speed mask making machine. Our solution based on Logix and our next-generation motion controllers increase their output from 150 to 500 mask per minute. We\u2019re also supporting AVID Labs another pharmaceutical company to increase testing capacity and with GE Healthcare and others to ramp up their production of ventilators. We\u2019re also supporting companies like Roche and Cytiva, who are working tirelessly to develop treatments and vaccines and are investing in manufacturing capabilities, so that they are ready to scale up production as soon as possible. We\u2019re also helping companies who have repurposed manufacturing assets to now produce mask, ventilators, test kits and other equipment our communities desperately need. For example, automotive and mining OEMs are now making ventilators and food and beverage machine builders are now making masks. Even the Jameson Distillery, which is located near our offices in Ireland, has diverted some of their whiskey production lines to now produce alcohol sanitizing gels for hospitals and medical centers. These are just a few stories showcasing the innovation going on in these difficult times. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 4 for our Q2 performance and some key accomplishments in the quarter. Total sales grew slightly in the quarter, including a 3 point contribution from inorganic investments, primarily related to our Sensia joint venture. Organic sales were flat versus last year and were in line with what we were expecting heading into the quarter despite an 18% decline in China related to COVID-19. Our organic sales performance benefited from strong sales of Logix, which grew 8% versus the prior year, led by strength in North America, particularly in automotive and food and beverage. In addition to Logix, we continue to see strong growth in other core platforms like Independent Cart technology for motion control and network infrastructure. Both of these grew double digits in the quarter and we think we\u2019re taking share. We also had a number of important strategic wins in automotive, food and beverage, life sciences, mining and tire where we were not the incumbent control platform. Information Solutions and Connected Services or ISCS for short was down slightly largely due to a difficult comparison with major projects last year. That said, the pipeline for ISCS remain strong. We built strong backlog in the quarter and we still expect ISCS sales to reach $400 million for the year. Our IoT offering continues to differentiate itself in the marketplace. In the quarter, Rockwell was awarded the Industrial IoT Company of the Year by Compass Intelligence, which adds to our recent recognition in Gartner\u2019s annual Magic Quadrant survey as a leader in IoT software. We also saw very strong orders for Vuforia as we help customers expand their remote engineering capabilities during this pandemic. Turning now to Q2 earnings. Adjusted EPS grew 19% and includes the release of our bonus accrual. And finally, free cash flow grew about 9% in the quarter, underscoring Rockwell\u2019s solid financial health and strong balance sheet position. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 5, where I will provide a few highlights of our Q2 organic end market performance. Our discreet market segment grew high single digits led by auto, which grew by over 20% year-over-year and grew double digits sequentially. Auto performed well above expectations in the quarter in almost every region. We continue to see very good growth in electric vehicle programs, we also benefited from some traditional projects that we\u2019ve been tracking. Our Hybrid market segment was flat in Q2. Our largest segment Food and Beverage grew low single digits, including growth at packaging OEMs. Life sciences declined modestly due to the very tough comparison to last year. Many of our customers, particularly those in consumer focused hybrid industries have been running their operations 24/7 to meet very high demand and have had little opportunity to implement projects that divert resources from current production. Process markets were down mid single digits with oil and gas also down mid single digits. We\u2019ll talk more about our outlook for oil and gas in just a few minutes. Turning now to Slide 6 and our organic regional sales performance in the quarter. Growth in North America and Latin America was offset by an 18% decline in China, which accounts for about 6% of our global revenue. We saw growth in Asia Pacific excluding China, led by EV battery. EMEA was down low single digits, but with relative strength in automotive, food and beverage, life sciences and semiconductor. Turning now to Slide 7. Let me take a few minutes here to discuss how we\u2019re navigating the current environment. I first want to say that I\u2019m very proud of the efforts we have taken to build resiliency in our operations and supply chain over the years. Our plants are operational and meeting current demand. And while the many actions we had taken to mitigate tariffs over the last couple of years reduce the impact from COVID-19 on our Chinese supply chain, segments of our global supply chain are seeing some disruption. Among the biggest challenges have been reworking product flows to implement social distancing and managing shifts to limit the number of employees in a facility at one time. We are actively managing what is a very fluid situation. Patrick will have more details on our operations and supply chain. As part of our actions to mitigate risk in our business and maintain our strong financial position, we announced earlier this month a series of temporary actions to better align our costs with a reduction in demand. The following principles of the foundation for our decision making, keep our customer focus, protect employment as much as possible, protect our most important initiatives and investments to drive long-term differentiation and position our company for success over the long-term. Balancing the near-term with the long-term is extremely important. This is why we have and we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet. Our capital deployment priorities remain in order, organic and inorganic investments followed by dividends and repurchases. Turning to Slide 8. The acquisitions we announced last quarter, ASEM and Kalypso are expected to close in the next couple of weeks and we will continue to look for additional inorganic investment opportunities that advance our strategic objectives. We expect ASEM and Kalypso to contribute about 0.5 of revenue growth this year and over 1 point of growth on a full year basis. Together with our inorganic investments, we expect total inorganic sales to contribute about 4% to 4.5% of top line growth in fiscal 2020. Turning now to our outlook on Slide 9. We\u2019re focused on delivering value to all of our stakeholders through these rapidly changing market conditions. The path of recovery is difficult to predict. As we put together our forecast, we looked at a variety of inputs. Our recent performance in China and Italy, near-term industrial production forecast, our daily sales and order intake through April and what we are hearing from end customers and distributors. We expect that our fiscal third quarter sales will be down approximately 20% year-over-year followed by sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. As a result, these are our expectations for the year. Organic sales down 8% at the midpoint, we continue to expect inorganic investments now including ASEM and Kalypso to contribute about 4% to 4.5% of growth to the year, adjusted EPS of $7.30 at the midpoint and we\u2019re projecting free cash flow to convert at over 100%. As you can see from our organic end market projections for the second half and full year on Slide 10, the midpoint of our projections assumes both automotive and oil and gas will see particularly steep declines in the second half of the year. We were also modeling more modest declines in food and beverage and other industries. We expect most verticals including auto, the bottom in Q3 gradually recover starting in Q4 with the exception of oil and gas that we think will take longer to recover. With that, let me now turn it over to Patrick who will elaborate on our second quarter financial performance and fiscal 2020 outlook in his remarks. Patrick?\nPatrick Goris: Thank you, Blake and good morning everyone. I will keep my remarks on second quarter results very brief and then switch to comments about our strong financial position, what we see in our supply chain and operations, cost mitigation activities and fiscal 2020 outlook. I\u2019ll start on Slide 11. For the second quarter organic sales growth \u2013 organic sales were down 0.2% compared to last year and acquisitions contributed 3% to total growth. Currency translation was a larger headwind than expected due to a stronger U.S. dollar and decreased sales by 1.5 points. Within the quarter, organic seals were up low single digits through February with a very weak performance in China. Again through February, China was down about 30% more than offset by better than expected North America product sales. Global organic sales weakened in March and were down a little less than 4% for the month compared to last year. Overall company backlog including for products and for solutions and services increased both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis for the quarter. Segment operating margin was 22.1% up 80 basis points compared to last year, primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense. Our incentive programs are highly correlated to financial performance of the company. We no longer expect an incentive compensation payout to be earned for fiscal 2020 and we therefore released our incentive accruals. This represents a little over 200 basis points of segment margin tailwind, which is partially offset by margin headwinds related to currency at a little over 0.5 point of margin and the impact of acquisitions at about 0.5 point. General corporate net expense was lower compared to last year, mainly as a result of favourable mark to market adjustments related to our deferred and non-qualified compensation plans. I\u2019ll cover the adjusted EPS bridge on a following slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter of 12.4% was lower than we expected due to several discrete items. Free cash flow in the quarter of about $200 million, included a $31 million tax payment, which represents the second installments on the repatriation tax that is owed as a result of tax reform. Slide 12 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our operating segments. Architecture & Software had good organic growth in the quarter with strong Logix performance. Lower incentive compensation was a margin tailwind of about 200 basis points for this segment. Currency was about a 100 basis point headwind. Organic sales of the Control Products & Solutions segment decreased 3.6% with the products within this segment down 3%, and the solutions and services down about 4%. Sensia represents almost all of the 5.8% revenue growth from inorganic investments in this segment. Second quarter organic book-to-bill for our solutions and services businesses was 1.10. As I mentioned earlier, we built backlog in the quarter including for solutions and services. But starting in March, we have seen an increase in project delays initiated by customers. Operating margin for the Control Products & Solutions segment was down 70 basis points compared to last year. The next Slide 13 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q2 fiscal 2019 to Q2 fiscal 2020. As you can see, core performance was up a little less than $0.05 despite no organic revenue growth in the quarter. Large tailwinds related to incentive compensation and the lower tax rates were partially offset by the impact of currency. As expected, the impact of acquisitions was about neutral. I\u2019ll switch gears now and will provide some comments about our balance sheet and liquidity. Please move to Slide 14. We continue to be in a strong position with regard to our capital structure and liquidity. At March 31, cash on the balance sheet was about $640 million and our total debt was about $2.1 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.0. Last week, we executed the $400 million term loan, which provides us the funds to close two previously announced acquisitions, ASEM and Kalypso as well as funds for other general corporate purposes. The two acquisitions are expected to close in the next few weeks with a combined purchase price of $300 million. We expect both acquisitions to add about 0.5 point of revenue to fiscal 2020 sales and expect the fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS impact, including one-time costs to be about $0.05 headwind. From a liquidity perspective, in addition to our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation profile, we have access to the commercial paper market for our operating needs. Our single A credit ratings provide us good access to the capital markets. And finally, our liquidity is also supported by our existing $1.25 billion credit facility, which expires in November of 2023. This credit facility remains available and undrawn. The only financial covenant we have in our debt agreements is an EBITDA to the interest expense covenant in our credit facility and the new term loan. We have plenty of room under debt covenant, which we have pressure tested in our scenario analysis. As you know, we have a history of generating solid free cash flow, and we expect, just like in prior downturns working capital reduction to be a source of cash. We\u2019re also deferring non-critical capital expenditures and now expect fiscal 2020 capital expenditures to be closer to $130 million compared to $160 million prior guidance. Finally, as we have mentioned in the past, we do not expect to have any mandatory U.S. pension contributions in the next few years and we have no long term debt maturities until 2025. In a nutshell, we continue to be in the strong financial position and are focused on maintaining it. Next, I\u2019ll make some comments about what we\u2019re seeing in our supply chain, manufacturing, distribution operations, as well as our solutions and services businesses on Slide 15. We have a global supply chain, including a network of suppliers and manufacturing and distribution facilities. Our supply chain team is closely managing our end-to-end supply chain with a particular focus on all critical and at risk suppliers and supplier locations globally. In late January and early February, we proactively increased inventory levels of certain, mostly China source components and products. We are currently experiencing some isolated supply and cross-border transit disruptions and do see some increased supply chain costs, particularly related to reduce the air freight capacity. We\u2019re implementing freight surcharges to help mitigate the impact of these higher input costs. All of our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are operating at this time. We have implemented additional safety and hygiene processes, including separation of shifts and social distancing between workstations to keep our employees safe. Some of the operational changes implemented as well as some unplanned employee absenteeism are driving some inefficiencies in our operations, which we\u2019re in the process of addressing. Our solutions and services businesses include thousands of domain experts. They understand our customer\u2019s challenges and priorities and design and implement solutions and provide services through a combination of domain expertise and our technology. Physical access to our customer facilities is often important as we delivered those solutions and services. As a result of COVID-19 access to customer facilities in some instances has been difficult, for example, for onsite commissioning. While we have been leveraging our technology and that of our partners to deliver certain services and solutions remotely, decreased access has led to some project delays as well as inefficiencies due to lower labor utilization. We intend to protect our domain experts as much as possible during this period. Moving to Slide 16, overview of cost actions. In early April, we announced several actions to address the current and anticipated business conditions as a result of the pandemic. I won\u2019t go through all of these, but will point out that all these actions are expected to yield over $150 million of savings for fiscal 2020. As the salary reductions take effect May 1, we expect most of the savings to be realized in our fourth quarter. We have identified additional cost actions to implement, if business conditions require or to reallocate resources through our highest priorities. Finally, note that well, our overall cost structure is coming down. We have maintained and in some cases are selectively increasing investments in some of our highest priority areas in order to increase differentiation and create long term value for customers and shareholders. This takes us to Slide 17. This slide presents an overview of the business conditions we saw in China and Italy, two of our larger end markets which were impacted by COVID-19 before other geographies. Note that the China and Italy charts provide an overview of the year-over-year growth in order intake for our product businesses only. Products are two-thirds of our business and represent our shorter cycle book-and-bill business. As you can see, the impact in China was severe in January and February, followed by a very strong V-shaped recovery in March. That has continued in April through Friday of last week. In Italy, we saw year-over-year product orders growth through January, followed by a weak February and March. Order intake in Italy remains weak in April, but it\u2019s up about 10% sequentially, when compared to March order rates. Using our product order trends in China and Italy as leading indicators, we expect most of our other geographies to be down significantly in the third quarter and expect a more gradual recovery starting late in the third quarter into our fourth quarter. Directionally, we expect solutions and services to also follow this trend. Moving to the right side of the slide, this represents our total company sales including solutions and service. Our guidance midpoint assumes that Q3 overall company organic sales will be down about 20% year-over-year, followed by a sequential improvement in our fourth quarter, which we estimate to be up about 10% sequentially, but still down over 10% compared to last year. Let\u2019s move on to Slide 18, guidance. Incorporating the expected revenue contributions from ASEM and Kalypso as well as updated currency forecasts, we now expect full year fiscal 2020 reported sales of about $6.35 billion and project organic sales to be down between 9.5% and 6.5% compared to last year. Segment margin is expected to be in a range of 18.5% to 19.5% compared to 20.5% \u2013 21.5% prior guidance, mostly as a result of lower volumes, partially offset by our cost actions. The lower adjusted effective tax rate mainly reflects some of the discrete benefits we recorded in the second quarter. Slide 19 represents the full year fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS bridge, midpoint of January guidance to midpoint of April guidance. Core performance includes the large unfavorable impact of volume and mix as well as some of the inefficiencies in our supply chain, operations and solutions and services I referred to. These are partially offset by our cost reduction actions, including lower incentive compensation. A headwind from currency and acquisitions is mostly offset by the lower tax rate. On a year-over-year basis, our guidance at the midpoint assumes full year core earnings conversion, which excludes the impact of currency and acquisitions of a little over 35%. We expect a particularly challenging third quarter. This is the quarter during which we expect our sales to trough with the weakest performance in our higher margin product businesses, and we won\u2019t have the full run rate savings of all the actions we implemented. We expect third quarter adjusted EPS to be a little over $1 per share. A few additional comments. General corporate net is now expected to be closer to $95 million. Purchase accounting amortization expense for the full year is expected to be about $45 million, up $30 million compared to last year. Net interest expense for fiscal 2020 is still expected to be about $100 million. We expect non-controlling interest now to be about neutral, given lower expected sales and earnings at Sensia. Average fully diluted share count is now expected to be $160 million for fiscal 2020. With respect to repurchases, we are currently in the market but are monitoring business conditions closely to inform the level of repurchases going forward. Finally, we expect continued strong free cash flow performance with free cash flow conversion over 100% of adjusted income as we liquidate working capital, particularly in the fourth quarter. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to you, Blake, for some closing remarks before Q&A.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Patrick. We\u2019re managing our costs and protecting our balance sheet against the current reality of unprecedented volatility, but we\u2019re also considering long-lasting changes that are being accelerated by the pandemic. We remain optimistic about a world that learns to reduce the human toll from COVID-19 and about Rockwell\u2019s role in increasing business resilience. Here are some thoughts about that future, starting with the industries that we think will be especially important. It\u2019s clear that countries like the U.S. want to increase local manufacturing capability for medicines and medical devices, and we continue to grow share and capabilities in life sciences. I\u2019ve spoken earlier about some of the ways we\u2019re helping pharmaceutical and medical device companies scale up the production of critically needed products during this crisis. Packaged food and beverages are critically important when going out is not an option. Rockwell\u2019s Food & Beverage business is roughly 70% retail for grocery stores and home delivery and 30% food service or restaurants. End users as well as machine builders depend on Rockwell for the speed, flexibility and support that we can provide. Electric vehicles are going to continue to increase their share. Our Q2 growth in auto had a significant EV and battery component. And while we expect a tough road for the auto industry over the next few quarters, our investments in motion technology and software for these applications will continue to bear fruit. The Oil & Gas industry is going to be focused on lower cost production, not CapEx-driven capacity. Our focus on new technology that lowers ongoing production costs from existing assets will be most important for operators for the foreseeable future. Innovation will be necessary to lower the breakeven point for a barrel of oil. With respect to manufacturing footprint, we expect companies to reduce single points of failure in their supply chain and plant capacity. We are increasing the resilience of our own worldwide system, and we know our customers have plans to do the same. We are already seeing some manufacturers\u2019 plans to return manufacturing to North America where we have higher share. Remote support of operations will be important across many industries. To provide expertise virtually when being physically on-site is impossible. We\u2019re already doing this for hundreds of companies. To ensure the highest quality and safety of products, product traceability is becoming more important, which is an application we know very well from our life sciences experience. Flexibility is one of the biggest benefits of automation. Rapidly ramping up output, designing lines to run multiple products and changing packaging to meet evolving demand is likely to be even more important in the future. Software that simulates throughput under different conditions and optimizes production is a part of this flexibility, and we have a strong and growing offering in this area. Finally, we\u2019re seeing diverse companies come together to solve tough problems quicker than we ever thought possible. This is about the power of partnerships and the humility to recognize that no one company can do it all. Partnering is a fundamental part of our culture. For all of these reasons, we believe we are well positioned for a bright future. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jessica to start Q&A.\nJessica Kourakos: Thanks, Blake. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Sharon, let\u2019s take our first question.\nOperator: First question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Good morning, guys. So just on all these cost actions, how much of this flows into 2021?\nPatrick Goris: Steve, Patrick here. It will depend on when we undo some of those temporary actions, and that will depend on the business conditions. So the answer is it depends on when business conditions improve and when we feel comfortable undoing some of these temporary actions.\nSteve Tusa: Do any of the saves carry over into 2021? Like is there another step-up? I mean the incentive comp seems like it\u2019s kind of an annual thing. I would assume you\u2019re now down to kind of zero on that. I guess I don\u2019t see any real structural kind of change in the cost base. So I\u2019m just wondering, is there any \u2013 are there any incremental savings if revenues don\u2019t come back?\nPatrick Goris: Yes. So obviously, we have taken some structural actions in September, which are yielding savings this year. We implemented temporary, not permanent, cost reductions at this time because we think it\u2019s a temporary, not a permanent event. I want to protect our development programs in our R&D. Now also those temporary actions enabled us to have a quick cost impact with no cash cost to implement. And as I mentioned, we have identified additional, including structural cost actions, that we can implement if business conditions require or to reallocate resources to our highest priorities.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And then just on the fourth quarter, obviously, you guys are conservative, so the $1, we\u2019ll take with a grain of salt, but still kind of a bounce back from even a number that\u2019s close to $1 in 4Q. Is that based on kind of backlog visibility? Front log? What\u2019s kind of \u2013 what gives you the confidence of that kind of bounce back in fourth quarter?\nPatrick Goris: Yes. So the $1, Steve, that was for the third quarter that I mentioned, a little over $1. So the fourth quarter, we expect sequential improvement just because \u2013 and given also what we\u2019ve seen in geographies like in China and in Italy, we\u2019ve seen a deep, call it, pullback, followed by a gradual improvement. And that is our 10% sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, which we expect to be broad-based, but with the exception of Oil & Gas where we\u2019re not projecting an improvement.\nBlake Moret: Yes. And if I can add to that as well. Steve, we did build backlog both year-over-year and sequentially in the quarter. And we have seen project delays, as Patrick mentioned, but we haven\u2019t seen cancellations. So we still do see people in certain of the industries that we talked about continuing with plans, and that\u2019s separate from the current rush to increase capacity in some of the essential products, and we\u2019ve certainly seen additional business in those areas.\nSteve Tusa: Great, all right, guys. Thanks a lot, I appreciate it.\nOperator: Next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Good morning. Maybe just wanted to drill in firstly on that second half, the decremental margins look very severe in that second half, maybe 50%, 60% or so year-on-year. Maybe just help us understand the phasing, first half to second half, of the $100 million or so of investment spend and also of the $150 million plus of savings. And any color you could give, like how much of an impact from mix are you dialing in and from those supply chain inefficiencies?\nPatrick Goris: Yes. Julian, if you look at our earnings conversion for the full year, and I call it core convergence, so I exclude the impact of acquisitions, which have a significant impact, and currency, for the full year, earnings conversion is a little over 35% on 8% revenue \u2013 organic revenue drop at the midpoint. For the second half, again, adjusting for the impact of currency and acquisitions, our conversion is a little bit below 40%.\nJulian Mitchell: I see. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And what\u2019s the phasing of that investment spend, Patrick, that $100 million or so? If you could split that at all, first half, second half or something.\nPatrick Goris: Julian, you\u2019re referring to the temporary actions?\nJulian Mitchell: Yes, the temporary actions. And also, I think you talked about some \u2013 you\u2019d lowered the investment spending, step-up assumption for the year. So just wondered how that spending delta shifts at all first half or second half.\nPatrick Goris: Got it. So the temporary actions will have a bigger impact in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter just because of the timing of our pay cuts. So that\u2019s one. If I look specifically in our January guidance, we had said investment spending would be up about 2% year-over-year. That\u2019s about $40 million. Currently, we expect that to be down 3% for the full year, and so that\u2019s a $100 million swing versus our January guidance. We think that Q3, Q4 will be down about 6%, 7% each compared to the prior year in terms of spend. And in dollar terms, it would be a little bit more in Q4 than in Q3.\nJulian Mitchell: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. A couple just to further clarify on the cost actions. Patrick, fully understand the earlier comment about the decision on 2021 will come at a later point in time. But if we look at these actions that you\u2019re taking that do yield $150 million plus in 2020, what is the annualized run rate of those actions? Again, you may not continue them for a full year, but what is the annualized run rate of those actions you\u2019ve taken?\nPatrick Goris: Yes. So the run rate of these actions, if I look at the bonus, we cannot count on that after this year, but the full run rate of the pay cuts is north of $100 million. And so we get less than half of that this year. And so there is another \u2013 that is another over $50 million call of an annualized impact if we continue that into next year. But as I said, it will depend on business conditions, whether we do so.\nJeff Sprague: Correct. And just on the incentive compensation, just to be clear, in Q2, we have not only the absence of an accrual, but we have the reversal of the Q1 accrual. And then I\u2019m just wondering, in the second half, what is the comparison? So we\u2019ll have zero accrual in the second half of 2020 versus what actually fell in the second half of 2019?\nPatrick Goris: Yes. So in the \u2013 for the balance of the year, we will have a $30 million decrease in bonus expense that will mostly fall in Q4.\nJeff Sprague: Okay, all right. Thank you very much. Best of luck.\nOperator: Next question comes from John Inch with Gordon Haskett.\nJohn Inch: Good morning, everybody. Guys, you mentioned project delays. But like you said, there are no cancellations. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us a little more color on what verticals or areas of the world you\u2019re seeing these delays, if they\u2019ve been picking up sort of through April. And I know, Patrick, you had also talked about \u2013 you put China and Italy into a context \u2013 or certainly, you put China into a context of a V-shaped recovery, but your overall commentary seems to be anticipating something more of a gradual recovery. So I\u2019m curious if you could juxtapose those two, that two commentary, do you think China, is this something of an anomaly, it rebounds much more quickly versus rest of world? Or can rest of world actually pick up steam based on everything you\u2019re seeing, backlog and all that sort of stuff?\nBlake Moret: Yes. John, so with respect to project delays, I don\u2019t think we saw any acceleration through April. But think of final acceptance tests where it requires \u2013 it might require some visitation. Those are the types of things in projects that are causing delays because people just either can\u2019t get to the factory to take a look at the system before they take delivery or on-site for the commissioning that Patrick talked about. So those are the types of things that characterize delays. Oil & Gas would certainly see some of those because those are often coordinated type systems. In terms of the modeling for the recovery, we mentioned some of the inputs that we looked at. We looked at China, which was a strong shape recovery. We looked at Italy, which was a little bit more gradual. And consumer demand for our customers\u2019 end products will be something that we\u2019ll be looking at closely. But we thought taking something between the two would make sense, and so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve incorporated in our guidance. We\u2019re watching orders daily to see the development around the world and in different industries.\nJohn Inch: So that makes sense. I guess in terms of \u2013 just in terms of the environment, like is this comparable to 2008, 2009? Or is there something that\u2019s very different? Is there something that\u2019s very different about it? And also, I mean are you expecting Oil & Gas to cancel? I mean, oil prices are pretty darn low. Like I realize that you guys are about OpEx and it really \u2013 it\u2019s about productivity and so forth. But how are you thinking about that vertical? It\u2019s one of your largest and presumably most profitable.\nBlake Moret: Yes. So a couple of things. So first of all, with respect to comparisons with 2008, 2009, I think there was more of a structural element to 2008, 2009 with respect to finance infrastructure. We really continue to look at this as an event-driven activity. Now based on the duration, some other things could come into play, but we really do characterize this as something of a different beast than 2008, 2009. In terms of Oil & Gas, we have significant backlog in Oil & Gas. Process safety represents some of the stronger recent order activity, and process safety is going to tend to hold up through this type of event. Our assumptions for oil prices are up to, but not above, $30 a barrel for WTI, for West Texas Intermediate. So we\u2019re not expecting or pricing in some major recovery in terms of oil prices as the basis for our guidance.\nJohn Inch: That\u2019s very helpful. If I could just ask one more. I think there\u2019s a not insignificant risk that the U.S. could enter a partial or full-on cold war with China, especially if it becomes apparent the Chinese manufactured and released the coronavirus. And I\u2019m just wondering, you obviously took these supply chain actions, like is that enough? Like how are you thinking about your China operations strategically? So you mentioned reshoring in the U.S. That\u2019s going to benefit Rockwell. Do you potentially need to step up some of the work around China actions? Or are there other things that you think you could perhaps be doing or are thinking about?\nBlake Moret: Yes. I think the key point to think about is what I mentioned earlier, and that is reducing single points of failure in our supply chain. So whereas people have been looking at their supply chain for a while now as costs and what were previously lower-cost areas are rising and then with the trade war putting further stress on that, I think this event is going to cause people to make some changes in their supply chain. We\u2019re considering changes to add resilience to our operations. And when we\u2019re thinking about it, I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of our customers who are thinking the same thing. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they\u2019re going to bring it all back to the U.S. But the concept of being local to their most important markets and to have more than one place where you\u2019re manufacturing your high-value products, we think a lot of manufacturers are going to follow that path coming out of this.\nJohn Inch: Yes, I agree. And it just doesn\u2019t make sense to have all our pharmaceuticals manufactured in China. Thanks very much, guys, appreciate it.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Good morning, everybody.\nBlake Moret: Good morning.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Just to kind of follow on that last question. I guess, Blake, you mentioned already seeing some input from customers on regionalized manufacturing or reshoring. What kind of specific industries, I guess, maybe outside of pharmaceuticals have you had those discussions on? It seems awfully early. I get maybe someone wants to kick the tires or at least kind of formulate a plan. But any specific verticals that you\u2019re starting to see an uptake on that discussion on?\nBlake Moret: Yes. So you mentioned pharmaceuticals, medical devices. There are certainly actions that have been dramatically accelerated through this current crisis, other consumer products. So Stanley Black & Decker has talked about bringing closer to their North American markets some of their manufacturing operations. So that would be another example. But I think getting closer to our customers and consumer markets would be a common theme.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just we\u2019ve heard from some other folks that there was a good amount of kind of pull forward and some isolated pushout, but in general, a lot of order shifting, I guess, in March as folks decided what they wanted to do. Did you see any kind of pull forward into the quarter as folks anticipated either trouble in getting products or imminent shutdowns such that they wanted to finish something up before they were done? I think in the long run, this is all a timing noise thing, but just trying to level set, if anything got pulled into the quarter.\nBlake Moret: Yes. We looked at that, and we really didn\u2019t see meaningful pull-ins in the quarter. So we looked at our distributor inventories, which we work closely with distribution on, and there was nothing unusual going on there. And then with respect to automotives, some of the projects that contributed to our strong growth in the quarter included battery-making equipment in Asia, which is an ongoing series of successes that we\u2019ve talked about in previous quarters. We also had line of sight to some more traditional projects by brand owners in internal combustion engines. These are projects that we\u2019ve been tracking for well over a year now. And then some activity additionally in auto from some of the tier suppliers in Europe, especially in Eastern Europe. And so we\u2019ve seen these projects. We\u2019ve been tracking them for a while, and we really haven\u2019t seen a distinctive trend that contributed to our strong Q2 results.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And I appreciate all the color this morning, especially some of your other peers out there pull guidance. So all the detail greatly appreciated. Best of luck.\nBlake Moret: Yes. Thanks, Josh. And just on that note, we thought it was important to share an extra amount of information that we thought was most helpful in navigating the current environment.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Good morning, guys. Really appreciate as the addition color. Can you talk about what you\u2019ve seen in China and Italy in April. I\u2019m sorry if I missed the broader discussion on what you\u2019ve seen in the Americas and Europe more broadly. But how is that down 20% compared to what you\u2019ve seen in April across your portfolio?\nPatrick Goris: Yes, Nigel, Patrick here. In April, globally, and this is for both orders and ships, our product businesses are down about 20% through Friday last week. And so consistent with our projection for the third quarter, what we\u2019re seeing so far this month, and as I said, this is for products, two-thirds of our business.\nNigel Coe: And would you expect April to be worse than 2Q? I mean April is when we\u2019re in the sort of the eye of the storm, if you will, of plant shutdowns. Why wouldn\u2019t we see sequential improvement in May and June?\nPatrick Goris: Nigel, of course, it\u2019s a difficult question. We\u2019ve seen weakness start at the end of March. I think it\u2019s too early for us to say that in April, given where we are, that we have seen a bottom of that we call a bottom. So it\u2019s unclear when we may bottom out. We do believe that, that will be sometime in Q3 in that late this quarter. Mid or late June into the fourth quarter, we will see a sequential improvement.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Fair enough. And then I do want to come back to the 3Q EPS question. Again, the $1 seems like a very low bar, but the decremental margins implied by that are extremely high. So I just want to sort of ask the question a different way. Is there anything we should need to think about in terms of mix or cost pressures or M&A dilution, FX dilution, FX hedges, et cetera, in terms of right setting 3Q EPS?\nPatrick Goris: Yes. So specific to Q3, organic sales down about 20%. That represents well over $300 million of revenue, which is weighted towards our product businesses, which, as you know, carry higher margins. We\u2019re not getting the full run rate of our cost actions given the timing of the pay cuts. And so we expect Q3 to be the trough. So Q3, excluding the impact of acquisitions and currency, we expect our decrementals to be close to about 50% for that quarter because of the reasons I mentioned.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Thanks Patrick.\nPatrick Goris: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stephens.\nRobert McCarthy: Hello, everybody. Yes, I guess a couple of questions. And thank you for taking towards the end of the call. I guess kind of the first question, maybe just update us on PTC and the relationship there, in terms of what\u2019s going on, progress? And do you anticipate we\u2019ll have a virtual Liveworks this year? And kind of what are the \u2013 what\u2019s the agenda, particularly in this environment, to drive growth from that collaboration?\nBlake Moret: Yes. Rob, we\u2019re still very happy with the partnership with PTC. We continue to see orders in the quarter, both on top of our control platforms and also at competitive strongholds where the expanded scope of those offerings and software and augmented reality are winning us new business that we would not have otherwise won. The Liveworks or ROKLive activity will be virtual. I\u2019ll be participating in that. We\u2019ll be talking about new products that we\u2019re working on. And so the partnership remains vibrant even under these conditions, and we continue to strengthen it.\nRobert McCarthy: That\u2019s helpful. And obviously, congratulations on a solid quarter and a constructive guide in providing all the detail. Now that being said, we have seen the market rally pretty significantly here. And at least passively, there seems to be some expectation of what looks like an interruption and then perhaps a U shape or V recovery. But as Anthony Fauci always says, the virus gets to make the call. So if we go into a bit of a double here in terms of the virus comes back, and you\u2019re seeing companies cut CapEx across the board by 20% to 30%, and there\u2019s not a reason to believe we have creeping uncertainty until there\u2019s a vaccine in 16 to 18 months, that you couldn\u2019t have a continued tough business CapEx and fixture environment, which is not good for you despite some of these interesting secular trends for near shoring. How do you think \u2013 how you address that environment? And back to some of the questions around structural cost, what are some of the actions you could take to take some more structural cost out of the business?\nBlake Moret: Yes. Rob, we\u2019re looking closely at that. We\u2019re modeling different views of the recovery, both in terms of shape of the recovery as well as timing, depth and duration, all of those things. And we have plans that are appropriate to those that go into deeper structural reductions if necessary. And so we watch that. We\u2019ve taken those actions in the past, and we\u2019ll take them now if we feel like that\u2019s the appropriate response as the crisis unfolds.\nRobert McCarthy: Well, we\u2019re coming against the market open. And from that standpoint, I think a lot of guys have to write up or cover their ass, upgrade notes to neutral. So with that, I\u2019ll let you go.\nBlake Moret: Okay. Thank you, Rob.\nJessica Kourakos: Thanks, operator. We can take one more question.\nOperator: We have a question from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nNoah Kaye: Thanks for squeezing me at the end here. And I guess the real $10,000 question, Blake, is you talked about a lot of action that manufacturers of all types are going to be taking to improve their business resiliency really as a direct response to this crisis. And in the past, you\u2019ve talked about, even at your Investor Day, talked about being able to grow at a multiple of IP and increasing that. Should we be thinking and is it your view that coming out of this, the nature of the industrial recovery is such that your multiple could even expand as manufacturers take actions that play into your wheelhouse?\nBlake Moret: We\u2019re optimistic, Noah, about our ability to play an even more important role for customers as we go forward. And I\u2019ve given some insight as to the industries and some of the trends that we think we\u2019re well positioned to partner with those customers on. And we\u2019re going to be working hard in those areas, as Patrick mentioned, in some cases even investing in the areas of highest value. And we prefer to win in those opportunities, see the growth, and then we\u2019ll talk about the resulting multiples. But our intention is to make it happen.\nNoah Kaye: I appreciate that. Thanks very much for taking the question.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Noah.\nJessica Kourakos: Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you all for joining us.

            "content": "Thanks, Jessica, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Before I begin, let me say to everyone listening on this call, thank you for your interest and support and I hope that you and those close to you are safe and healthy. We're truly in unprecedented times and our first priority is protecting employee health and safety. Our employees are doing outstanding work, keeping our customers operations up and running strong during this crisis. We are an essential business that supports critical infrastructure because our customers cannot build their products at scale without automation. So thank you to our employees, our suppliers, our distribution partners and everyone else who has been working hard to serve our customers and communities. This pandemic will change how we live our lives and operate our businesses in the future. Rockwell's financial strength positions us well to overcome the current challenges and to be more valuable than ever as our customers learn to operate in this new environment. Let me now review the topics for today's call. I'll first offer some color on how our people and our customers are effectively managing through this crisis. Then provide a brief overview of our Q2 performance, including a status report on our operations and supply chain and then focus more time on what we are seeing today in our outlook. Please turn to Page 3 of the slide deck. When I think about how our business is being conducted right now and how we are handling the current environment, I start with our employees and our customers. The safety of our employees is always our first priority. We closely follow U.S. CDC and World Health Organization guidelines. For our manufacturing workforce, we provide health screening, enhanced cleaning measures and use of safety equipment and have implemented social distancing between workstations across our facilities. Our non-manufacturing workforce has been exercising social distancing and working from home for over a month now. And we have restricted nonessential business travel, where we can, we're using our own technologies and services to keep our people productive and support our customers. For example, we now have 2,500 seats of Vuforia augmented reality activated internally to conduct witness testing as well as customer support and training. Turning to our customers. This health crisis is bringing us even closer to our customers as everyone is rallying to help manufacture more necessary goods than ever before. For example, we have a strong partnership with 3M, as they ramp up respirator production. And we recently collaborated with Han Chang Machinery, a Chinese hygiene products machine builder to increase the production capacity of their high speed mask making machine. Our solution based on Logix and our next-generation motion controllers increase their output from 150 to 500 mask per minute. We're also supporting AVID Labs another pharmaceutical company to increase testing capacity and with GE Healthcare and others to ramp up their production of ventilators. We're also supporting companies like Roche and Cytiva, who are working tirelessly to develop treatments and vaccines and are investing in manufacturing capabilities, so that they are ready to scale up production as soon as possible. We're also helping companies who have repurposed manufacturing assets to now produce mask, ventilators, test kits and other equipment our communities desperately need. For example, automotive and mining OEMs are now making ventilators and food and beverage machine builders are now making masks. Even the Jameson Distillery, which is located near our offices in Ireland, has diverted some of their whiskey production lines to now produce alcohol sanitizing gels for hospitals and medical centers. These are just a few stories showcasing the innovation going on in these difficult times. Let's now turn to Slide 4 for our Q2 performance and some key accomplishments in the quarter. Total sales grew slightly in the quarter, including a 3 point contribution from inorganic investments, primarily related to our Sensia joint venture. Organic sales were flat versus last year and were in line with what we were expecting heading into the quarter despite an 18% decline in China related to COVID-19. Our organic sales performance benefited from strong sales of Logix, which grew 8% versus the prior year, led by strength in North America, particularly in automotive and food and beverage. In addition to Logix, we continue to see strong growth in other core platforms like Independent Cart technology for motion control and network infrastructure. Both of these grew double digits in the quarter and we think we're taking share. We also had a number of important strategic wins in automotive, food and beverage, life sciences, mining and tire where we were not the incumbent control platform. Information Solutions and Connected Services or ISCS for short was down slightly largely due to a difficult comparison with major projects last year. That said, the pipeline for ISCS remain strong. We built strong backlog in the quarter and we still expect ISCS sales to reach $400 million for the year. Our IoT offering continues to differentiate itself in the marketplace. In the quarter, Rockwell was awarded the Industrial IoT Company of the Year by Compass Intelligence, which adds to our recent recognition in Gartner's annual Magic Quadrant survey as a leader in IoT software. We also saw very strong orders for Vuforia as we help customers expand their remote engineering capabilities during this pandemic. Turning now to Q2 earnings. Adjusted EPS grew 19% and includes the release of our bonus accrual. And finally, free cash flow grew about 9% in the quarter, underscoring Rockwell's solid financial health and strong balance sheet position. Let's now turn to Slide 5, where I will provide a few highlights of our Q2 organic end market performance. Our discreet market segment grew high single digits led by auto, which grew by over 20% year-over-year and grew double digits sequentially. Auto performed well above expectations in the quarter in almost every region. We continue to see very good growth in electric vehicle programs, we also benefited from some traditional projects that we've been tracking. Our Hybrid market segment was flat in Q2. Our largest segment Food and Beverage grew low single digits, including growth at packaging OEMs. Life sciences declined modestly due to the very tough comparison to last year. Many of our customers, particularly those in consumer focused hybrid industries have been running their operations 24/7 to meet very high demand and have had little opportunity to implement projects that divert resources from current production. Process markets were down mid single digits with oil and gas also down mid single digits. We'll talk more about our outlook for oil and gas in just a few minutes. Turning now to Slide 6 and our organic regional sales performance in the quarter. Growth in North America and Latin America was offset by an 18% decline in China, which accounts for about 6% of our global revenue. We saw growth in Asia Pacific excluding China, led by EV battery. EMEA was down low single digits, but with relative strength in automotive, food and beverage, life sciences and semiconductor. Turning now to Slide 7. Let me take a few minutes here to discuss how we're navigating the current environment. I first want to say that I'm very proud of the efforts we have taken to build resiliency in our operations and supply chain over the years. Our plants are operational and meeting current demand. And while the many actions we had taken to mitigate tariffs over the last couple of years reduce the impact from COVID-19 on our Chinese supply chain, segments of our global supply chain are seeing some disruption. Among the biggest challenges have been reworking product flows to implement social distancing and managing shifts to limit the number of employees in a facility at one time. We are actively managing what is a very fluid situation. Patrick will have more details on our operations and supply chain. As part of our actions to mitigate risk in our business and maintain our strong financial position, we announced earlier this month a series of temporary actions to better align our costs with a reduction in demand. The following principles of the foundation for our decision making, keep our customer focus, protect employment as much as possible, protect our most important initiatives and investments to drive long-term differentiation and position our company for success over the long-term. Balancing the near-term with the long-term is extremely important. This is why we have and we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet. Our capital deployment priorities remain in order, organic and inorganic investments followed by dividends and repurchases. Turning to Slide 8. The acquisitions we announced last quarter, ASEM and Kalypso are expected to close in the next couple of weeks and we will continue to look for additional inorganic investment opportunities that advance our strategic objectives. We expect ASEM and Kalypso to contribute about 0.5 of revenue growth this year and over 1 point of growth on a full year basis. Together with our inorganic investments, we expect total inorganic sales to contribute about 4% to 4.5% of top line growth in fiscal 2020. Turning now to our outlook on Slide 9. We're focused on delivering value to all of our stakeholders through these rapidly changing market conditions. The path of recovery is difficult to predict. As we put together our forecast, we looked at a variety of inputs. Our recent performance in China and Italy, near-term industrial production forecast, our daily sales and order intake through April and what we are hearing from end customers and distributors. We expect that our fiscal third quarter sales will be down approximately 20% year-over-year followed by sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. As a result, these are our expectations for the year. Organic sales down 8% at the midpoint, we continue to expect inorganic investments now including ASEM and Kalypso to contribute about 4% to 4.5% of growth to the year, adjusted EPS of $7.30 at the midpoint and we're projecting free cash flow to convert at over 100%. As you can see from our organic end market projections for the second half and full year on Slide 10, the midpoint of our projections assumes both automotive and oil and gas will see particularly steep declines in the second half of the year. We were also modeling more modest declines in food and beverage and other industries. We expect most verticals including auto, the bottom in Q3 gradually recover starting in Q4 with the exception of oil and gas that we think will take longer to recover. With that, let me now turn it over to Patrick who will elaborate on our second quarter financial performance and fiscal 2020 outlook in his remarks. Patrick? Thanks, Patrick. We're managing our costs and protecting our balance sheet against the current reality of unprecedented volatility, but we're also considering long-lasting changes that are being accelerated by the pandemic. We remain optimistic about a world that learns to reduce the human toll from COVID-19 and about Rockwell's role in increasing business resilience. Here are some thoughts about that future, starting with the industries that we think will be especially important. It's clear that countries like the U.S. want to increase local manufacturing capability for medicines and medical devices, and we continue to grow share and capabilities in life sciences. I've spoken earlier about some of the ways we're helping pharmaceutical and medical device companies scale up the production of critically needed products during this crisis. Packaged food and beverages are critically important when going out is not an option. Rockwell's Food & Beverage business is roughly 70% retail for grocery stores and home delivery and 30% food service or restaurants. End users as well as machine builders depend on Rockwell for the speed, flexibility and support that we can provide. Electric vehicles are going to continue to increase their share. Our Q2 growth in auto had a significant EV and battery component. And while we expect a tough road for the auto industry over the next few quarters, our investments in motion technology and software for these applications will continue to bear fruit. The Oil & Gas industry is going to be focused on lower cost production, not CapEx-driven capacity. Our focus on new technology that lowers ongoing production costs from existing assets will be most important for operators for the foreseeable future. Innovation will be necessary to lower the breakeven point for a barrel of oil. With respect to manufacturing footprint, we expect companies to reduce single points of failure in their supply chain and plant capacity. We are increasing the resilience of our own worldwide system, and we know our customers have plans to do the same. We are already seeing some manufacturers' plans to return manufacturing to North America where we have higher share. Remote support of operations will be important across many industries. To provide expertise virtually when being physically on-site is impossible. We're already doing this for hundreds of companies. To ensure the highest quality and safety of products, product traceability is becoming more important, which is an application we know very well from our life sciences experience. Flexibility is one of the biggest benefits of automation. Rapidly ramping up output, designing lines to run multiple products and changing packaging to meet evolving demand is likely to be even more important in the future. Software that simulates throughput under different conditions and optimizes production is a part of this flexibility, and we have a strong and growing offering in this area. Finally, we're seeing diverse companies come together to solve tough problems quicker than we ever thought possible. This is about the power of partnerships and the humility to recognize that no one company can do it all. Partnering is a fundamental part of our culture. For all of these reasons, we believe we are well positioned for a bright future. With that, I'll turn it over to Jessica to start Q&A. Yes. And if I can add to that as well. Steve, we did build backlog both year-over-year and sequentially in the quarter. And we have seen project delays, as Patrick mentioned, but we haven't seen cancellations. So we still do see people in certain of the industries that we talked about continuing with plans, and that's separate from the current rush to increase capacity in some of the essential products, and we've certainly seen additional business in those areas. Yes. John, so with respect to project delays, I don't think we saw any acceleration through April. But think of final acceptance tests where it requires \u2013 it might require some visitation. Those are the types of things in projects that are causing delays because people just either can't get to the factory to take a look at the system before they take delivery or on-site for the commissioning that Patrick talked about. So those are the types of things that characterize delays. Oil & Gas would certainly see some of those because those are often coordinated type systems. In terms of the modeling for the recovery, we mentioned some of the inputs that we looked at. We looked at China, which was a strong shape recovery. We looked at Italy, which was a little bit more gradual. And consumer demand for our customers' end products will be something that we'll be looking at closely. But we thought taking something between the two would make sense, and so that's what we've incorporated in our guidance. We're watching orders daily to see the development around the world and in different industries. Yes. So a couple of things. So first of all, with respect to comparisons with 2008, 2009, I think there was more of a structural element to 2008, 2009 with respect to finance infrastructure. We really continue to look at this as an event-driven activity. Now based on the duration, some other things could come into play, but we really do characterize this as something of a different beast than 2008, 2009. In terms of Oil & Gas, we have significant backlog in Oil & Gas. Process safety represents some of the stronger recent order activity, and process safety is going to tend to hold up through this type of event. Our assumptions for oil prices are up to, but not above, $30 a barrel for WTI, for West Texas Intermediate. So we're not expecting or pricing in some major recovery in terms of oil prices as the basis for our guidance. Yes. I think the key point to think about is what I mentioned earlier, and that is reducing single points of failure in our supply chain. So whereas people have been looking at their supply chain for a while now as costs and what were previously lower-cost areas are rising and then with the trade war putting further stress on that, I think this event is going to cause people to make some changes in their supply chain. We're considering changes to add resilience to our operations. And when we're thinking about it, I'm sure there are hundreds of our customers who are thinking the same thing. That doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to bring it all back to the U.S. But the concept of being local to their most important markets and to have more than one place where you're manufacturing your high-value products, we think a lot of manufacturers are going to follow that path coming out of this. Thanks, John. Good morning. Yes. So you mentioned pharmaceuticals, medical devices. There are certainly actions that have been dramatically accelerated through this current crisis, other consumer products. So Stanley Black & Decker has talked about bringing closer to their North American markets some of their manufacturing operations. So that would be another example. But I think getting closer to our customers and consumer markets would be a common theme. Yes. We looked at that, and we really didn't see meaningful pull-ins in the quarter. So we looked at our distributor inventories, which we work closely with distribution on, and there was nothing unusual going on there. And then with respect to automotives, some of the projects that contributed to our strong growth in the quarter included battery-making equipment in Asia, which is an ongoing series of successes that we've talked about in previous quarters. We also had line of sight to some more traditional projects by brand owners in internal combustion engines. These are projects that we've been tracking for well over a year now. And then some activity additionally in auto from some of the tier suppliers in Europe, especially in Eastern Europe. And so we've seen these projects. We've been tracking them for a while, and we really haven't seen a distinctive trend that contributed to our strong Q2 results. Yes. Thanks, Josh. And just on that note, we thought it was important to share an extra amount of information that we thought was most helpful in navigating the current environment. Yes. Rob, we're still very happy with the partnership with PTC. We continue to see orders in the quarter, both on top of our control platforms and also at competitive strongholds where the expanded scope of those offerings and software and augmented reality are winning us new business that we would not have otherwise won. The Liveworks or ROKLive activity will be virtual. I'll be participating in that. We'll be talking about new products that we're working on. And so the partnership remains vibrant even under these conditions, and we continue to strengthen it. Yes. Rob, we're looking closely at that. We're modeling different views of the recovery, both in terms of shape of the recovery as well as timing, depth and duration, all of those things. And we have plans that are appropriate to those that go into deeper structural reductions if necessary. And so we watch that. We've taken those actions in the past, and we'll take them now if we feel like that's the appropriate response as the crisis unfolds. Okay. Thank you, Rob. We're optimistic, Noah, about our ability to play an even more important role for customers as we go forward. And I've given some insight as to the industries and some of the trends that we think we're well positioned to partner with those customers on. And we're going to be working hard in those areas, as Patrick mentioned, in some cases even investing in the areas of highest value. And we prefer to win in those opportunities, see the growth, and then we'll talk about the resulting multiples. But our intention is to make it happen. Thanks, Noah."

            "name": "Patrick Goris",
            "content": "Thank you, Blake and good morning everyone. I will keep my remarks on second quarter results very brief and then switch to comments about our strong financial position, what we see in our supply chain and operations, cost mitigation activities and fiscal 2020 outlook. I'll start on Slide 11. For the second quarter organic sales growth \u2013 organic sales were down 0.2% compared to last year and acquisitions contributed 3% to total growth. Currency translation was a larger headwind than expected due to a stronger U.S. dollar and decreased sales by 1.5 points. Within the quarter, organic seals were up low single digits through February with a very weak performance in China. Again through February, China was down about 30% more than offset by better than expected North America product sales. Global organic sales weakened in March and were down a little less than 4% for the month compared to last year. Overall company backlog including for products and for solutions and services increased both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis for the quarter. Segment operating margin was 22.1% up 80 basis points compared to last year, primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense. Our incentive programs are highly correlated to financial performance of the company. We no longer expect an incentive compensation payout to be earned for fiscal 2020 and we therefore released our incentive accruals. This represents a little over 200 basis points of segment margin tailwind, which is partially offset by margin headwinds related to currency at a little over 0.5 point of margin and the impact of acquisitions at about 0.5 point. General corporate net expense was lower compared to last year, mainly as a result of favourable mark to market adjustments related to our deferred and non-qualified compensation plans. I'll cover the adjusted EPS bridge on a following slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter of 12.4% was lower than we expected due to several discrete items. Free cash flow in the quarter of about $200 million, included a $31 million tax payment, which represents the second installments on the repatriation tax that is owed as a result of tax reform. Slide 12 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our operating segments. Architecture & Software had good organic growth in the quarter with strong Logix performance. Lower incentive compensation was a margin tailwind of about 200 basis points for this segment. Currency was about a 100 basis point headwind. Organic sales of the Control Products & Solutions segment decreased 3.6% with the products within this segment down 3%, and the solutions and services down about 4%. Sensia represents almost all of the 5.8% revenue growth from inorganic investments in this segment. Second quarter organic book-to-bill for our solutions and services businesses was 1.10. As I mentioned earlier, we built backlog in the quarter including for solutions and services. But starting in March, we have seen an increase in project delays initiated by customers. Operating margin for the Control Products & Solutions segment was down 70 basis points compared to last year. The next Slide 13 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q2 fiscal 2019 to Q2 fiscal 2020. As you can see, core performance was up a little less than $0.05 despite no organic revenue growth in the quarter. Large tailwinds related to incentive compensation and the lower tax rates were partially offset by the impact of currency. As expected, the impact of acquisitions was about neutral. I'll switch gears now and will provide some comments about our balance sheet and liquidity. Please move to Slide 14. We continue to be in a strong position with regard to our capital structure and liquidity. At March 31, cash on the balance sheet was about $640 million and our total debt was about $2.1 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.0. Last week, we executed the $400 million term loan, which provides us the funds to close two previously announced acquisitions, ASEM and Kalypso as well as funds for other general corporate purposes. The two acquisitions are expected to close in the next few weeks with a combined purchase price of $300 million. We expect both acquisitions to add about 0.5 point of revenue to fiscal 2020 sales and expect the fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS impact, including one-time costs to be about $0.05 headwind. From a liquidity perspective, in addition to our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation profile, we have access to the commercial paper market for our operating needs. Our single A credit ratings provide us good access to the capital markets. And finally, our liquidity is also supported by our existing $1.25 billion credit facility, which expires in November of 2023. This credit facility remains available and undrawn. The only financial covenant we have in our debt agreements is an EBITDA to the interest expense covenant in our credit facility and the new term loan. We have plenty of room under debt covenant, which we have pressure tested in our scenario analysis. As you know, we have a history of generating solid free cash flow, and we expect, just like in prior downturns working capital reduction to be a source of cash. We're also deferring non-critical capital expenditures and now expect fiscal 2020 capital expenditures to be closer to $130 million compared to $160 million prior guidance. Finally, as we have mentioned in the past, we do not expect to have any mandatory U.S. pension contributions in the next few years and we have no long term debt maturities until 2025. In a nutshell, we continue to be in the strong financial position and are focused on maintaining it. Next, I'll make some comments about what we're seeing in our supply chain, manufacturing, distribution operations, as well as our solutions and services businesses on Slide 15. We have a global supply chain, including a network of suppliers and manufacturing and distribution facilities. Our supply chain team is closely managing our end-to-end supply chain with a particular focus on all critical and at risk suppliers and supplier locations globally. In late January and early February, we proactively increased inventory levels of certain, mostly China source components and products. We are currently experiencing some isolated supply and cross-border transit disruptions and do see some increased supply chain costs, particularly related to reduce the air freight capacity. We're implementing freight surcharges to help mitigate the impact of these higher input costs. All of our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are operating at this time. We have implemented additional safety and hygiene processes, including separation of shifts and social distancing between workstations to keep our employees safe. Some of the operational changes implemented as well as some unplanned employee absenteeism are driving some inefficiencies in our operations, which we're in the process of addressing. Our solutions and services businesses include thousands of domain experts. They understand our customer's challenges and priorities and design and implement solutions and provide services through a combination of domain expertise and our technology. Physical access to our customer facilities is often important as we delivered those solutions and services. As a result of COVID-19 access to customer facilities in some instances has been difficult, for example, for onsite commissioning. While we have been leveraging our technology and that of our partners to deliver certain services and solutions remotely, decreased access has led to some project delays as well as inefficiencies due to lower labor utilization. We intend to protect our domain experts as much as possible during this period. Moving to Slide 16, overview of cost actions. In early April, we announced several actions to address the current and anticipated business conditions as a result of the pandemic. I won't go through all of these, but will point out that all these actions are expected to yield over $150 million of savings for fiscal 2020. As the salary reductions take effect May 1, we expect most of the savings to be realized in our fourth quarter. We have identified additional cost actions to implement, if business conditions require or to reallocate resources through our highest priorities. Finally, note that well, our overall cost structure is coming down. We have maintained and in some cases are selectively increasing investments in some of our highest priority areas in order to increase differentiation and create long term value for customers and shareholders. This takes us to Slide 17. This slide presents an overview of the business conditions we saw in China and Italy, two of our larger end markets which were impacted by COVID-19 before other geographies. Note that the China and Italy charts provide an overview of the year-over-year growth in order intake for our product businesses only. Products are two-thirds of our business and represent our shorter cycle book-and-bill business. As you can see, the impact in China was severe in January and February, followed by a very strong V-shaped recovery in March. That has continued in April through Friday of last week. In Italy, we saw year-over-year product orders growth through January, followed by a weak February and March. Order intake in Italy remains weak in April, but it's up about 10% sequentially, when compared to March order rates. Using our product order trends in China and Italy as leading indicators, we expect most of our other geographies to be down significantly in the third quarter and expect a more gradual recovery starting late in the third quarter into our fourth quarter. Directionally, we expect solutions and services to also follow this trend. Moving to the right side of the slide, this represents our total company sales including solutions and service. Our guidance midpoint assumes that Q3 overall company organic sales will be down about 20% year-over-year, followed by a sequential improvement in our fourth quarter, which we estimate to be up about 10% sequentially, but still down over 10% compared to last year. Let's move on to Slide 18, guidance. Incorporating the expected revenue contributions from ASEM and Kalypso as well as updated currency forecasts, we now expect full year fiscal 2020 reported sales of about $6.35 billion and project organic sales to be down between 9.5% and 6.5% compared to last year. Segment margin is expected to be in a range of 18.5% to 19.5% compared to 20.5% \u2013 21.5% prior guidance, mostly as a result of lower volumes, partially offset by our cost actions. The lower adjusted effective tax rate mainly reflects some of the discrete benefits we recorded in the second quarter. Slide 19 represents the full year fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS bridge, midpoint of January guidance to midpoint of April guidance. Core performance includes the large unfavorable impact of volume and mix as well as some of the inefficiencies in our supply chain, operations and solutions and services I referred to. These are partially offset by our cost reduction actions, including lower incentive compensation. A headwind from currency and acquisitions is mostly offset by the lower tax rate. On a year-over-year basis, our guidance at the midpoint assumes full year core earnings conversion, which excludes the impact of currency and acquisitions of a little over 35%. We expect a particularly challenging third quarter. This is the quarter during which we expect our sales to trough with the weakest performance in our higher margin product businesses, and we won't have the full run rate savings of all the actions we implemented. We expect third quarter adjusted EPS to be a little over $1 per share. A few additional comments. General corporate net is now expected to be closer to $95 million. Purchase accounting amortization expense for the full year is expected to be about $45 million, up $30 million compared to last year. Net interest expense for fiscal 2020 is still expected to be about $100 million. We expect non-controlling interest now to be about neutral, given lower expected sales and earnings at Sensia. Average fully diluted share count is now expected to be $160 million for fiscal 2020. With respect to repurchases, we are currently in the market but are monitoring business conditions closely to inform the level of repurchases going forward. Finally, we expect continued strong free cash flow performance with free cash flow conversion over 100% of adjusted income as we liquidate working capital, particularly in the fourth quarter. With that, I'll hand it back to you, Blake, for some closing remarks before Q&A. Steve, Patrick here. It will depend on when we undo some of those temporary actions, and that will depend on the business conditions. So the answer is it depends on when business conditions improve and when we feel comfortable undoing some of these temporary actions. Yes. So obviously, we have taken some structural actions in September, which are yielding savings this year. We implemented temporary, not permanent, cost reductions at this time because we think it's a temporary, not a permanent event. I want to protect our development programs in our R&D. Now also those temporary actions enabled us to have a quick cost impact with no cash cost to implement. And as I mentioned, we have identified additional, including structural cost actions, that we can implement if business conditions require or to reallocate resources to our highest priorities. Yes. So the $1, Steve, that was for the third quarter that I mentioned, a little over $1. So the fourth quarter, we expect sequential improvement just because \u2013 and given also what we've seen in geographies like in China and in Italy, we've seen a deep, call it, pullback, followed by a gradual improvement. And that is our 10% sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, which we expect to be broad-based, but with the exception of Oil & Gas where we're not projecting an improvement. Yes. Julian, if you look at our earnings conversion for the full year, and I call it core convergence, so I exclude the impact of acquisitions, which have a significant impact, and currency, for the full year, earnings conversion is a little over 35% on 8% revenue \u2013 organic revenue drop at the midpoint. For the second half, again, adjusting for the impact of currency and acquisitions, our conversion is a little bit below 40%. Julian, you're referring to the temporary actions? Got it. So the temporary actions will have a bigger impact in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter just because of the timing of our pay cuts. So that's one. If I look specifically in our January guidance, we had said investment spending would be up about 2% year-over-year. That's about $40 million. Currently, we expect that to be down 3% for the full year, and so that's a $100 million swing versus our January guidance. We think that Q3, Q4 will be down about 6%, 7% each compared to the prior year in terms of spend. And in dollar terms, it would be a little bit more in Q4 than in Q3. Yes. So the run rate of these actions, if I look at the bonus, we cannot count on that after this year, but the full run rate of the pay cuts is north of $100 million. And so we get less than half of that this year. And so there is another \u2013 that is another over $50 million call of an annualized impact if we continue that into next year. But as I said, it will depend on business conditions, whether we do so. Yes. So in the \u2013 for the balance of the year, we will have a $30 million decrease in bonus expense that will mostly fall in Q4. Yes, Nigel, Patrick here. In April, globally, and this is for both orders and ships, our product businesses are down about 20% through Friday last week. And so consistent with our projection for the third quarter, what we're seeing so far this month, and as I said, this is for products, two-thirds of our business. Nigel, of course, it's a difficult question. We've seen weakness start at the end of March. I think it's too early for us to say that in April, given where we are, that we have seen a bottom of that we call a bottom. So it's unclear when we may bottom out. We do believe that, that will be sometime in Q3 in that late this quarter. Mid or late June into the fourth quarter, we will see a sequential improvement. Yes. So specific to Q3, organic sales down about 20%. That represents well over $300 million of revenue, which is weighted towards our product businesses, which, as you know, carry higher margins. We're not getting the full run rate of our cost actions given the timing of the pay cuts. And so we expect Q3 to be the trough. So Q3, excluding the impact of acquisitions and currency, we expect our decrementals to be close to about 50% for that quarter because of the reasons I mentioned. Thank you."

Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jessica Kourakos, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Kourakos, please go ahead\nJessica Kourakos: Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call.  With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO, and Patrick Goris, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include, and our call today will reference, non-GAAP measures.  Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website, for replay, for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today\u2019s call. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our Company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. So, with that I\u2019ll hand the call over to Blake.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Jessica, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Please turn to page 3 of the slide deck. I\u2019ll begin by saying that I\u2019m pleased with our execution in the quarter and our start to the year. Despite a tough manufacturing environment, both revenue and earnings were slightly better than our expectations for Q1.  Total sales grew 3%, including over 4 points of contribution from inorganic investments primarily related to our Sensia joint venture. Organic sales were down 1% compared to a strong quarter a year ago. Backlog, however, was up year-over-year as well as sequentially.  Organic sales performance continues to include market share gains in core platforms. For instance, Independent Cart Motion Control Technology grew strong double-digits for us in the quarter. It is becoming a game-changing solution across a broad range of industries and applications.  Information Solutions and Connected Services, or IS/CS for short, had another great quarter, also growing strong double-digits. We had notable wins in Life Sciences, Food & Beverage, our first MES win in Luxury Goods, a significant MES win in Mining, and our first-ever augmented reality project in Oil & Gas.  Our broader and more differentiated portfolio gives us more ways to win in a wide variety of industries, including those where we are not the incumbent control platform. Recurring revenue in the quarter grew double digits, led by an increase in software subscriptions. As I mentioned, our earnings performance was slightly better than expected. Segment margins and adjusted EPS include one-time items related to Sensia as well as investments we are making to increase our long-term differentiation.  As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we are reaffirming our organic sales and adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal 2020. While there have been recent positive developments on global trade, and the macro environment is showing signs of stabilization, it is still too early to see that impact on customer spending.  Let\u2019s now turn to slide 4 and go a little deeper into our vertical sales performance for the quarter. Discrete and Hybrid end-market segments did a little better than we expected this quarter while Process was a little weaker than we expected.  Within our Discrete segment, Auto grew mid-single digits, largely related to higher program spend in North America and Asia Pacific, and stabilization in MRO, albeit at low levels. While this higher program spend was better than anticipated, the overall auto market is still relatively weak and we think it is premature to change our flat full year outlook for this vertical.  Semiconductor sales were notably better in all regions, up high-single digits. Historically, our exposure to semis has been largely in facilities management, but we are also seeing new traction in material handling, IOT and cybersecurity applications. Turning now to our Hybrid market segment. Food & Beverage declined low-single digits, reflecting some project delays. However, given what we are hearing from customers, and the activity we have seen at packaging OEMs, we still believe Food & Beverage will grow low-single-digits for the year. In Life Sciences, we had another solid quarter, with sales growing both year over year as well as sequentially. As we\u2019ve said before, this is an industry where our scalable architecture and our differentiation in IS/CS are well aligned and paying dividends. Our Process market segment declined slightly, especially in Chemicals and Pulp & Paper. Organically, oil & gas grew mid-single-digits this quarter and we continue to expect low-single-digits sales performance for the year. Sensia, which had a good start to the year, is expected to grow double digits based on its differentiation in the fast-growing, digital oilfield segment of this vertical. Turning to Slide 5 and our regional sales performance in the quarter. North America was down 3% organically, reflecting a weak manufacturing environment. The weakness in process industries was partially offset by Auto, up double-digits, and strength in Semiconductor. EMEA was up 2% in the quarter, led by Oil & Gas, Life Sciences, and Tire.  Asia Pacific grew by 6%, led by strong demand for Oil & Gas, Life Sciences, and Auto. Auto was up over 10% in the region and included strong gains at EV battery manufacturers where our readiness to serve is high. Our portfolio is demonstrating how well-positioned we are to benefit from the transition to EV. Latin America sales were down 1%, largely due to a tough comparison from last year and weaker performance in Automotive and Mining.  I\u2019ll now make a few additional comments on our other accomplishments in the quarter. Our Annual Automation Fair was held last November in Chicago, and I\u2019m proud to say that we reached a new all-time attendance record. Customers are focusing on outcomes, and sharply increased sales leads from the event indicate we are demonstrating our increased value for a wide variety of industries.  We also had record attendance at our Investor Day in November. There, we highlighted our execution plans to accelerate profitable long-term growth, while at the same time build even greater resiliency in our business through higher recurring revenue streams and a leaner more flexible cost structure.  We also had record attendance at our Investor Day in November. There we highlighted our execution plans to accelerate profitable long-term growth, while at the same time build even greater resiliency in our business through higher recurring revenue streams and a leaner, more flexible cost structure. We also had exciting new partners at the event, including Schlumberger, Accenture, and Ansys, which is a game-changing technology partner for simulation and digital twin applications.  We are seeing our partnerships contribute to many strategic wins and we had some great wins this quarter, including in Life Sciences across all major geographies. In Europe, we signed a major agreement with Roche. Roche will be implementing our PharmaSuite MES platform across 16 plants in their Pharma and Diagnostics divisions. In Europe, we signed a major agreement with Roche. Roche will be implementing our pharma suite MES platform across 16 plants in their Pharma and Diagnostics divisions.  In North America, we entered into a new multi-site, multi-year agreement with a major pharmaceutical producer. They selected FactoryTalk Innovation Suite to drive their Digital Transformation program for a connected plant and supply chain.  It will provide a common platform to drive real-time visibility of analytics to the operator, plant and enterprise levels, predict future events to avoid unplanned downtime and improve energy efficiency, and accelerate knowledge transfer and improve ease of use. Once implemented, this solution will eliminate hundreds of overlapping edge solutions, resulting in significant operational savings.  In China, Ruiying Pharma Group, a large pharmaceutical company, chose Rockwell to transform their factories to become smarter and more predictive, while at the same time assisting them to oversee quality management and ensuring that they comply with regulatory requirements.  From regulatory compliance, to safety and energy efficiency, Rockwell is becoming an increasingly important partner of our customers\u2019 ESG initiatives. In addition to what we are doing in our own facilities, everything we do for customers is about increasing efficiency, reducing energy usage, improving worker safety, and ensuring regulatory compliance, all of which lowers business risk and is good for the environment.  Now, turning to slide 6, let\u2019s talk a little more about our inorganic investments which are becoming an increasingly important complement to our long-term organic growth strategy. Starting with Sensia, this was our first quarter including Sensia as a fully operational joint venture consolidated in our results, and I am very pleased with its performance in Q1.  Operationally, Sensia\u2019s top line grew double digits with strong traction at marquis Oil & Gas customers around the world. Our sales teams have been fully integrated, and we are looking forward to the launch of new solutions and products that will contribute to the double-digit sales performance we expect this year.  We also announced the acquisition of MESTECH at the beginning of Q1. MESTECH is an industrial software consulting and delivery services company based in India, and they have already been instrumental in winning key business for us in the quarter.  Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of Avnet Data Security, a cybersecurity provider based in Israel with over 20 years of experience. Cybersecurity is one of the fastest growing parts of our services business. The extensive knowledge and experience of the Avnet team will support our company's strategic objective to achieve double-digit growth in Information Solutions and Connected Services by expanding our IT/OT cyber and network expertise globally.  Plus, this acquisition will establish a global cybersecurity Center of Excellence for us in EMEA. This includes a remote managed service center and expands our portfolio of capabilities including a full training curriculum and labs. As you can see, we are actively deploying capital to advance our strategic priorities to accelerate share gains in our core business, continue growing double digits in IS/CS, grow domain expertise in process, and accelerate our market access in Europe and Asia. We are focused on driving value with more intensity than ever before.  Let me now turn it over to Patrick who will elaborate on our first quarter financial performance and fiscal 2020 outlook in his remarks. Patrick?\nPatrick Goris : Thank you, Blake, and good morning everyone.  I\u2019ll start on slide 7, First Quarter Key Financial Information. First quarter reported sales were up 2.6% year over year. As expected, organic sales were down 1%. Acquisitions, which mainly represent the impact of Sensia, contributed 4.5 points of growth, better than expected. Currency translation decreased sales by 0.9 points, a higher headwind than we expected. Segment operating margin was 20.1%, down 270 basis points compared to last year. About half of the year-over-year decrease relates to the impact of acquisitions and related one-time costs, primarily Sensia. The other half of the year-over-year margin decrease is about evenly split between higher investment spending and unfavorable mix.  General Corporate \u2013 net expense of $32.8 million was up $11 million compared to last year. The increase is due to the impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our deferred and non-qualified compensation plans and Sensia-related transaction fees.  The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 7.9% compared to 18.7% last year. About half of the reduction in the year-over-year tax rate is due to a Sensia $19 million one-time tax benefit. The remainder is other discrete items, primarily tax benefits from option exercises.  Adjusted EPS of $2.11 was a bit better than we expected, and down $0.10 compared to the first quarter of last year, a decrease of 5%. The year-over-year decrease in Adjusted EPS is primarily due to lower organic sales, particularly in some of our product businesses leading to unfavorable mix, and higher investment spending.  Partially offsetting that is a lower tax rate excluding the Sensia impacts, and the net benefit of a lower share count and higher net interest expense. The net year-over-year adjusted EPS contribution of Sensia in the quarter was one penny.  The Sensia contribution of one penny includes a $0.07 larger-than-expected headwind related to one-time items. Free Cash Flow was $194 million in the quarter, or about 80% of Adjusted Income. During the quarter, we paid the annual bonus that our employees earned in fiscal 2019.  A few additional items not shown on the slide: for Adjusted EPS, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 116.6 million, down 4.9 million or about 4% from last year. We repurchased about 0.5 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $100 million. This is in line with our full year target of about $400 million. At December 31st, we had $1 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization  Slide 8 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our operating segments. The Architecture & Software segment had modest organic growth in the quarter. Segment margin was very strong at 29.8% and a bit lower than the record margin last year, mainly due to increased investment spending.  Organic sales of the Control Products & Solutions segment decreased 2.5%. Inorganic investments increased sales by 8.2% compared to last year. Sensia accounts for almost all of the inorganic growth. Organic sales for our solutions and services businesses in this segment was down about half a point year-over-year. The higher margin product businesses in this segment were down about 5% on an organic basis. First quarter organic book to bill performance for our solutions and services businesses was 1.12, typical for a first quarter. Operating margin for this segment of 12.4% was down 310 basis points compared to Q1 last year, primarily due to Sensia one-time items, lower organic sales, and unfavorable mix. Segment margin excluding the year over year impact of Sensia was about 14%.  In the appendix, you will find two slides with a more detailed overview of the year-over-year incremental impact of Sensia for Q1 and for full year fiscal 2020 outlook. It is the same format we provided to you at our investor day.  As I mentioned earlier, from an operational viewpoint, Sensia sales and earnings were a bit better than we expected. Non-recurring items, including the tax benefit, were $0.07 worse than we expected in the first quarter, primarily due to larger purchase accounting adjustments and a lower tax benefit. For full year fiscal 2020, we now expect the net year-over-year impact of Sensia to be about neutral to adjusted EPS. The financial framework we shared with you at investor day last November remains valid with Sensia. We continue to target 30 to 35% earnings conversion for Rockwell assuming mid-single-digit organic sales growth.  This takes us to slide 9, guidance. Our outlook for fiscal 2020 remains unchanged compared to our November guidance. We are maintaining our sales growth and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. For adjusted EPS, in essence, compared to prior guidance, small headwinds due to Sensia one-time items, currency, and a higher share count are offset by a somewhat lower adjusted effective tax rate. The lower tax rate is the result of a higher excess income tax benefit related to share-based compensation. General corporate net is now expected to be closer to $105 million. Purchase accounting amortization expense for the full year is expected to be about $40 million, up $20 million compared to last year. Net interest expense for fiscal 2020 is still expected to be about $100 million. We expect non-controlling-Interest to be about $10 million, or a $0.10 charge to Adjusted EPS. Average diluted share count is now expected to be 116.5 million for fiscal 2020, and our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be closer to 15.5%, which includes about a 150 basis point one-time benefit related to Sensia. We continue to project free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. Finally, we continue to project a weaker first half of the year, with organic sales down low single digits, followed by a stronger second half of the year. And as is typical for us, we expect weaker 2nd quarter Adjusted EPS performance versus the first quarter.  With that, I\u2019ll hand it to Jessica to start Q&A. \nJessica Kourakos: Thanks, Patrick. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you in as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Sharon, let\u2019s take our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. \nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning everyone. This is Joe on for Julian. \nBlake Moret: Good morning.\nUnidentified Analyst: Maybe can we start with diving into backlog trends? Can you maybe just provide some color on what drove the sequential rise and the year-over-year rise? And then, maybe within that, anymore details on Solutions and Services?\nBlake Moret: Sure, how much more color we can provided except that as we mentioned, backlogs are up both year-over-year and sequentially, and I would say it was broad based including in North America. \nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you. And then, at the end-market level, kind of on the mid-single-digit growth for oil and gas, was this on kind of company-specific drivers, maybe share gains? Or are you seeing kind of more positives in the end-market as a whole?\nBlake Moret: On the organic side, there obviously has been a flattish capital spending and we do see a slower \u2013 a slowing of the oil and gas organically. However, on the Sensia joint venture, because the majority of that is focused on producing wells and not drilling new wells, we see it less susceptible to CapEx reductions and that gives us confidence based on our first quarter results and the outlook that double-digits impact part of our overall oil and gas business can take share and grow fast. \nUnidentified Analyst: Perfect. Thank you.\nBlake Moret: Okay, thank you. \nOperator: Next question comes from John Inch with Gordon Haskett. \nKaren Lau: Hi, good morning. It\u2019s Karen Lau dialing in for John. \nBlake Moret: Good morning, Karen. \nKaren Lau: Good morning. So, thank you for the details on Sensia in the appendix. I was just wondering in terms of the core margins, it looks like, you guys were making 18% core margins excluding the one-time items in the first quarter, but then in the full year you are guiding to around 14% margins. What is the driver of that?\nPatrick Goris: Yes, what you can think about it, Karen, what you see in the appendix is the year-over-year incremental piece of Sensia. It\u2019s the impact of the contribution of Schlumberger, which was higher margin business than what we contributed. \nKaren Lau: Okay. \nPatrick Goris: And so, therefore, when we talk about overall margin profile of Sensia, we do expect that the 20% EBITDA business going forward. But this year, we think it will be closer to mid-teens. \nKaren Lau: Okay. But is it \u2013 I mean, am I reading correctly that the first quarter results were better than what you were expecting for the full year? Or is that like some\u2026\nPatrick Goris:  But the piece that was contributed by Schlumberger and the synergy, the answer to that is, yes. I would also say that our spend increased in Sensia, because we are making some investments in technology and commercial resources. They were a little bit lighter in the first quarter than we expected. That\u2019s why you see that margin in Q1 being a little bit better, as well than what you see for the full year outlook. \nKaren Lau: Got it. And then, just quickly, can you remind us what\u2019s your expectation for investment spending for the year? And kind of the cadence throughout the year?\nPatrick Goris: Yes, the way you can think about it, Karen is, consistent with what I mentioned to you in November. We think the year-over-year increase will be a little bit less than a 2% and it will be first half weighted. And so, we expect it to be more than that in the first half and in the second half, the increase year-over-year will be minimum in terms of year-over-year spend.\nKaren Lau: Got it. Thank you. \nPatrick Goris: Thank you, Karen. \nOperator: Next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stephens. \nRobert McCarthy : Hi, it\u2019s Robert McCarthy on for Robert McCarthy. \nBlake Moret: Hey, Rob. \nRobert McCarthy : How are you doing? So, in any event, just wanted to first, I mean, obviously wasn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s very dynamic situation right now. You had the trade deal. You had very encouraging quarter, but obviously you had this rising potentials of pandemic, and then I want to get too much of a Debbie Downer.  But how do you think about kind of your supply chain in China, how do you think about, kind of the trends in spillover? I know it\u2019s very early and you don\u2019t have a lot of information yet, but could you just give us some factors to think about and what sensitivities you are looking at in terms of exposures as you manage to this situation? \nBlake Moret: Sure. Well, first of all, Rob, the overwhelming first priority for us is to ensure that we are looking after our people in the region. And so, we are paying close attention to that to make sure that we can reduce to the very extent possible their exposure.  Second, and on a parallel path, we are undergoing a detailed review of our own manufacturing footprint, as well as our supply base to gauge the potential impacts. At this point, we don\u2019t expect an impact to the quarter\u2019s performance, but as you said, it\u2019s a very dynamic situation and we are monitoring it hourly and looking for new inputs to help inform how we feel about the business impacts. But it\u2019s the safety and well-being of our employees first. \nRobert McCarthy : Thank you for that. And then, I guess the follow-up would be, maybe just a little more color around Information Solutions and Connected Services, the continued double-digit growth there. Can you talk about, kind of the continued developments and collaboration with PTC, some of the wins and maybe expand your comments around augmented reality? And I don\u2019t know track and trace is something that\u2019s started to pick-up there or is looking to be encouraging.\nBlake Moret: Yes, Rob, it\u2019s a great story for us and with our own offerings that we\u2019ve developed ourselves, plus with partners like PTC, the Information Solutions and Connected Services part of our offering continues to grow strong double-digits and we are seeing that it\u2019s a true differentiator in some of the fastest growing parts of the overall automation market like electric vehicles and life sciences.  So, it works perfectly to complement the basic automation that we are providing in those industries whether it\u2019s discrete automotive assembly or it\u2019s process control for pharma, but as they are looking for more traceability, as they are looking for adding the ability to transfer knowledge from older workers to newer workers, augmented reality is a great part of that.  We have mentioned before, about a third of our sales of the software in this space include augmented reality. So it all works together. It\u2019s increasing the hit rate for our MES software, because we have a broader portfolio and it works together well. So, there is a lot of positives in this respect. And I should mention it\u2019s not just for end-users.  It\u2019s also for OEMs, because they are looking for increasing the value of what they are providing and as they look for ways to increase their flexibility getting closer to that zero changeover time for packaging that is hard in the industry today.  Then this has a lot of benefit for them, as well. We had a win in the quarter with Harpak, who you heard from us at the Investor Day in November as they are adding that software to the basic logics control and variable speed drives and so on as part of the basic automation of those systems.  And then as a final point, we have seen, probably a higher degree of adoption of this software on top of competitive control platforms than we originally thought would happen. \nRobert McCarthy : Thanks for your time. \nBlake Moret: Thanks, Rob. \nPatrick Goris: Thanks, Rob. \nOperator: Next question comes from Richard Eastman with Baird. \nRichard Eastman : Yes, good morning. Thank you for the questions. Blake, could you kind of speak, maybe to the geographic mix, the organic growth by geography in the quarter? And it just \u2013 it seems a bit scattered here. I mean, I presume, Asia was probably better than expected. U.S. maybe a little bit weaker. But how does the incoming backlog being up quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year?  How does that filter into maybe the geographic growth that you expect for the full year against the \u2013 kind of that midpoint of flat expectation for all of Rock?\nBlake Moret: Yes, let me start with a couple of comments and then Patrick may have got some additional color on that. But as I said, Asia was better than expected. Latin America was worse than expected. North America and EMEA were pretty much in line with expectations. In North America, as we mentioned, we were down by 3% and that was largely due to declines in more process-oriented verticals with the exception of oil and gas.  So, we saw chemical, pulp and paper and metals, and then that was offset by the growth we mentioned in automotive, power and semiconductor. EMEA was up and oil and gas was a contributor there along with a recurrent theme of life sciences. Waste water was a good area for us in EMEA and in Asia, we were up with growth in oil and gas, life sciences, auto, tire and mass transit.  And then, LATAM was down a little bit where weakness in auto and mining was partially offset by growth in power, oil and gas and life sciences. So, that was kind of a rundown of what we saw in Q1. In terms of how the backlog feathers into that, obviously, mainly project, but also with some of the higher value services as well, particularly those included with the Connected Services part of IS/CS. \nPatrick Goris: Rick, maybe a little bit of color as to our assumptions by region for the full year. So, organic growth at the midpoint is flat year-over-year. We expect both the \u2013 both North America and EMEA to be a little bit below that and we expect both Latin America and Asia to be up a little less than 5%, about mid-single-digits. \nRichard Eastman : Okay. And \u2026\nPatrick Goris: So, what - but that inflected as we expect in essence better than our guidance, we expect second half of the year as I mentioned improvement and that includes the U.S., I would say, North America. \nRichard Eastman : Okay. And was there any noticeable impacts on the backlog and order flow around passage of the U.S. MCA when you are talking about Latin America and Mexico? Was there any noteworthy improvement in bookings or anything once that uncertainty was more or less lifted?\nBlake Moret: Not yet, is the short answer. I mean, it\u2019s a positive step and supporting the concept of free and fair trade that we\u2019ve talked a lot about in the past. So we think it\u2019s a good thing. But we haven\u2019t seen the results on outperformance yet. \nRichard Eastman : Okay. Very good. Thank you. \nBlake Moret: Thank you. \nOperator: Next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.\nNoah Kaye : Thank you. t I was intrigued, Blake, because you call out ESG as a potential driving force for your customers to implement your suite of offerings. Conceptually, I think we can understand that, there is a basic efficiency play here that plays in ESG. Could you maybe provide some examples of where you are seeing that make a material difference in customers\u2019 decisions?\nBlake Moret: Well, as you said, everything we do is about productivity and a huge part of that productivity is efficiency. So, you take our power control offering, variable speed drives, which reduce dramatically the amount of energy that\u2019s required to run industrial processes, tremendous amount of the world\u2019s energy is consumed in factories and simply, not running full across the line when you don\u2019t need it saves a ton of energy and our variable speed drives, low-voltage and medium-voltage continue to be a very strong part of our offering.  Specifically, in the new eco industrial segment that we introduced in November, talking about our support of renewable of water and waste water treatment and mass transit, those are all industries that reduce the amount of energy that are required and it was no coincidence that we created that new segment, because we are going to be doing more in that space.  And then finally, safety, that\u2019s something we\u2019ve talked a lot about in the past and in terms of the technology to be able to automate safety, but also the services that we provided, that\u2019s an important part of ESG. We think that we are number one in the world when you pull all the discrete and process safety technology together, and that remains a really important area for us. \nNoah Kaye : That\u2019s helpful. And then, maybe drilling into auto a little bit, as you said it surprised the upside, and you gave some good color around some regional patterns there in your prepared remarks.  But just, the outlook for kind of, soft overall light vehicle demand, is that having any impact as far as you can tell on kind of the backlog the longer cycle business in terms of OEM plans to bring new models to market or planned model changeovers? How are you thinking about that? \nBlake Moret: Well we \u2013 we are guiding to about flat currently with the auto - overall automotive segment for the year. I\u2019d say the growth is highest in the specific EV drivetrain portion of the segment as people have bring in that capacity online whether it\u2019s the brand owner or it\u2019s the tier supplier, and by the way that contributed a lot to our performance.  That was a little better than expectations and if you want it was battery assembly that was a specific bright spot for there. That\u2019s offset to some extent by the reality of a weaker star count for fewer vehicles than we saw a couple years ago being bought. Certainly, a lot of the brand owners are reducing their Sedan portfolio.  But there is still a fair bit of project spend there and in the - particularly in the SUV side of things. And the growth that we saw in the quarter was primarily due to project spend, MRO stabilized, but we didn't see any real growth in MRO in the quarter. \nNoah Kaye : That's helpful color. Thanks, Blake. \nBlake Moret: Yes. Thanks, Noah. \nOperator: Next question comes from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. \nSteve Tusa: Hey guys. Good morning. \nBlake Moret: Good morning, Steve. \nSteve Tusa: Can you just talk about a little bit more about what you're seeing on the food and beverage side and OEM? And then on maybe just a bit of color on how you see, kind of quarterly organic progressing maybe move through the rest of the year?\nBlake Moret: Sure, I'll start with the food and beverage. We did see some delays in food. But one of the bright spots and I mentioned it is, we actually saw mid-single-digit growth in packaging OEMs. And it\u2019s early but that\u2019s sometimes a leading indicator as people are putting packaging in place and we did see that across the regions.  We also heard anecdotally from the packaging OEMs that their backlog is fairly good. And so those are encouraging signs. One area of particular strength for us \u2013 it\u2019s small but it is still noteworthy India packaging OEMs and I say it\u2019s is noteworthy because India maybe the most competitive market in the world and for us to have a success there is a really younger testament to the functionality and the ability to get to competitive levels there.  I was actually there in visit with some customers including some packaging OEMs in December. And I think there is some great opportunities there and we are going to continue to look at what we can do to grow our presence even faster in the Indian market. But in general, packaging OEMs were up.  We also saw some strength, specifically in beverage. We had a real nice conversion at a beverage OEM that\u2019s going to a well-known beverage user and so that was also good in the quarter. \nSteve Tusa: And then you said, quarterly, yes, progression on organic?\nPatrick Goris: Yes, see, for the full year, we remain at 0% organic growth. Obviously, Q1, we did minus 1. I would say, Q2, low, low-single-digits, meaning it\u2019s close to what we did in Q1. We don\u2019t expect it to get worse than what we did in Q1 and then for the balance of the year, I\u2019d say, Q4 organic growth a little bit better than Q3. \nSteve Tusa: Okay. So, it seems to me that like, how do you get to kind of the low-end of the range than if that\u2019s the case? I mean\u2026\nPatrick Goris: What I was providing was at the midpoint, Steve. \nSteve Tusa: Yes. Okay, got it. \nBlake Moret: The trend that I think we have seen in the past with chemical and we did see that is the single largest contributor in the quarter. That was primarily in North America, we actually saw an increase in chemical in EMEA, down in Asia, and slightly down in Latin America. So, is it\u2019s offset?  As we mentioned, we actually saw a growth in oil and gas, but the chemical was down in the quarter and most of that was concentrated in North America.\nSteve Tusa: Thanks. \nPatrick Goris: As we said in the earlier, within Process, oil and gas was up. But generally, process industries were weak in the quarter. \nSteve Tusa: Great. \nBlake Moret: I would also mention, just for background that, in chemical lot of our exposure in specialty chemical. It\u2019s not as much in the bulk chemical. That\u2019s our traditional focus. There is some overcapacity that we are currently seeing in chemical and some effects from some of the consolidation that\u2019s been going on in the industry over the last couple of years as well. So that\u2019s some additional color that would certainly apply to North America. \nSteve Tusa: That\u2019s great. Very helpful. And then just a quick one just on EV. I know, you said you had strong gains there during the quarter. I am just wondering if you can talk about China EV specifically and what you have been seeing there? Any changes? \nPatrick Goris: Yes, so, China \u2013 auto in China has been down Q3, Q4 of last year and we saw that continue into the first quarter of fiscal 2020. And that includes EVs. And so we are seeing some of the support or the subsidies go away in China and generally, and obviously it\u2019s still a little bit lumpy, because it\u2019s relatively small,  But EV and auto in general, we are certainly seeing some weakness in China. Interestingly, auto in Asia was up for us quite a bit and the reason there we are making some progress with some of the EV companies outside of China including some companies in Korea for example. \nBlake Moret: Yes, and that\u2019s specific application that Patrick is mentioning in Korea was the battery assembly, which is a great application for us. We have mentioned before that, in comparison to the subtractive manufacturing processes for internal combustion engines, now for boring cylinders and things like that that require a lot of CNC content. Battery assembly and motor winding and EV drivetrain, we have a high readiness to serve there and that\u2019s why we think that long-term EV is a great market for us to be in. \nSteve Tusa: That\u2019s great. Thank you very much for your time. \nBlake Moret: Yes. Thank you.\nPatrick Goris: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nJosh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning all. \nPatrick Goris: Good morning, Josh. \nBlake Moret: Hey, Josh. \nJosh Pokrzywinski : So, apologies if I missed it earlier on the call. But, Blake, one thing that we talked about at the Analyst Day that I want to see how that is playing out is, it\u2019s kind of the lower cyclicality of Rockwell maybe versus what folks would have been accustomed to five or ten years ago or even more that it does seem like at a point in time whether folks are seeing kind of a more depressed outlook that Rockwell is hanging in there a bit more stable.  I guess, one, is that consistent with the way you guys are seeing the world? And two, is there kind of a coiled spring on the back-end where you can see customers have a willingness to spend on projects, but there maybe not executing it. So, have we lost some of that upward mobility in exchange for lower cyclicality? \nBlake Moret: Yes, I wouldn\u2019t draw that the causality between the two. But as we talked about a lot in November, that greater resiliency to economic cycles is something that we are making very explicit steps to address. And so, in addition to things like Information Solutions and Connected Services providing a lot of increased value to customers and pulling through some of our traditional products.  It does have an impact that we think is already being felt in terms of kind of clipping the trough of some of the normal volatility. Now it\u2019s still a relatively small part of our business, right? But that\u2019s compounding a strong double-digit growth, plus what we do with acquisitions having more recurring revenue makes it more important each year and last year.  We think \u2013 for instance, Information Solutions and Connected Services having about a point of organic growth to what we did and you know in a relatively low growth year overall, that\u2019s meaningful.  So, we are going to continue to work on that in terms of both our organic development, the products and the environment to be able to manage recurring revenue. But it\u2019s also a consideration as we look for companies to acquire and the percentage of recurring revenue. \nJosh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just a follow-up on investment. Again, apologies if you covered already. It seems like some of that got pulled forward into the first quarter as maybe demand was a little bit better than expected.  How should we think about the sensitivity from here on kind of that full year investment budget? Is it at a healthy level to where if you are at the top-end of the revenue range that the overall bucket doesn\u2019t increase? Or how are you thinking about the sensitivity over the remaining three quarters? Thanks. \nPatrick Goris: Yes, Josh. So, what we mentioned was that the spending in the \u2013 the year-over-year increase in the first half will be higher than in the second half. Actually, the second half the way we have it dialed in now is the flattish from a year-over-year spend point of view. However, if, depending on what happens with our outlook for the year, and if we end up doing better what we do at the midpoint.  Clearly, we could decide to release more investments. There is a very long list of attractive investments that we are looking through all the time and we could decide to do more. \nJosh Pokrzywinski : Okay. Thanks for the color.\nPatrick Goris: Thank you. \nOperator: Next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe : Thanks, good morning. Appreciate the question. I know you covered a lot of ground already. But and I know we tend to focus more on the end-market out. So I am just wondering about the geographies and thinking about how geographically, things are playing out relative to your initial kind of guidance in November. In particular, North America, down 3.3% this quarter and I know that North America has been trending weak for some time now.  But with ISM where it is and IP negative, how does that look in North America specifically compared to your initial kind of outlook? And kind of what\u2019s bouncing against that if it is weaker than you expected?\nBlake Moret: Yes, so, as you said, the macro can generally be characterized as weak and there was some downward revisions. And our position to that is some of the backlog that was built in the first quarter and some of the things.  Again like the IS and CS, the Information Solutions and Connected Services backdrop aren\u2019t going to be as coupled directly to some of the broader indicators, if in those areas, we can demonstrate a relatively quick return on that investment, which is often from OpEx then we think that that\u2019s going to be more resilient than some of the other more capital-related spending. \nPatrick Goris: Yes, and then, Nigel, for Q1, we would say that North America and EMEA came in basically in line with our expectations. Asia-Pacific came in better and Latin America came in weaker. And for the full year, compare estimate point, we think that North America and EMEA will be down a bit and we think that Asia-Pacific and Latin America will be up mid-single-digits at a less than 5%. \nNigel Coe : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Patrick. And then a quick one on obviously A&S is holding up a lot better through the soft patch than we\u2019ve seen historically. And I know it\u2019s also flowing through the IS layer, but can you just maybe \u2013 is there any way to quantify kind of the relationship with PTC and how that\u2019s helping to \u2013 maybe improve the trough performance of A&S? And any color there would be helpful.\nBlake Moret: Yes, I made a general comment to that and that is, manufacturing - advanced manufacturing is becoming a much more noteworthy part of a company\u2019s overall digital transformation plans. So we see companies like Stanley Black & Decker, as they talk about fairly significant reductions in cost they're being asked to go a little deeper and explain how they are going to get there and we are finding ourselves apart of those explanations as to how we are going to be able to reduce OpEx for these companies.  By having the relationship with PTC and having that increasingly important in IS/CS offering, we are going to have those broad discussions at a higher level than if we were just talking about programmable controller performance or some of the other elements of basic automation.  So it allows us to get higher in the organization and deploy a meaningful part of those overall discussions whereas if we didn\u2019t have that kind of breadth, then we might find ourselves playing a little more deep ends in some of the core components.  So that\u2019s at a high level how a partnership with a company like PTC will pull through some performance in the core products, because they all go together, that basic automation and then the information that sits on top of it to draw insights from the data that\u2019s born in our products. \nNigel Coe : Okay. Thanks, Blake. \nBlake Moret: Thanks, Nigel. \nJessica Kourakos: Sharon, we will take one more question. \nOperator: We have a question from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. \nAndrew Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning guys. \nPatrick Goris: Good morning, Andy. \nAndrew Kaplowitz : Thanks for letting me in. Blake, you might have talked about this earlier, but on Sensia, you mentioned that operating performance was better than expected. Maybe you could just talk about \u2013 give a little more color on what that means? Obviously, there is a lot of moving pieces with Sensia in the guide that you gave last quarter for the year.  I think you talked about $0.05 excluding interest. Could it be better than that in 2020?\nBlake Moret: Yes, I mean, we are pushing the team, obviously to perform as if they are in an open field because we think they are. We think that what they are offering is somewhat unique in the market and our original hypothesis that there was a low level of basic automation in the oilfield, particularly the onshore oilfield is proving to be true.  So that things that we are talking about as we are selling the traditional offerings into that space of things like measurement, devices, as well as artificial lift and so on, the ability to commence and to weave that together is really meeting with a lot of interest and some of these are our existing customers, but customers that in the past have bought the products as needed from us.  But now they are saying that we can play a much more significant part in their overall strategy. And I had a chance to talk with some of these customers over the last year in Latin America and in Europe and we are excited and even more excited after the first quarter\u2019s results, because these companies are voting with their wallets.  And again, it\u2019s a solutions-based approach. It\u2019s the measurement devices, it\u2019s the artificial lifts, it\u2019s the software and then it\u2019s the delivery capability to bring this all together to reduce their cost to produce a barrel of oil. \nAndrew Kaplowitz : And Blake, I just wanted I just wanted to follow-up on your comment on Latin America. A, is the incremental weakness or the moderation that that you saw really focused on mining and/or just tough comparisons, there has been a little bit of unrest down there. You just mentioned oil and gas pretty strong. So, just what have seen down there?\nBlake Moret: Yes, so, mechanically, we still have some tough comps against that big Codelco project in mining that we've talked about over the last year or so. And that project is going very well by the way. In general, in Latin America, we saw modest growth in Mexico and Brazil, but it was offset by weakness in Argentina and Chile and of course a good component of that would be mining-related.  Mexico was up low-single-digits and Brazil was also up low-single-digits. So, I think you are right that some of it is comps. We expect mining to be about flat for the year in Latin America.\nAndrew Kaplowitz : Thanks, Blake. \nBlake Moret: Yes. \nPatrick Goris: Thank you, Andy. \nOperator: And at this time, I will turn the call over to Ms. Kourakos. \nJessica Kourakos: Thank you, Sharon. I\u2019ll turn it back to Blake for few final comments.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Jessica. As we have been discussing, I am happy to see our new offerings delivering significantly increased value. We\u2019ve never been better positioned with a more differentiated offering as the convergence of IT and OT creates tremendous new opportunities. And our employees and partners they continue to set us apart and we are really excited about the journey ahead. \nJessica Kourakos: Okay. That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s conference call. At this time, you may now disconnect. Thank you.",

            "name": "Blake Moret",
            "content": "Thanks, Jessica, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Please turn to page 3 of the slide deck. I'll begin by saying that I'm pleased with our execution in the quarter and our start to the year. Despite a tough manufacturing environment, both revenue and earnings were slightly better than our expectations for Q1.  Total sales grew 3%, including over 4 points of contribution from inorganic investments primarily related to our Sensia joint venture. Organic sales were down 1% compared to a strong quarter a year ago. Backlog, however, was up year-over-year as well as sequentially.  Organic sales performance continues to include market share gains in core platforms. For instance, Independent Cart Motion Control Technology grew strong double-digits for us in the quarter. It is becoming a game-changing solution across a broad range of industries and applications.  Information Solutions and Connected Services, or IS/CS for short, had another great quarter, also growing strong double-digits. We had notable wins in Life Sciences, Food & Beverage, our first MES win in Luxury Goods, a significant MES win in Mining, and our first-ever augmented reality project in Oil & Gas.  Our broader and more differentiated portfolio gives us more ways to win in a wide variety of industries, including those where we are not the incumbent control platform. Recurring revenue in the quarter grew double digits, led by an increase in software subscriptions. As I mentioned, our earnings performance was slightly better than expected. Segment margins and adjusted EPS include one-time items related to Sensia as well as investments we are making to increase our long-term differentiation.  As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we are reaffirming our organic sales and adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal 2020. While there have been recent positive developments on global trade, and the macro environment is showing signs of stabilization, it is still too early to see that impact on customer spending.  Let's now turn to slide 4 and go a little deeper into our vertical sales performance for the quarter. Discrete and Hybrid end-market segments did a little better than we expected this quarter while Process was a little weaker than we expected.  Within our Discrete segment, Auto grew mid-single digits, largely related to higher program spend in North America and Asia Pacific, and stabilization in MRO, albeit at low levels. While this higher program spend was better than anticipated, the overall auto market is still relatively weak and we think it is premature to change our flat full year outlook for this vertical.  Semiconductor sales were notably better in all regions, up high-single digits. Historically, our exposure to semis has been largely in facilities management, but we are also seeing new traction in material handling, IOT and cybersecurity applications. Turning now to our Hybrid market segment. Food & Beverage declined low-single digits, reflecting some project delays. However, given what we are hearing from customers, and the activity we have seen at packaging OEMs, we still believe Food & Beverage will grow low-single-digits for the year. In Life Sciences, we had another solid quarter, with sales growing both year over year as well as sequentially. As we've said before, this is an industry where our scalable architecture and our differentiation in IS/CS are well aligned and paying dividends. Our Process market segment declined slightly, especially in Chemicals and Pulp & Paper. Organically, oil & gas grew mid-single-digits this quarter and we continue to expect low-single-digits sales performance for the year. Sensia, which had a good start to the year, is expected to grow double digits based on its differentiation in the fast-growing, digital oilfield segment of this vertical. Turning to Slide 5 and our regional sales performance in the quarter. North America was down 3% organically, reflecting a weak manufacturing environment. The weakness in process industries was partially offset by Auto, up double-digits, and strength in Semiconductor. EMEA was up 2% in the quarter, led by Oil & Gas, Life Sciences, and Tire.  Asia Pacific grew by 6%, led by strong demand for Oil & Gas, Life Sciences, and Auto. Auto was up over 10% in the region and included strong gains at EV battery manufacturers where our readiness to serve is high. Our portfolio is demonstrating how well-positioned we are to benefit from the transition to EV. Latin America sales were down 1%, largely due to a tough comparison from last year and weaker performance in Automotive and Mining.  I'll now make a few additional comments on our other accomplishments in the quarter. Our Annual Automation Fair was held last November in Chicago, and I'm proud to say that we reached a new all-time attendance record. Customers are focusing on outcomes, and sharply increased sales leads from the event indicate we are demonstrating our increased value for a wide variety of industries.  We also had record attendance at our Investor Day in November. There, we highlighted our execution plans to accelerate profitable long-term growth, while at the same time build even greater resiliency in our business through higher recurring revenue streams and a leaner more flexible cost structure.  We also had record attendance at our Investor Day in November. There we highlighted our execution plans to accelerate profitable long-term growth, while at the same time build even greater resiliency in our business through higher recurring revenue streams and a leaner, more flexible cost structure. We also had exciting new partners at the event, including Schlumberger, Accenture, and Ansys, which is a game-changing technology partner for simulation and digital twin applications.  We are seeing our partnerships contribute to many strategic wins and we had some great wins this quarter, including in Life Sciences across all major geographies. In Europe, we signed a major agreement with Roche. Roche will be implementing our PharmaSuite MES platform across 16 plants in their Pharma and Diagnostics divisions. In Europe, we signed a major agreement with Roche. Roche will be implementing our pharma suite MES platform across 16 plants in their Pharma and Diagnostics divisions.  In North America, we entered into a new multi-site, multi-year agreement with a major pharmaceutical producer. They selected FactoryTalk Innovation Suite to drive their Digital Transformation program for a connected plant and supply chain.  It will provide a common platform to drive real-time visibility of analytics to the operator, plant and enterprise levels, predict future events to avoid unplanned downtime and improve energy efficiency, and accelerate knowledge transfer and improve ease of use. Once implemented, this solution will eliminate hundreds of overlapping edge solutions, resulting in significant operational savings.  In China, Ruiying Pharma Group, a large pharmaceutical company, chose Rockwell to transform their factories to become smarter and more predictive, while at the same time assisting them to oversee quality management and ensuring that they comply with regulatory requirements.  From regulatory compliance, to safety and energy efficiency, Rockwell is becoming an increasingly important partner of our customers' ESG initiatives. In addition to what we are doing in our own facilities, everything we do for customers is about increasing efficiency, reducing energy usage, improving worker safety, and ensuring regulatory compliance, all of which lowers business risk and is good for the environment.  Now, turning to slide 6, let's talk a little more about our inorganic investments which are becoming an increasingly important complement to our long-term organic growth strategy. Starting with Sensia, this was our first quarter including Sensia as a fully operational joint venture consolidated in our results, and I am very pleased with its performance in Q1.  Operationally, Sensia's top line grew double digits with strong traction at marquis Oil & Gas customers around the world. Our sales teams have been fully integrated, and we are looking forward to the launch of new solutions and products that will contribute to the double-digit sales performance we expect this year.  We also announced the acquisition of MESTECH at the beginning of Q1. MESTECH is an industrial software consulting and delivery services company based in India, and they have already been instrumental in winning key business for us in the quarter.  Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of Avnet Data Security, a cybersecurity provider based in Israel with over 20 years of experience. Cybersecurity is one of the fastest growing parts of our services business. The extensive knowledge and experience of the Avnet team will support our company's strategic objective to achieve double-digit growth in Information Solutions and Connected Services by expanding our IT/OT cyber and network expertise globally.  Plus, this acquisition will establish a global cybersecurity Center of Excellence for us in EMEA. This includes a remote managed service center and expands our portfolio of capabilities including a full training curriculum and labs. As you can see, we are actively deploying capital to advance our strategic priorities to accelerate share gains in our core business, continue growing double digits in IS/CS, grow domain expertise in process, and accelerate our market access in Europe and Asia. We are focused on driving value with more intensity than ever before.  Let me now turn it over to Patrick who will elaborate on our first quarter financial performance and fiscal 2020 outlook in his remarks. Patrick? Good morning. Sure, how much more color we can provided except that as we mentioned, backlogs are up both year-over-year and sequentially, and I would say it was broad based including in North America. On the organic side, there obviously has been a flattish capital spending and we do see a slower \u2013 a slowing of the oil and gas organically. However, on the Sensia joint venture, because the majority of that is focused on producing wells and not drilling new wells, we see it less susceptible to CapEx reductions and that gives us confidence based on our first quarter results and the outlook that double-digits impact part of our overall oil and gas business can take share and grow fast. Okay, thank you. Good morning, Karen. Hey, Rob. Sure. Well, first of all, Rob, the overwhelming first priority for us is to ensure that we are looking after our people in the region. And so, we are paying close attention to that to make sure that we can reduce to the very extent possible their exposure.  Second, and on a parallel path, we are undergoing a detailed review of our own manufacturing footprint, as well as our supply base to gauge the potential impacts. At this point, we don't expect an impact to the quarter's performance, but as you said, it's a very dynamic situation and we are monitoring it hourly and looking for new inputs to help inform how we feel about the business impacts. But it's the safety and well-being of our employees first. Yes, Rob, it's a great story for us and with our own offerings that we've developed ourselves, plus with partners like PTC, the Information Solutions and Connected Services part of our offering continues to grow strong double-digits and we are seeing that it's a true differentiator in some of the fastest growing parts of the overall automation market like electric vehicles and life sciences.  So, it works perfectly to complement the basic automation that we are providing in those industries whether it's discrete automotive assembly or it's process control for pharma, but as they are looking for more traceability, as they are looking for adding the ability to transfer knowledge from older workers to newer workers, augmented reality is a great part of that.  We have mentioned before, about a third of our sales of the software in this space include augmented reality. So it all works together. It's increasing the hit rate for our MES software, because we have a broader portfolio and it works together well. So, there is a lot of positives in this respect. And I should mention it's not just for end-users.  It's also for OEMs, because they are looking for increasing the value of what they are providing and as they look for ways to increase their flexibility getting closer to that zero changeover time for packaging that is hard in the industry today.  Then this has a lot of benefit for them, as well. We had a win in the quarter with Harpak, who you heard from us at the Investor Day in November as they are adding that software to the basic logics control and variable speed drives and so on as part of the basic automation of those systems.  And then as a final point, we have seen, probably a higher degree of adoption of this software on top of competitive control platforms than we originally thought would happen. Thanks, Rob. Yes, let me start with a couple of comments and then Patrick may have got some additional color on that. But as I said, Asia was better than expected. Latin America was worse than expected. North America and EMEA were pretty much in line with expectations. In North America, as we mentioned, we were down by 3% and that was largely due to declines in more process-oriented verticals with the exception of oil and gas.  So, we saw chemical, pulp and paper and metals, and then that was offset by the growth we mentioned in automotive, power and semiconductor. EMEA was up and oil and gas was a contributor there along with a recurrent theme of life sciences. Waste water was a good area for us in EMEA and in Asia, we were up with growth in oil and gas, life sciences, auto, tire and mass transit.  And then, LATAM was down a little bit where weakness in auto and mining was partially offset by growth in power, oil and gas and life sciences. So, that was kind of a rundown of what we saw in Q1. In terms of how the backlog feathers into that, obviously, mainly project, but also with some of the higher value services as well, particularly those included with the Connected Services part of IS/CS. Not yet, is the short answer. I mean, it's a positive step and supporting the concept of free and fair trade that we've talked a lot about in the past. So we think it's a good thing. But we haven't seen the results on outperformance yet. Thank you. Well, as you said, everything we do is about productivity and a huge part of that productivity is efficiency. So, you take our power control offering, variable speed drives, which reduce dramatically the amount of energy that's required to run industrial processes, tremendous amount of the world's energy is consumed in factories and simply, not running full across the line when you don't need it saves a ton of energy and our variable speed drives, low-voltage and medium-voltage continue to be a very strong part of our offering.  Specifically, in the new eco industrial segment that we introduced in November, talking about our support of renewable of water and waste water treatment and mass transit, those are all industries that reduce the amount of energy that are required and it was no coincidence that we created that new segment, because we are going to be doing more in that space.  And then finally, safety, that's something we've talked a lot about in the past and in terms of the technology to be able to automate safety, but also the services that we provided, that's an important part of ESG. We think that we are number one in the world when you pull all the discrete and process safety technology together, and that remains a really important area for us. Well we \u2013 we are guiding to about flat currently with the auto - overall automotive segment for the year. I'd say the growth is highest in the specific EV drivetrain portion of the segment as people have bring in that capacity online whether it's the brand owner or it's the tier supplier, and by the way that contributed a lot to our performance.  That was a little better than expectations and if you want it was battery assembly that was a specific bright spot for there. That's offset to some extent by the reality of a weaker star count for fewer vehicles than we saw a couple years ago being bought. Certainly, a lot of the brand owners are reducing their Sedan portfolio.  But there is still a fair bit of project spend there and in the - particularly in the SUV side of things. And the growth that we saw in the quarter was primarily due to project spend, MRO stabilized, but we didn't see any real growth in MRO in the quarter. Yes. Thanks, Noah. Good morning, Steve. Sure, I'll start with the food and beverage. We did see some delays in food. But one of the bright spots and I mentioned it is, we actually saw mid-single-digit growth in packaging OEMs. And it's early but that's sometimes a leading indicator as people are putting packaging in place and we did see that across the regions.  We also heard anecdotally from the packaging OEMs that their backlog is fairly good. And so those are encouraging signs. One area of particular strength for us \u2013 it's small but it is still noteworthy India packaging OEMs and I say it's is noteworthy because India maybe the most competitive market in the world and for us to have a success there is a really younger testament to the functionality and the ability to get to competitive levels there.  I was actually there in visit with some customers including some packaging OEMs in December. And I think there is some great opportunities there and we are going to continue to look at what we can do to grow our presence even faster in the Indian market. But in general, packaging OEMs were up.  We also saw some strength, specifically in beverage. We had a real nice conversion at a beverage OEM that's going to a well-known beverage user and so that was also good in the quarter. The trend that I think we have seen in the past with chemical and we did see that is the single largest contributor in the quarter. That was primarily in North America, we actually saw an increase in chemical in EMEA, down in Asia, and slightly down in Latin America. So, is it's offset?  As we mentioned, we actually saw a growth in oil and gas, but the chemical was down in the quarter and most of that was concentrated in North America. I would also mention, just for background that, in chemical lot of our exposure in specialty chemical. It's not as much in the bulk chemical. That's our traditional focus. There is some overcapacity that we are currently seeing in chemical and some effects from some of the consolidation that's been going on in the industry over the last couple of years as well. So that's some additional color that would certainly apply to North America. Yes, and that's specific application that Patrick is mentioning in Korea was the battery assembly, which is a great application for us. We have mentioned before that, in comparison to the subtractive manufacturing processes for internal combustion engines, now for boring cylinders and things like that that require a lot of CNC content. Battery assembly and motor winding and EV drivetrain, we have a high readiness to serve there and that's why we think that long-term EV is a great market for us to be in. Yes. Thank you. Hey, Josh. Yes, I wouldn't draw that the causality between the two. But as we talked about a lot in November, that greater resiliency to economic cycles is something that we are making very explicit steps to address. And so, in addition to things like Information Solutions and Connected Services providing a lot of increased value to customers and pulling through some of our traditional products.  It does have an impact that we think is already being felt in terms of kind of clipping the trough of some of the normal volatility. Now it's still a relatively small part of our business, right? But that's compounding a strong double-digit growth, plus what we do with acquisitions having more recurring revenue makes it more important each year and last year.  We think \u2013 for instance, Information Solutions and Connected Services having about a point of organic growth to what we did and you know in a relatively low growth year overall, that's meaningful.  So, we are going to continue to work on that in terms of both our organic development, the products and the environment to be able to manage recurring revenue. But it's also a consideration as we look for companies to acquire and the percentage of recurring revenue. Yes, so, as you said, the macro can generally be characterized as weak and there was some downward revisions. And our position to that is some of the backlog that was built in the first quarter and some of the things.  Again like the IS and CS, the Information Solutions and Connected Services backdrop aren't going to be as coupled directly to some of the broader indicators, if in those areas, we can demonstrate a relatively quick return on that investment, which is often from OpEx then we think that that's going to be more resilient than some of the other more capital-related spending. Yes, I made a general comment to that and that is, manufacturing - advanced manufacturing is becoming a much more noteworthy part of a company's overall digital transformation plans. So we see companies like Stanley Black & Decker, as they talk about fairly significant reductions in cost they're being asked to go a little deeper and explain how they are going to get there and we are finding ourselves apart of those explanations as to how we are going to be able to reduce OpEx for these companies.  By having the relationship with PTC and having that increasingly important in IS/CS offering, we are going to have those broad discussions at a higher level than if we were just talking about programmable controller performance or some of the other elements of basic automation.  So it allows us to get higher in the organization and deploy a meaningful part of those overall discussions whereas if we didn't have that kind of breadth, then we might find ourselves playing a little more deep ends in some of the core components.  So that's at a high level how a partnership with a company like PTC will pull through some performance in the core products, because they all go together, that basic automation and then the information that sits on top of it to draw insights from the data that's born in our products. Thanks, Nigel. Yes, I mean, we are pushing the team, obviously to perform as if they are in an open field because we think they are. We think that what they are offering is somewhat unique in the market and our original hypothesis that there was a low level of basic automation in the oilfield, particularly the onshore oilfield is proving to be true.  So that things that we are talking about as we are selling the traditional offerings into that space of things like measurement, devices, as well as artificial lift and so on, the ability to commence and to weave that together is really meeting with a lot of interest and some of these are our existing customers, but customers that in the past have bought the products as needed from us.  But now they are saying that we can play a much more significant part in their overall strategy. And I had a chance to talk with some of these customers over the last year in Latin America and in Europe and we are excited and even more excited after the first quarter's results, because these companies are voting with their wallets.  And again, it's a solutions-based approach. It's the measurement devices, it's the artificial lifts, it's the software and then it's the delivery capability to bring this all together to reduce their cost to produce a barrel of oil. Yes, so, mechanically, we still have some tough comps against that big Codelco project in mining that we've talked about over the last year or so. And that project is going very well by the way. In general, in Latin America, we saw modest growth in Mexico and Brazil, but it was offset by weakness in Argentina and Chile and of course a good component of that would be mining-related.  Mexico was up low-single-digits and Brazil was also up low-single-digits. So, I think you are right that some of it is comps. We expect mining to be about flat for the year in Latin America. Yes. Thanks, Jessica. As we have been discussing, I am happy to see our new offerings delivering significantly increased value. We've never been better positioned with a more differentiated offering as the convergence of IT and OT creates tremendous new opportunities. And our employees and partners they continue to set us apart and we are really excited about the journey ahead."

            "content": "Thank you, Blake, and good morning everyone.  I'll start on slide 7, First Quarter Key Financial Information. First quarter reported sales were up 2.6% year over year. As expected, organic sales were down 1%. Acquisitions, which mainly represent the impact of Sensia, contributed 4.5 points of growth, better than expected. Currency translation decreased sales by 0.9 points, a higher headwind than we expected. Segment operating margin was 20.1%, down 270 basis points compared to last year. About half of the year-over-year decrease relates to the impact of acquisitions and related one-time costs, primarily Sensia. The other half of the year-over-year margin decrease is about evenly split between higher investment spending and unfavorable mix.  General Corporate \u2013 net expense of $32.8 million was up $11 million compared to last year. The increase is due to the impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our deferred and non-qualified compensation plans and Sensia-related transaction fees.  The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 7.9% compared to 18.7% last year. About half of the reduction in the year-over-year tax rate is due to a Sensia $19 million one-time tax benefit. The remainder is other discrete items, primarily tax benefits from option exercises.  Adjusted EPS of $2.11 was a bit better than we expected, and down $0.10 compared to the first quarter of last year, a decrease of 5%. The year-over-year decrease in Adjusted EPS is primarily due to lower organic sales, particularly in some of our product businesses leading to unfavorable mix, and higher investment spending.  Partially offsetting that is a lower tax rate excluding the Sensia impacts, and the net benefit of a lower share count and higher net interest expense. The net year-over-year adjusted EPS contribution of Sensia in the quarter was one penny.  The Sensia contribution of one penny includes a $0.07 larger-than-expected headwind related to one-time items. Free Cash Flow was $194 million in the quarter, or about 80% of Adjusted Income. During the quarter, we paid the annual bonus that our employees earned in fiscal 2019.  A few additional items not shown on the slide: for Adjusted EPS, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 116.6 million, down 4.9 million or about 4% from last year. We repurchased about 0.5 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $100 million. This is in line with our full year target of about $400 million. At December 31st, we had $1 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization  Slide 8 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our operating segments. The Architecture & Software segment had modest organic growth in the quarter. Segment margin was very strong at 29.8% and a bit lower than the record margin last year, mainly due to increased investment spending.  Organic sales of the Control Products & Solutions segment decreased 2.5%. Inorganic investments increased sales by 8.2% compared to last year. Sensia accounts for almost all of the inorganic growth. Organic sales for our solutions and services businesses in this segment was down about half a point year-over-year. The higher margin product businesses in this segment were down about 5% on an organic basis. First quarter organic book to bill performance for our solutions and services businesses was 1.12, typical for a first quarter. Operating margin for this segment of 12.4% was down 310 basis points compared to Q1 last year, primarily due to Sensia one-time items, lower organic sales, and unfavorable mix. Segment margin excluding the year over year impact of Sensia was about 14%.  In the appendix, you will find two slides with a more detailed overview of the year-over-year incremental impact of Sensia for Q1 and for full year fiscal 2020 outlook. It is the same format we provided to you at our investor day.  As I mentioned earlier, from an operational viewpoint, Sensia sales and earnings were a bit better than we expected. Non-recurring items, including the tax benefit, were $0.07 worse than we expected in the first quarter, primarily due to larger purchase accounting adjustments and a lower tax benefit. For full year fiscal 2020, we now expect the net year-over-year impact of Sensia to be about neutral to adjusted EPS. The financial framework we shared with you at investor day last November remains valid with Sensia. We continue to target 30 to 35% earnings conversion for Rockwell assuming mid-single-digit organic sales growth.  This takes us to slide 9, guidance. Our outlook for fiscal 2020 remains unchanged compared to our November guidance. We are maintaining our sales growth and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. For adjusted EPS, in essence, compared to prior guidance, small headwinds due to Sensia one-time items, currency, and a higher share count are offset by a somewhat lower adjusted effective tax rate. The lower tax rate is the result of a higher excess income tax benefit related to share-based compensation. General corporate net is now expected to be closer to $105 million. Purchase accounting amortization expense for the full year is expected to be about $40 million, up $20 million compared to last year. Net interest expense for fiscal 2020 is still expected to be about $100 million. We expect non-controlling-Interest to be about $10 million, or a $0.10 charge to Adjusted EPS. Average diluted share count is now expected to be 116.5 million for fiscal 2020, and our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be closer to 15.5%, which includes about a 150 basis point one-time benefit related to Sensia. We continue to project free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. Finally, we continue to project a weaker first half of the year, with organic sales down low single digits, followed by a stronger second half of the year. And as is typical for us, we expect weaker 2nd quarter Adjusted EPS performance versus the first quarter.  With that, I'll hand it to Jessica to start Q&A. Yes, what you can think about it, Karen, what you see in the appendix is the year-over-year incremental piece of Sensia. It's the impact of the contribution of Schlumberger, which was higher margin business than what we contributed. And so, therefore, when we talk about overall margin profile of Sensia, we do expect that the 20% EBITDA business going forward. But this year, we think it will be closer to mid-teens. But the piece that was contributed by Schlumberger and the synergy, the answer to that is, yes. I would also say that our spend increased in Sensia, because we are making some investments in technology and commercial resources. They were a little bit lighter in the first quarter than we expected. That's why you see that margin in Q1 being a little bit better, as well than what you see for the full year outlook. Yes, the way you can think about it, Karen is, consistent with what I mentioned to you in November. We think the year-over-year increase will be a little bit less than a 2% and it will be first half weighted. And so, we expect it to be more than that in the first half and in the second half, the increase year-over-year will be minimum in terms of year-over-year spend. Thank you, Karen. Thanks, Rob. Rick, maybe a little bit of color as to our assumptions by region for the full year. So, organic growth at the midpoint is flat year-over-year. We expect both the \u2013 both North America and EMEA to be a little bit below that and we expect both Latin America and Asia to be up a little less than 5%, about mid-single-digits. So, what - but that inflected as we expect in essence better than our guidance, we expect second half of the year as I mentioned improvement and that includes the U.S., I would say, North America. Yes, see, for the full year, we remain at 0% organic growth. Obviously, Q1, we did minus 1. I would say, Q2, low, low-single-digits, meaning it's close to what we did in Q1. We don't expect it to get worse than what we did in Q1 and then for the balance of the year, I'd say, Q4 organic growth a little bit better than Q3. What I was providing was at the midpoint, Steve. As we said in the earlier, within Process, oil and gas was up. But generally, process industries were weak in the quarter. Yes, so, China \u2013 auto in China has been down Q3, Q4 of last year and we saw that continue into the first quarter of fiscal 2020. And that includes EVs. And so we are seeing some of the support or the subsidies go away in China and generally, and obviously it's still a little bit lumpy, because it's relatively small,  But EV and auto in general, we are certainly seeing some weakness in China. Interestingly, auto in Asia was up for us quite a bit and the reason there we are making some progress with some of the EV companies outside of China including some companies in Korea for example. Thank you. Good morning, Josh. Yes, Josh. So, what we mentioned was that the spending in the \u2013 the year-over-year increase in the first half will be higher than in the second half. Actually, the second half the way we have it dialed in now is the flattish from a year-over-year spend point of view. However, if, depending on what happens with our outlook for the year, and if we end up doing better what we do at the midpoint.  Clearly, we could decide to release more investments. There is a very long list of attractive investments that we are looking through all the time and we could decide to do more. Thank you. Yes, and then, Nigel, for Q1, we would say that North America and EMEA came in basically in line with our expectations. Asia-Pacific came in better and Latin America came in weaker. And for the full year, compare estimate point, we think that North America and EMEA will be down a bit and we think that Asia-Pacific and Latin America will be up mid-single-digits at a less than 5%. Good morning, Andy. Thank you, Andy."

[Operator Instructions] \n At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Jessica Kourakos, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Kourakos, please go ahead. \nJessica Kourakos: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO. \n Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include in our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast on this call will be available at our website for replay for the next 30 days. \n For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call. Additional information and news about our company can also be found on Rockwell's Investor Relations Twitter feed using the handle at InvestorsROK, that's @InvestorsROK.\n Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in our SEC filings.  \n So with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake. \nBlake Moret: Thanks, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our quarterly results on Slide 3.  \n We saw another quarter of exceptional demand across all 3 business segments. Total orders surpassed $2.2 billion and grew 40% over the prior year, reflecting a very strong demand pipeline across our portfolio of core automation and digital transformation solutions. Total revenue of over $1.8 billion grew 15%, with additional sales that shifted into fiscal '22 due to supply chain headwinds.  \n Organic sales grew 13% versus prior year. We had very strong growth in core automation and Information Solutions and Connected Services grew double digits in both orders and revenue. This performance was led by strong demand for software and cybersecurity services.  \n Turning to ARR. We continue to make significant progress to drive recurring revenue. Our ARR grew organically by over 18%. And including our recent acquisition of Plex, now accounts for over 8% of total sales. Segment margin of 18% came in line with our expectations with the execution of planned investments in Q4.  \n I'll now comment on our top line performance by business segment. Intelligent Devices organic sales increased 15% versus prior year, even with significant headwinds from supply chain. From the orders perspective, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of record order intake in this segment with orders 30% above fiscal 2019 levels. We continue to see significant strength across the automation portfolio and share gains, particularly evident in motion, led by our independent cart technology. \n Software & Control organic sales grew 14%, led by strong demand across the segment, including double-digit growth in Logix. Orders grew approximately 50% year-over-year, once again showing great momentum across the software control, visualization and network portfolios.  \n In Lifecycle Services, organic sales increased 7% versus the prior year and increased 2% sequentially even with some projects delayed as a result of component availability. Lifecycle Services book-to-bill of 1.09 was well above seasonal Q4 levels. Total company backlog of $2.9 billion grew by over 80% year-over-year. Over 40% of backlog is related to our Lifecycle Services business. \n Turning to Information Solutions and Connected Services, which represent many of Rockwell's newest digital revenue streams. We had another great quarter. Recent orders included a number of meaningful software and infrastructure as a service wins. One of the more notable wins in the quarter was with Ardagh Group, one of the world's largest sustainable packaging companies. The company had placed a $1 million order for fixed software in Q3 to reduce unplanned downtime. Ardagh, like a lot of manufacturers, is trying to respond to a sharp increase in demand. By Q4, as the relationship developed, we pulled through an additional $4 million purchase of core automation products showcasing the tremendous synergy resulting from our new software capabilities and intelligent devices. With their ARR growing 45% and over 470 new fixed customers added in just the last 9 months, I'm very happy with the contributions Fiix has been able to make to our overall business. \n We also had a great win with one of the world's largest food and beverage companies in 2 key application areas. The first win is in the area of predictive analytics, where our Kalypso Digital Consulting business will combine our FactoryTalk innovation suite with our automation technology to provide real-time monitoring and analytics for their manufacturing environment.  \n The second application is in the area of sustainability, where our software and automation technology will be used to help monitor water, air, gas, electricity and steam usage to develop real-time KPIs that further reduce their carbon footprint and drive quantifiable production outcomes. \n Kalypso continues to play a very important role within Rockwell and is spearheading some of the most exciting digital transformation projects in all of manufacturing. Our customers are recognizing Rockwell's expanding capabilities to converge IT and OT and be a strong partner throughout the digital transformation journey. In fact, we announced yesterday that we are adding to Kalypso's capabilities with our acquisition of AVATA, which will strengthen and expand their supply chain solutions domain expertise.  \n This expertise, combined with our operations management software, and that of our partners, drives great outcomes for our customers. We are very excited to be expanding our presence in the connected supply chain since it is such a critical high-growth area.  \n We also accelerated our FactoryTalk SaaS offering with the acquisition of Plex in September. The integration is going well, and we look forward to showcasing the entire FactoryTalk software offering, including Plex at our upcoming Investor Day on November 10 in Houston. We hope to see you there.  \n I'd also like to highlight the increasing traction we are seeing with our PTC partnership. Our sales force is seeing the number and size of engagements growing. The capabilities and versatility of the combined solution is a great way to win, with both existing customers and new ones all over the world. A number of the wins we saw this quarter were in diverse industries around the world. We're happy with this partnership and think it's a great part of our software portfolio.  \n Let's now turn to Slide 4, where I'll provide a few highlights of our Q4 end market performance. We had great performance in our Discrete Industry segment with roughly 15% sales growth. Within this industry segment, automotive sales grew about 15%, led by an increase in EV capital project activity, including a strategic win at Magna, one of the top Tier 1 auto manufacturers delivering EV content for GM and Ford. Semiconductor was strong, growing 20% off of a very good quarter last year. E-commerce performance was also exceptional with sales growing approximately 30% versus a strong prior year.  \n Turning now to our Hybrid Industry segment. The verticals in this segment also had a terrific quarter. Food and beverage grew about 15%, led by strong greenfield and brownfield project opportunities in North America and EMEA as well as strong double-digit OEM demand. \n Life sciences grew over 15% in Q4, and remains one of our top growth verticals. We see continued growth in the overall life sciences market and evidence that we are taking market share. Once again, our fastest-growing vertical in the Hybrid segment was tire, which was up about 35% in the quarter. Process markets grew over 10%, with strong sequential and year-over-year growth in oil and gas, especially in our Sensia JV.  \n In summary, we are clearly seeing very strong growth across Discrete and Hybrid segments as well as improving oil and gas trends.  \n Turning now to Slide 5 and our Q4 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales grew by 16% versus the prior year with strong double-digit growth across all 3 industry segments. EMEA sales increased 7%, driven by strength in food and beverage, tire and metals. \n Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 12%, with broad-based growth led by EV, semiconductor and mining. In China, we saw double-digit growth, driven by strength in mining, life sciences, tire and EV.  \n Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review highlights of fiscal '21. Record orders of $8.2 billion grew 26%. Reported sales grew 11%, even with supply chain constraints. Organic sales grew almost 7%. IS/CS revenue exceeded $500 million at year-end and grew double digits organically. Adjusted EPS grew 20%, and we, once again, generated significant cash flow due to our very profitable financial framework, strong focus on productivity and financial discipline.  \n At the same time, we made significant investments in our future to accelerate profitable growth. That included organic investments as well as inorganic investments. In fiscal '21, we accelerated funding of software development projects and deployed approximately $2.5 billion towards inorganic investments. At the same time, we returned to $800 million back to shareowners in the form of dividends and buybacks.  \n Turning to Slide 7. You can see how these investments and our strong order momentum and backlog are helping to accelerate our top line performance heading into fiscal '22. Our new fiscal '22 outlook expects total reported sales growth of 17.5%, including 15.5% organic growth versus the prior year. These projections take into account our latest view of supply chain constraints. We have the people, supplier commitments and plant capacity to support this growth, but we will no doubt need to continue to manage new challenges as they emerge in this highly dynamic environment.  \n We expect double-digit growth in both core automation as well as Information Solutions and Connected Services. Acquisitions are expected to contribute 2 points of profitable growth. We are increasing our margin expectations to 21.5%, up 150 basis points over the prior year. Our new adjusted EPS target of $10.80, at the midpoint of the range, represents about 15% growth compared to the prior year.  \n I should add that we expect another year of double-digit annual recurring revenue growth, including our recent Plex acquisition, which adds approximately $170 million to our ARR totals in fiscal '22.  \n A more detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 8. I will go into the details on this slide, but as you can see, we continue to expect broad-based organic sales growth in fiscal '22.  \n With that, let me now turn it over to Nick, who will elaborate on our fiscal '21 results and financial outlook for fiscal '22. Nick? \nNicholas Gangestad: Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 9, fourth quarter key financial information. Fourth quarter reported sales were up 15% over last year. Q4 organic sales were up 12.6%, and acquisitions contributed 1 point to total growth. Currency translation increased sales by 1.5 percentage points.  \n Segment operating margin was 17.9%, in line with our expectations. The 230 basis point decline was primarily related to higher plant investment spend, the reversal of temporary pay actions and the restoration of incentive compensation partially offset by the impact of higher sales.\n Corporate & Other expense was $33 million. The year-over-year increase was from deal costs associated with the Plex acquisition. Adjusted EPS of $2.33 was better than expected and grew 21% versus the prior year. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide.  \n The adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was negative 3%, much lower than expected, compared to 15% in the prior year. The lower-than-expected rate was related to the cumulative impact of several onetime discrete items recognized in the current quarter.  \n Free cash flow performance was in line with our expectations. We generated $160 million of free cash flow in the quarter. The free cash flow generation includes higher levels of working capital in the current year to support our increasing revenue and build inventory in anticipation of the accelerated revenue levels in fiscal year '22.  \n One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased 200,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $61 million. For the full year, our share repurchases totaled $301 million, in line with our July guidance. On September 30, $552 million remained available under our repurchase authorization.  \n Slide 10 provides the sales and margin performance of our 3 operating segments. Organic sales of both Intelligent Devices and Software & Control were up double digits. Lifecycle Services organic sales were up sequentially and up 7% year-over-year, led by oil and gas, life sciences and food and beverage. All segments saw strong double-digit growth in orders.  \n Compared to last year, Intelligent Devices margins were up 100 basis points on higher sales. This segment did see higher input costs both year-over-year and sequentially. However, these costs were largely offset by price. Segment margins for the Software & Control segment declined 330 basis points compared to last year, with higher planned investment spend, partially offset by higher organic sales. This segment benefited from positive price cost in the quarter.  \n Lifecycle Services segment margin was 8.1% and declined 820 basis points driven by the reversal of temporary pay actions, the reinstatement of incentive compensation as well as unfavorable mix, partially offset by higher sales.  \n The next slide, 11, provides the adjusted EPS Walk from Q4 fiscal '20 to Q4 fiscal '21. As you can see, core performance was up about $0.70 on a 12.6% organic sales increase. Approximately $0.10 was related to nonrecurring accelerated investments that we announced earlier this year. These investments are mostly in our Software & Control segment.  \n The reversal of temporary pay actions and restoration of incentive compensation contributed negative $0.45. Acquisitions were a $0.15 headwind due to the deal costs associated with the Plex acquisition. As previously noted, our lower adjusted effective tax rate contributed $0.40. \n Slide 12 provides a walk from our Q4 midpoint in our July guidance to our actual Q4 adjusted EPS results. We usually don't provide this information, but I wanted to show how the quarter played out relative to the midpoint of what we had guided back in July.  \n The unforeseen impact of the Delta variants in Southeast Asia added incremental pressure to the supply chain, but the impact of the volume miss of $0.40 was mitigated to lower incentive compensation, further productivity and a favorable mix, all of which contributed $0.35. As previously noted, a more favorable tax rate benefited our EPS versus guidance by $0.25.  \n Moving to Slide 13, product order trends. This slide shows our average daily order trends for our products, which includes our software portfolio. As a reminder, the trends shown here account for about 2/3 of our overall sales. Order intake was broad-based and improved sequentially for the fifth consecutive quarter. Q4 product order levels grew at about 40% versus the prior year and are well above pre-pandemic levels as customers are increasingly interested in investing in our core automation and software, both of which are essential to drive the outcomes that come from digital transformation.  \n Slide 14 provides key financial information for the full year fiscal '21. Reported sales grew 10.5%, including over 1 point coming from acquisitions. Organic sales were up 6.7%, led by double-digit growth in our Hybrid and Discrete end markets and improving process verticals. Full year segment margins remained at about 20%, including close to $30 million of onetime accelerated investments, mostly in our Software & Control segment. R&D expense was up 14% compared to fiscal '20, and R&D as a percent of sales increased further to 6% of sales in fiscal '21.  \n Our core automation, which excludes the impact -- excuse me, our core conversion, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, currency and our accelerated onetime investments, was 34%. Corporate & Other was up just over $20 million, mostly related to acquisition costs associated with the Plex acquisition. Adjusted EPS was up 20%. A detailed year-over-year adjusted EPS Walk can be found in the appendix for your reference.  \n Free cash flow performance remained strong and was in line with our July expectations. Free cash flow conversion was 103% of adjusted income. Finally, ROIC remained well above our target of over 20%. \n For the year, we deployed about $3.3 billion of capital towards acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases in fiscal '21. Our capital structure and liquidity remains strong.  \n Let's move on to the next slide, 15, guidance for fiscal '22. As Blake mentioned, we are expecting sales of about $8.2 billion in fiscal '22, up 17.5% at the midpoint of the range. We expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 14% to 17% and about 15.5% at the midpoint of our range. This outlook includes our latest assumptions on supply chain constraints.  \n We expect full year segment operating margins to be about 21.5%. We expect positive price/cost for the full year from the additional price increase we implemented this month. At the midpoint of our guidance, assumes full year core earnings conversion of between 30% and 35%. We believe we are in the early stages of a cycle of sustained growth and are making investments to fuel this growth in '22 and beyond. Our fiscal '22 segment margin and core conversion outlook includes our plan to increase R&D and other growth-related investments by double digits.  \n We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. We do not anticipate any material discrete items to impact tax in fiscal '22. This rate is under current tax law. Should tax laws change, we would provide an updated outlook with the impacts from these changes.  \n Our adjusted EPS guidance is $10.50 to $11.10. This compares to fiscal '21 adjusted EPS of $9.43. At the midpoint of the range, this represents 15% adjusted EPS growth. I will cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS Walk on the next page.  \n From a calendarization viewpoint, based on our current supply chain availability, we expect our first quarter sales to be relatively flat compared to our Q4 of fiscal '21. Following the first quarter, we expect sequential sales to improve over the balance of the year. We expect segment margins and the adjusted EPS to decline sequentially in Q1 and then improve throughout the year in line with our sales volume and the timing of price increases. We anticipate recent price increases to having more substantial benefit in subsequent quarters given the timing of when customer agreements are renewed throughout the year.  \n Also as a reminder, fiscal '21 Q1 included a nonrecurring $0.45 gain related to the settlement of a legal matter. Finally, we expect full year fiscal '22 free cash flow conversion of about 90% of adjusted income. This reflects a $155 million bonus payout for the fiscal '21 performance, $165 million of capital expenditures and funding higher levels of working capital to support higher sales. Our working capital is targeted to be aligned with our historic amount of about 12% of sales.  \n A few comments -- additional comments on fiscal '22 guidance. Corporate & Other expense is expected to be around $125 million. Net interest expense for fiscal '22 is expected to be about $115 million. And finally, we're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 117.5 million shares.  \n The next slide, 16, provides the adjusted EPS Walk from fiscal '21 to fiscal '22 guidance at the midpoint. Moving from left to right, core performance is expected to contribute $2.15. This includes the benefit of higher organic sales. We anticipate price realization will exceed input cost inflation by about $0.10. Our pricing philosophy is built on the high value that we bring our customers. In light of increasing input costs, we have taken several price adjustments this year to mitigate, and we are prepared to take additional price actions as needed.  \n The removal of the onetime accelerated investments made in fiscal year '21 will be about a $0.20 benefit. The onetime gain from a legal matter that was settled in the prior year is a $0.45 headwind. Plex will be a $0.15 tailwind in fiscal '22, including the impact of incremental interest. We have included further information showing the impact of Plex in both fiscal '21 and fiscal '22 in our appendix. No real significant changes to what we showed in July. We expect about a $0.05 impact coming from share dilution, and the higher tax rate is expected to be about a $0.75 headwind.  \n Moving on to the next slide, 17, I'll make a few comments on our capital deployment framework. Our long-term capital deployment priorities remain the same. Our first priority is organic growth. After that, we focus capital deployment on inorganic activities. And then we focus on capital returns to shareholders, through our dividends and then share repurchases.  \n In addition to our organic and inorganic investments, our capital deployment plans for fiscal '22 include a focus on delevering, dividends of about $520 million and share repurchases of $100 million.  \n In summary, our guidance assumes a combination of order and backlog growth that drives 15.5% organic sales at the midpoint and reaches the total sales of over $8 billion. We continue to offset inflationary pressures through additional price actions yielding segment margins of 21.5%. We expect adjusted EPS growth of 15% and continued strong free cash flow.  \n With that, I'll turn it over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start the Q&A. \nBlake Moret: Thanks, Nick. As we look forward to fiscal '22, strong order trends and record backlog underpin a robust top line outlook. We are making investments in our capacity, technology and people to support our future growth. Our people delivered great results this year, and I want to take a moment to recognize their tremendous work during especially challenging times.  \n As the world recovers, investments in automation and digital transformation have never been more top of mind. Nobody is better positioned to help industrial customers be more resilient, agile and sustainable. As many of you will see at our upcoming Investor Day, we're taking manufacturing to a whole new level and look forward to a great year ahead.  \n Let me now pass the baton back to Jessica to begin the Q&A session. \nJessica Kourakos: Thanks, Blake. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Chris, let's take our first question. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Scott Davis with Melius Research. \nScott Davis: What are your customers saying? Like when you think about kind of the issue here with not just labor, materials and kind of cadencing projects, I mean it seems like every day we see some sort of multibillion-dollar announcement. But there's also that reality that there's just so many integrators and other folks who can get this stuff done. So I know your guide for fiscal 1Q is relatively conservative, but you have things snapping back right after that. What are your customers saying, at least, about their ability or what they think their ability to, at least, get projects done on time today looks like? \nBlake Moret: Well, sometimes it's useful to look at our own plans as a manufacturer in our own right. And our investments, I think, are broadly indicative of what a lot of customers in different industries are doing. They're looking to make sure that they have the capacity to meet the current demand but also looking to get in place the capacity punch new lines of business and find new ways to win, and that's language that we've used, but we're hearing that from a lot of our customers as well.  \n So in some cases, it's just meeting the capacity demands. When we look at semiconductor, and when we look at life sciences in some of these areas, it's to meet current capacity in well-known areas. In other cases, people are looking to launch new lines of business with EV probably being the best known of that. They're very eager to take delivery of our products. And one of the things that we have is the intimacy through our own salespeople as well as through our distribution of line of sight to these projects that are driving the demand and when they're needed. So we're not just guessing when they might need these products, we know what projects they're going into and when those projects are expected to start.  \n To be sure, there's certainly some delays in those projects that our customers are seeing, but they're trying to get these -- this capacity up and running just as soon as possible. \nScott Davis: Yes. That makes a lot of sense. And how do you think about -- I mean are you -- I assume your pricing -- your -- you have tremendous pricing power right now? I mean there has to be somewhat a shortage in the industry overall. Is that -- you talked just about price and then I'll pass it on. \nBlake Moret: Yes. I'll make a couple of comments, and then Nick can add to that as well. I mean we're looking at expanding margins in the coming year taking share in some important industries and product areas and building the foundation for the future, and we're doing it with select pricing increases.  \n I think one of the things that bears mentioning is the tools that we've implemented for pricing have dramatically improved over the last couple of years. So pricing can be a real science with a lot of analytics. And I think we've significantly upgraded the tools and the talent so that we can get price where the market bears that, but also where we can reserve the right to be selectively aggressive to win share. Nick? \nNicholas Gangestad: Yes, I'll just add a couple of things, Scott. Our pricing philosophy is built on this high value we are bringing to our customers. And what we're seeing with increasing input costs, we have taken several price adjustments in fiscal year '21. And we're prepared to take additional price actions as needed if input costs increased more than what we're anticipating at this point. So we do command premium prices in the market. It's reflected in our margins. And we continue to focus on the value we are creating for our customers and the relationships we have there. \nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. \nAndrew Obin: You highlighted ARR of plus 18% in the quarter. Can you just talk about what are the key drivers? And how should we think about this strong exit rate into '22? \nBlake Moret: Yes. So very happy with the development of our ARR, both in terms of the percentage growth and then the step change that we received from acquisitions like Plex. And -- so we're currently looking at an ARR of over 8% of the company's total, and we're continuing on that path.  \n If you think about the main elements of ARR in the company, it starts with software, software subscriptions, software delivered as a service and the associated technical support which is also delivered as a contract either bundled with the software or as a separate subscription or software that's still being sold as a perpetual license. \n But we also have some interesting additional areas, cybersecurity infrastructure as a service. So our industrial data center that comes its hardware with the software and the services bundle to be able to monitor network traffic on-premise has been a great offering that we've had. It's a good business in its own right, and it also pulls through a lot of additional opportunities because it's a different set of decision makers.  \n So those are really the primary areas, and we continue to look to expand with the opening of our new software this year to be able to offer additional services that are bought as a subscription as we develop and release organically developed software that's sold as a service that's running in the cloud. I'm very happy with the robust outlook for growth of existing offerings plus new product introductions, a number of which you'll see next week at Automation Fair. \nAndrew Obin: So I guess, we'll wait until the Analyst Day to hear more about that. But can you just highlight oil and gas improvement? Can you just give more detail by end market, especially North America? I'm looking at sort of upstream, midstream, brownfield, greenfield, just a little bit more color there? \nBlake Moret: Yes. So we did -- we were encouraged by the development of oil and gas in the fourth quarter and the outlook for fiscal '22. Our oil and gas is about 60% -- it's about 60% in upstream, with most of the remainder in midstream. So we're not really doing a whole lot in the downstream side. We do provide power control products and MAVERICK is doing work downstream often with our safety offering. But the majority of our business is in the upstream, and we were happy to see both sequential and year-over-year growth. In the fourth quarter, we saw particularly strong orders from Sensia and the growth was contributed to by all of the regions. \nOperator: Our next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. \nJeffrey Sprague: I'm sorry. You got me there now. Just a couple of questions. Just first on price, I don't know if you said it, but could you be specific on the amount of price you actually achieved in 2021? And what's embedded in 2022? We see the positive price/cost spread, obviously, of $0.10, but I'm curious on the actual nominal price capture involved here? \nNicholas Gangestad: Yes, Jeff, we had a little over 1% price growth in fiscal year '21, and we're projecting an approximately 2% net price growth in '22. However, I will be quick to caution that is based on our current level of cost increases. We are prepared to increase that more if we see additional cost increases coming in that we haven't anticipated in our latest price adjustments. \nJeffrey Sprague: And then also, I guess, investment spend would be embedded in the core number. But I think you said, Nick, you're growing at double digit. Are you growing at actually less than sales growth? I wonder if you could just kind of speak to what the actual rate of growth is? Actually, is it a tailwind inside that core number? \nNicholas Gangestad: Yes. Jeff, that is accretive to our margins because it's not growing at the same pace as our sales, but it is in the -- as I said, double digits. It's from the low double digits. And Jeff, just to put some color on it, we see ourselves in the early stages of a cycle of sustained growth. And we are making investments in '22 to fuel that growth both in '22 and then beyond. And so we are increasing our spending in '22 on R&D and other growth-related investments.  \n Some of the places we're investing, Jeff, we're investing in some key products and software development projects, mostly in Software & Control. We're investing in customer-facing selling resources, and the addition of some travel and customer-facing expenses that had gone down during the pandemic. And we're also expanding investments in our plant capacity. So those are some of the big areas, Jeff, where you're seeing investment spend increase in '22. \nJeffrey Sprague: And I'm sorry, if I could just squeeze one more in. Nick, could you just elaborate a little bit more on Q1? I mean actually, it would be normal for Q1 sales to decline sequentially, I think, and you have them flat. So the idea that EPS may decline sequentially does just jump out a little bit. Maybe just elaborate what's going on with price cost or other things to drive to that outcome in the quarter? \nNicholas Gangestad: Yes, Jeff, what we are seeing is our Q1 sequential with Q4, that's really based -- from a revenue standpoint, it's based on what we are anticipating from supply chain constraints and that, that will be keeping our revenue flat as we move from Q4 into Q1.  \n From a margin standpoint and an EPS perspective, some of our price increases that we have implemented will be impacting the later quarters of '22 more than they will be impacting the first quarter of '22. So part of what I'm sharing, as I say, what we expect for margin in the first quarter of '22 is impacted by the timing of price increases -- impacting our revenue and our margins as we go through the year. We also expect that cost increases from a year-on-year perspective will be most pronounced in our first quarter. And then from an EPS perspective, I will just point out first quarter of last year, we had a $0.45 gain from a legal settlement, and that will not be repeating. \nOperator: Our next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. \nJoshua Pokrzywinski: And just first question, I guess, on the backlog. Like you talked about it several times kind of a source of strength in the next year. How much of the growth is really kind of catch up or conversion of maybe this excess or elevated backlog versus maybe commentary on the underlying end markets? \nBlake Moret: So as we talked about backlog of $2.9 billion is at a huge level. And we said about 40% of that is Lifecycle Services, reflecting the strengthening dynamic of our longer cycle project business, which includes a high process content. And then you, of course, have the product backlog that's being built by those enormous order quarters in Intelligent Devices and also in Software & Control.  \n So we have a huge tailwind coming from that, but we see continuing demand. The demand remains strong coming in. And so it really is a mix, but the sharply increased sales in '22 is due to strength and secular tailwinds, let's say, investment themes and a number of the industries that we're serving. And just in general, as people are building in resilience and agility into their basic operations, we think that, that is part of what's being reflected in our orders intake and the subsequent sales growth in '22. And we're making the investments to be a beneficiary of those trends beyond '22 as well. \nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Okay. And then maybe just a coincidence, but everything from like an end market perspective, up 15% is pretty strong, but also strangely level, I guess, on one hand, maybe a good economic indicator, but also says that nothing at the end market basis is sort of standing out. Is there anything that can sort of be added to that? Or anything maybe at the product level that tells a different story? \nBlake Moret: Sure. I think if you go 1 level deeper in some of those end markets, in automotive, obviously, EV investment for capital projects is coming out. And so that's at a high level. You look at life sciences, there's obviously the work there associated with COVID treatments and vaccines. \n We're a little surprised by the uniformity, but I think each one has its own story. Oil and gas, we love it to be part of the pack again, so to speak. So I think if you go through each one, you can see that. And then obviously, there's some regional variation as well. \nOperator: Our next question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. \nJulian Mitchell: Just wanted to follow up on the free cash flow topic. Nick, I know you made some comments around that in the prepared remarks, but the free cash flow, I think, is guided about $1.1 billion. That would imply the same free cash flow dollar number for sort of 5 years in a row now. So I just wondered if there's something maybe in the business mix as you're shifting towards more ARR or more software-focused that's becoming a drag on the cash flow near term as the business model sort of shifts? Or do you just view it as each year, there's some onetime headwinds that are kind of keeping that free cash flow sort of stuck at that number, even as the sales and adjusted profit is growing? \nNicholas Gangestad: Yes. Julian, the biggest story in the 90% free cash flow conversion for us in '22 is really the higher revenues and that's -- and the working capital that we're putting in place to go with those higher revenues. That's the single biggest thing. \n Secondary things that we are seeing, Julian, are the payout of our bonus in '22 related to the '21 performance. And then we're also increasing our CapEx investment in light of the higher demand for our products. But no, in terms of our mix and anything going on from that perspective, that's not really having an impact, Julian. \nJulian Mitchell: Understood. And then just trying to follow up on the topic of sort of backlog and conversion. So I think your backlog is worth about 1/3 of your fiscal '22 revenue guide. And you said it was $2.9 billion, your guide is 8 2. Just wondered sort of as you look at sort of backlog conversion today, is the main assumption that it's slower right now because of supply constraints, that conversion into revenue then accelerates from January, February and also your incoming orders pace continues to grow over the balance of the year. Is that the sort of the way to think about backlog and orders? \nBlake Moret: In a word, yes. That's right. And I should mention the quality of the backlog, we think, is good since it's a higher percent of products than you would normally expect in terms of the traditional split of our backlog because of the longer lead times with some of those products \nOperator: Our next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Just on this topic of investment spend. I think you guys have this like a bucket of like $2 billion that you use on the P&L to talk about investment spend. I think you threw in CapEx in the discussion with maybe Jeff it was. What is that $2 billion going to grow this year? And then what is the number net of the decline in onetime? So if you include the onetime impact, what is the year-over-year growth or absolute headwind, however you want to talk about it, on that $2 billion of investment spend that typically runs through the P&L? \nNicholas Gangestad: So Steve, we had approximately $30 million of onetime spend that we did in fiscal year '21. That's not repeating. Then to our total fiscal year '22 of the roughly $2 billion of investment spend, that's what we're saying is going up double digits in '22, low double digits actually. So there's a little over $200 million of increase there in investment spend. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Parts of the bridge that you want to call out on that on this front, whether it's some of the incentive comp or -- sorry, it was on a call earlier, you may have highlighted it, but anything else in the bridge moving around? \nNicholas Gangestad: We have some onetimes that impacted us in fiscal year '21 that we're pointing out that those will not repeat. Also, the tax rate is based on current tax law. If this tax law does change, we would update what we expect for that. But Steve, those are a couple of the things I'd just point out. \nOperator: Our next question is from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Blake, this is your third quarter in a row with orders of $2 billion or more, and they've continued to go higher without larger projects this quarter. I know we've asked you this before, but do you get any sense that some of the strength has been customers getting in mind or double ordering? And given it still seems early your process automation recovery and the inorganic additions you've made at the company, is it reasonable to think that orders can maintain or even grow from these levels over the next few quarters? \nBlake Moret: Yes. So in Q4, there certainly were some pull-ins in the quarter. But as we talk to our sales force and distribution, we think it's well under 10% of the total. So we think the vast majority of what we're seeing is underlying demand, and it's broad-based across multiple industries.  \n So we do believe, and we're seeing this into October. We continue to see strong demand coming from customers as some of these secular tailwinds that we've talked about, and you pick the industry, are investing, whether it's in transportation or food and beverage, life sciences. Chemical is expected to have decent growth in the coming year for building chemicals and packaging chemicals.  \n So you can see it from a variety of places. And so we're very optimistic about continued order growth in the year, particularly because we're talking to customers about new things, new capabilities that 24, 36 months ago, we didn't have in our portfolio. But there's a pretty significant expansion of what we can talk to customers about in all 3 of our business segments. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: And Blake, I wanted to follow up on some of the comments you made on EV. Obviously, during the quarter, there were several additional announcements of planned CapEx by some of your customers, EV battery facilities. And you mentioned that your EV business led 15% automotive growth, despite big production declines from many of your customers. So can you give us more color into what your for EV-related business in FY '22? We know you're seeing automotive up mid-teens. And how much of that is just auto build recovery versus what could be the opportunity for you in EV? \nBlake Moret: Yes. I think the majority of it is getting our new models on the road. That's how where these traditional brand owners are getting out there with EV and how the start-ups stay in business, getting a return on the investments that have been made in them. For scale, you think about automotive being about 8% of Rockwell's total business with EV about 1/4 of that, so about 25%. And we expect over multiple years EV and associated battery are going to be a strong driver of growth for us.  \n And that's around the world. I mean you look at the wins that we're getting in China associated with battery and EV. And it's clearly a calling card for us. We look at the wins, the opportunities that we have with Plex in the Tier providers. All of these things, I think, are positive for us. \nOperator: Our next question is from Markus Mittermaier with UBS. \nMarkus Mittermaier: I wanted to come back to backlog and pricing, if I could, and link the 2. I wonder sort of how much ability you have in the existing backlog to adjust prices there if need be? \nNicholas Gangestad: Markus, the significant majority of our backlog, we are not repricing. There is a relatively small portion of our backlog that has more dynamic prices that we can adjust. So we are not changing the prices in our product backlog.  \n But as Blake mentioned earlier, when we look at our total backlog and as we work through some of that in '22, it's favorable. It's favorable in terms of the mix that we're seeing there. So we don't expect it to be dilutive. We actually expect it to be accretive to us in '22. \nMarkus Mittermaier: That's helpful. And then, Blake, you've mentioned share gains in motion. I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit on that, which regions, which product categories and what's the ultimate driver there? \nBlake Moret: So I mentioned motion control, and we're seeing share gains from a couple of places. First of all, our traditional products that are controlling the motion of a more traditional motor, we have some very strong products there and they're fit in an overall integrated control and information architecture are doing very well. We had some product releases of organically developed products last year that get to the more price-sensitive markets like China, and we've seen some good uptick in our kinetics products there.  \n But an area that we've talked, especially about in the last few quarters, is independent cart technology. And so it's linear motion control and due to its ability to save space on machinery acceleration and deceleration rates, the integration as part -- a fundamental part of the machinery really gives us a very differentiated offering in a variety of industries around the world. So it can be used in power transmission in vehicles. It can be used in tire building, in packaging, or food and beverage and life sciences. There's even some interesting applications that we're working on in mining.  \n And so it's very versatile set of technology. We bought 2 small companies to get into that to complement actually a technology we've had for many years, and then we'll continue to invest and build it into the overall automation architecture. So we're very happy with the growth that we're seeing there, which continues at strong double digits. \nJessica Kourakos: Operator, we'll take one last question. \nOperator: Certainly. Our final question is from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. \nNoah Kaye: Certainly, the acquisition of AVATA seems very timely with supply chain management challenges that seem ramping across the industries. And like you've often talked about Rockwell's own manufacturing journey being a great test case for customers. Curious, how do you think say, having AVATA and the ability to manage supply chain and the cloud solution? How might that impact or be able to impact you going forward just to gain increased control and visibility of your own supply chain? And how do you see it benefiting the customers? \nBlake Moret: Well, we're excited about using the technology in our own operations. So we've got a pretty good system on the floor and taking that data into information systems today. But one of the real excitement for a big company like Rockwell in a cloud-based solution is the ease of implementation for the same reasons that small- and medium-sized businesses like it because they may not have an IT department to be able to manage a big fleet of computers in their plants.  \n The ability to have a cloud-based approach is exciting when we make new acquisitions. When we open more agile plants around the world, the heavy lift that would come with more traditional systems may not be what's most appropriate.  \n On the other hand, we're going to continue to do well with our on-prem MES offering because you have a lot of companies, particularly those in regulated industries that cannot change quickly. They need to have the ability to maintain a system with no change for many years. And so that on-prem system can be very helpful there. And so we see the 2 coexisting for a long time to come. \nNoah Kaye: That's helpful. And then just curious if you can comment on any potential shifts in customer spending from CapEx to OpEx? You mentioned Sensia seems to be recovering. Wondering, as many of the customer base, particularly on the process side, are being relatively disciplined with CapEx investments, whether this is a significant transition you're seeing? And any potential wallet share gains as a result? \nBlake Moret: Well, we think in Sensia for oil and gas, we think the fundamental value proposition is still as strong as when we entered into it. And we are seeing that reflected in our orders. In mining, as you said, those companies are being disciplined with their capital spend, even with super high commodity prices, we haven't seen a dramatic increase in the release of funds for big capital expenditures.  \n Some of that's going to have to come because they only stay in business by having the ability to efficiently bring the resources to market. And we're talking to them about quotes. There's activity there, but we haven't seen it manifest itself yet. I did mention earlier, chemical is a process vertical. But we do see good growth in the teens over the year, and it's for things like construction resins as well as chemicals used in packaging because people are still getting lots of products and boxes delivered to them. \nOperator: Yes. This concludes the Q&A session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Kourakos for any closing remarks. \nJessica Kourakos: Thanks, Chris. Thanks, everyone, for joining us. We look forward to seeing you next week, hopefully, and have a great day. \nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. At this time, you may now disconnect. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Blake Moret",
            "content": "Thanks, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our quarterly results on Slide 3.  \n We saw another quarter of exceptional demand across all 3 business segments. Total orders surpassed $2.2 billion and grew 40% over the prior year, reflecting a very strong demand pipeline across our portfolio of core automation and digital transformation solutions. Total revenue of over $1.8 billion grew 15%, with additional sales that shifted into fiscal '22 due to supply chain headwinds.  \n Organic sales grew 13% versus prior year. We had very strong growth in core automation and Information Solutions and Connected Services grew double digits in both orders and revenue. This performance was led by strong demand for software and cybersecurity services.  \n Turning to ARR. We continue to make significant progress to drive recurring revenue. Our ARR grew organically by over 18%. And including our recent acquisition of Plex, now accounts for over 8% of total sales. Segment margin of 18% came in line with our expectations with the execution of planned investments in Q4.  \n I'll now comment on our top line performance by business segment. Intelligent Devices organic sales increased 15% versus prior year, even with significant headwinds from supply chain. From the orders perspective, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of record order intake in this segment with orders 30% above fiscal 2019 levels. We continue to see significant strength across the automation portfolio and share gains, particularly evident in motion, led by our independent cart technology. \n Software & Control organic sales grew 14%, led by strong demand across the segment, including double-digit growth in Logix. Orders grew approximately 50% year-over-year, once again showing great momentum across the software control, visualization and network portfolios.  \n In Lifecycle Services, organic sales increased 7% versus the prior year and increased 2% sequentially even with some projects delayed as a result of component availability. Lifecycle Services book-to-bill of 1.09 was well above seasonal Q4 levels. Total company backlog of $2.9 billion grew by over 80% year-over-year. Over 40% of backlog is related to our Lifecycle Services business. \n Turning to Information Solutions and Connected Services, which represent many of Rockwell's newest digital revenue streams. We had another great quarter. Recent orders included a number of meaningful software and infrastructure as a service wins. One of the more notable wins in the quarter was with Ardagh Group, one of the world's largest sustainable packaging companies. The company had placed a $1 million order for fixed software in Q3 to reduce unplanned downtime. Ardagh, like a lot of manufacturers, is trying to respond to a sharp increase in demand. By Q4, as the relationship developed, we pulled through an additional $4 million purchase of core automation products showcasing the tremendous synergy resulting from our new software capabilities and intelligent devices. With their ARR growing 45% and over 470 new fixed customers added in just the last 9 months, I'm very happy with the contributions Fiix has been able to make to our overall business. \n We also had a great win with one of the world's largest food and beverage companies in 2 key application areas. The first win is in the area of predictive analytics, where our Kalypso Digital Consulting business will combine our FactoryTalk innovation suite with our automation technology to provide real-time monitoring and analytics for their manufacturing environment.  \n The second application is in the area of sustainability, where our software and automation technology will be used to help monitor water, air, gas, electricity and steam usage to develop real-time KPIs that further reduce their carbon footprint and drive quantifiable production outcomes. \n Kalypso continues to play a very important role within Rockwell and is spearheading some of the most exciting digital transformation projects in all of manufacturing. Our customers are recognizing Rockwell's expanding capabilities to converge IT and OT and be a strong partner throughout the digital transformation journey. In fact, we announced yesterday that we are adding to Kalypso's capabilities with our acquisition of AVATA, which will strengthen and expand their supply chain solutions domain expertise.  \n This expertise, combined with our operations management software, and that of our partners, drives great outcomes for our customers. We are very excited to be expanding our presence in the connected supply chain since it is such a critical high-growth area.  \n We also accelerated our FactoryTalk SaaS offering with the acquisition of Plex in September. The integration is going well, and we look forward to showcasing the entire FactoryTalk software offering, including Plex at our upcoming Investor Day on November 10 in Houston. We hope to see you there.  \n I'd also like to highlight the increasing traction we are seeing with our PTC partnership. Our sales force is seeing the number and size of engagements growing. The capabilities and versatility of the combined solution is a great way to win, with both existing customers and new ones all over the world. A number of the wins we saw this quarter were in diverse industries around the world. We're happy with this partnership and think it's a great part of our software portfolio.  \n Let's now turn to Slide 4, where I'll provide a few highlights of our Q4 end market performance. We had great performance in our Discrete Industry segment with roughly 15% sales growth. Within this industry segment, automotive sales grew about 15%, led by an increase in EV capital project activity, including a strategic win at Magna, one of the top Tier 1 auto manufacturers delivering EV content for GM and Ford. Semiconductor was strong, growing 20% off of a very good quarter last year. E-commerce performance was also exceptional with sales growing approximately 30% versus a strong prior year.  \n Turning now to our Hybrid Industry segment. The verticals in this segment also had a terrific quarter. Food and beverage grew about 15%, led by strong greenfield and brownfield project opportunities in North America and EMEA as well as strong double-digit OEM demand. \n Life sciences grew over 15% in Q4, and remains one of our top growth verticals. We see continued growth in the overall life sciences market and evidence that we are taking market share. Once again, our fastest-growing vertical in the Hybrid segment was tire, which was up about 35% in the quarter. Process markets grew over 10%, with strong sequential and year-over-year growth in oil and gas, especially in our Sensia JV.  \n In summary, we are clearly seeing very strong growth across Discrete and Hybrid segments as well as improving oil and gas trends.  \n Turning now to Slide 5 and our Q4 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales grew by 16% versus the prior year with strong double-digit growth across all 3 industry segments. EMEA sales increased 7%, driven by strength in food and beverage, tire and metals. \n Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 12%, with broad-based growth led by EV, semiconductor and mining. In China, we saw double-digit growth, driven by strength in mining, life sciences, tire and EV.  \n Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review highlights of fiscal '21. Record orders of $8.2 billion grew 26%. Reported sales grew 11%, even with supply chain constraints. Organic sales grew almost 7%. IS/CS revenue exceeded $500 million at year-end and grew double digits organically. Adjusted EPS grew 20%, and we, once again, generated significant cash flow due to our very profitable financial framework, strong focus on productivity and financial discipline.  \n At the same time, we made significant investments in our future to accelerate profitable growth. That included organic investments as well as inorganic investments. In fiscal '21, we accelerated funding of software development projects and deployed approximately $2.5 billion towards inorganic investments. At the same time, we returned to $800 million back to shareowners in the form of dividends and buybacks.  \n Turning to Slide 7. You can see how these investments and our strong order momentum and backlog are helping to accelerate our top line performance heading into fiscal '22. Our new fiscal '22 outlook expects total reported sales growth of 17.5%, including 15.5% organic growth versus the prior year. These projections take into account our latest view of supply chain constraints. We have the people, supplier commitments and plant capacity to support this growth, but we will no doubt need to continue to manage new challenges as they emerge in this highly dynamic environment.  \n We expect double-digit growth in both core automation as well as Information Solutions and Connected Services. Acquisitions are expected to contribute 2 points of profitable growth. We are increasing our margin expectations to 21.5%, up 150 basis points over the prior year. Our new adjusted EPS target of $10.80, at the midpoint of the range, represents about 15% growth compared to the prior year.  \n I should add that we expect another year of double-digit annual recurring revenue growth, including our recent Plex acquisition, which adds approximately $170 million to our ARR totals in fiscal '22.  \n A more detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 8. I will go into the details on this slide, but as you can see, we continue to expect broad-based organic sales growth in fiscal '22.  \n With that, let me now turn it over to Nick, who will elaborate on our fiscal '21 results and financial outlook for fiscal '22. Nick? Thanks, Nick. As we look forward to fiscal '22, strong order trends and record backlog underpin a robust top line outlook. We are making investments in our capacity, technology and people to support our future growth. Our people delivered great results this year, and I want to take a moment to recognize their tremendous work during especially challenging times.  \n As the world recovers, investments in automation and digital transformation have never been more top of mind. Nobody is better positioned to help industrial customers be more resilient, agile and sustainable. As many of you will see at our upcoming Investor Day, we're taking manufacturing to a whole new level and look forward to a great year ahead.  \n Let me now pass the baton back to Jessica to begin the Q&A session. Well, sometimes it's useful to look at our own plans as a manufacturer in our own right. And our investments, I think, are broadly indicative of what a lot of customers in different industries are doing. They're looking to make sure that they have the capacity to meet the current demand but also looking to get in place the capacity punch new lines of business and find new ways to win, and that's language that we've used, but we're hearing that from a lot of our customers as well.  \n So in some cases, it's just meeting the capacity demands. When we look at semiconductor, and when we look at life sciences in some of these areas, it's to meet current capacity in well-known areas. In other cases, people are looking to launch new lines of business with EV probably being the best known of that. They're very eager to take delivery of our products. And one of the things that we have is the intimacy through our own salespeople as well as through our distribution of line of sight to these projects that are driving the demand and when they're needed. So we're not just guessing when they might need these products, we know what projects they're going into and when those projects are expected to start.  \n To be sure, there's certainly some delays in those projects that our customers are seeing, but they're trying to get these -- this capacity up and running just as soon as possible. Yes. I'll make a couple of comments, and then Nick can add to that as well. I mean we're looking at expanding margins in the coming year taking share in some important industries and product areas and building the foundation for the future, and we're doing it with select pricing increases.  \n I think one of the things that bears mentioning is the tools that we've implemented for pricing have dramatically improved over the last couple of years. So pricing can be a real science with a lot of analytics. And I think we've significantly upgraded the tools and the talent so that we can get price where the market bears that, but also where we can reserve the right to be selectively aggressive to win share. Nick? Yes. So very happy with the development of our ARR, both in terms of the percentage growth and then the step change that we received from acquisitions like Plex. And -- so we're currently looking at an ARR of over 8% of the company's total, and we're continuing on that path.  \n If you think about the main elements of ARR in the company, it starts with software, software subscriptions, software delivered as a service and the associated technical support which is also delivered as a contract either bundled with the software or as a separate subscription or software that's still being sold as a perpetual license. \n But we also have some interesting additional areas, cybersecurity infrastructure as a service. So our industrial data center that comes its hardware with the software and the services bundle to be able to monitor network traffic on-premise has been a great offering that we've had. It's a good business in its own right, and it also pulls through a lot of additional opportunities because it's a different set of decision makers.  \n So those are really the primary areas, and we continue to look to expand with the opening of our new software this year to be able to offer additional services that are bought as a subscription as we develop and release organically developed software that's sold as a service that's running in the cloud. I'm very happy with the robust outlook for growth of existing offerings plus new product introductions, a number of which you'll see next week at Automation Fair. Yes. So we did -- we were encouraged by the development of oil and gas in the fourth quarter and the outlook for fiscal '22. Our oil and gas is about 60% -- it's about 60% in upstream, with most of the remainder in midstream. So we're not really doing a whole lot in the downstream side. We do provide power control products and MAVERICK is doing work downstream often with our safety offering. But the majority of our business is in the upstream, and we were happy to see both sequential and year-over-year growth. In the fourth quarter, we saw particularly strong orders from Sensia and the growth was contributed to by all of the regions. So as we talked about backlog of $2.9 billion is at a huge level. And we said about 40% of that is Lifecycle Services, reflecting the strengthening dynamic of our longer cycle project business, which includes a high process content. And then you, of course, have the product backlog that's being built by those enormous order quarters in Intelligent Devices and also in Software & Control.  \n So we have a huge tailwind coming from that, but we see continuing demand. The demand remains strong coming in. And so it really is a mix, but the sharply increased sales in '22 is due to strength and secular tailwinds, let's say, investment themes and a number of the industries that we're serving. And just in general, as people are building in resilience and agility into their basic operations, we think that, that is part of what's being reflected in our orders intake and the subsequent sales growth in '22. And we're making the investments to be a beneficiary of those trends beyond '22 as well. Sure. I think if you go 1 level deeper in some of those end markets, in automotive, obviously, EV investment for capital projects is coming out. And so that's at a high level. You look at life sciences, there's obviously the work there associated with COVID treatments and vaccines. \n We're a little surprised by the uniformity, but I think each one has its own story. Oil and gas, we love it to be part of the pack again, so to speak. So I think if you go through each one, you can see that. And then obviously, there's some regional variation as well. In a word, yes. That's right. And I should mention the quality of the backlog, we think, is good since it's a higher percent of products than you would normally expect in terms of the traditional split of our backlog because of the longer lead times with some of those products Yes. So in Q4, there certainly were some pull-ins in the quarter. But as we talk to our sales force and distribution, we think it's well under 10% of the total. So we think the vast majority of what we're seeing is underlying demand, and it's broad-based across multiple industries.  \n So we do believe, and we're seeing this into October. We continue to see strong demand coming from customers as some of these secular tailwinds that we've talked about, and you pick the industry, are investing, whether it's in transportation or food and beverage, life sciences. Chemical is expected to have decent growth in the coming year for building chemicals and packaging chemicals.  \n So you can see it from a variety of places. And so we're very optimistic about continued order growth in the year, particularly because we're talking to customers about new things, new capabilities that 24, 36 months ago, we didn't have in our portfolio. But there's a pretty significant expansion of what we can talk to customers about in all 3 of our business segments. Yes. I think the majority of it is getting our new models on the road. That's how where these traditional brand owners are getting out there with EV and how the start-ups stay in business, getting a return on the investments that have been made in them. For scale, you think about automotive being about 8% of Rockwell's total business with EV about 1/4 of that, so about 25%. And we expect over multiple years EV and associated battery are going to be a strong driver of growth for us.  \n And that's around the world. I mean you look at the wins that we're getting in China associated with battery and EV. And it's clearly a calling card for us. We look at the wins, the opportunities that we have with Plex in the Tier providers. All of these things, I think, are positive for us. So I mentioned motion control, and we're seeing share gains from a couple of places. First of all, our traditional products that are controlling the motion of a more traditional motor, we have some very strong products there and they're fit in an overall integrated control and information architecture are doing very well. We had some product releases of organically developed products last year that get to the more price-sensitive markets like China, and we've seen some good uptick in our kinetics products there.  \n But an area that we've talked, especially about in the last few quarters, is independent cart technology. And so it's linear motion control and due to its ability to save space on machinery acceleration and deceleration rates, the integration as part -- a fundamental part of the machinery really gives us a very differentiated offering in a variety of industries around the world. So it can be used in power transmission in vehicles. It can be used in tire building, in packaging, or food and beverage and life sciences. There's even some interesting applications that we're working on in mining.  \n And so it's very versatile set of technology. We bought 2 small companies to get into that to complement actually a technology we've had for many years, and then we'll continue to invest and build it into the overall automation architecture. So we're very happy with the growth that we're seeing there, which continues at strong double digits. Well, we're excited about using the technology in our own operations. So we've got a pretty good system on the floor and taking that data into information systems today. But one of the real excitement for a big company like Rockwell in a cloud-based solution is the ease of implementation for the same reasons that small- and medium-sized businesses like it because they may not have an IT department to be able to manage a big fleet of computers in their plants.  \n The ability to have a cloud-based approach is exciting when we make new acquisitions. When we open more agile plants around the world, the heavy lift that would come with more traditional systems may not be what's most appropriate.  \n On the other hand, we're going to continue to do well with our on-prem MES offering because you have a lot of companies, particularly those in regulated industries that cannot change quickly. They need to have the ability to maintain a system with no change for many years. And so that on-prem system can be very helpful there. And so we see the 2 coexisting for a long time to come. Well, we think in Sensia for oil and gas, we think the fundamental value proposition is still as strong as when we entered into it. And we are seeing that reflected in our orders. In mining, as you said, those companies are being disciplined with their capital spend, even with super high commodity prices, we haven't seen a dramatic increase in the release of funds for big capital expenditures.  \n Some of that's going to have to come because they only stay in business by having the ability to efficiently bring the resources to market. And we're talking to them about quotes. There's activity there, but we haven't seen it manifest itself yet. I did mention earlier, chemical is a process vertical. But we do see good growth in the teens over the year, and it's for things like construction resins as well as chemicals used in packaging because people are still getting lots of products and boxes delivered to them."

            "name": "Nicholas Gangestad",
            "content": "Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 9, fourth quarter key financial information. Fourth quarter reported sales were up 15% over last year. Q4 organic sales were up 12.6%, and acquisitions contributed 1 point to total growth. Currency translation increased sales by 1.5 percentage points.  \n Segment operating margin was 17.9%, in line with our expectations. The 230 basis point decline was primarily related to higher plant investment spend, the reversal of temporary pay actions and the restoration of incentive compensation partially offset by the impact of higher sales.\n Corporate & Other expense was $33 million. The year-over-year increase was from deal costs associated with the Plex acquisition. Adjusted EPS of $2.33 was better than expected and grew 21% versus the prior year. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide.  \n The adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was negative 3%, much lower than expected, compared to 15% in the prior year. The lower-than-expected rate was related to the cumulative impact of several onetime discrete items recognized in the current quarter.  \n Free cash flow performance was in line with our expectations. We generated $160 million of free cash flow in the quarter. The free cash flow generation includes higher levels of working capital in the current year to support our increasing revenue and build inventory in anticipation of the accelerated revenue levels in fiscal year '22.  \n One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased 200,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $61 million. For the full year, our share repurchases totaled $301 million, in line with our July guidance. On September 30, $552 million remained available under our repurchase authorization.  \n Slide 10 provides the sales and margin performance of our 3 operating segments. Organic sales of both Intelligent Devices and Software & Control were up double digits. Lifecycle Services organic sales were up sequentially and up 7% year-over-year, led by oil and gas, life sciences and food and beverage. All segments saw strong double-digit growth in orders.  \n Compared to last year, Intelligent Devices margins were up 100 basis points on higher sales. This segment did see higher input costs both year-over-year and sequentially. However, these costs were largely offset by price. Segment margins for the Software & Control segment declined 330 basis points compared to last year, with higher planned investment spend, partially offset by higher organic sales. This segment benefited from positive price cost in the quarter.  \n Lifecycle Services segment margin was 8.1% and declined 820 basis points driven by the reversal of temporary pay actions, the reinstatement of incentive compensation as well as unfavorable mix, partially offset by higher sales.  \n The next slide, 11, provides the adjusted EPS Walk from Q4 fiscal '20 to Q4 fiscal '21. As you can see, core performance was up about $0.70 on a 12.6% organic sales increase. Approximately $0.10 was related to nonrecurring accelerated investments that we announced earlier this year. These investments are mostly in our Software & Control segment.  \n The reversal of temporary pay actions and restoration of incentive compensation contributed negative $0.45. Acquisitions were a $0.15 headwind due to the deal costs associated with the Plex acquisition. As previously noted, our lower adjusted effective tax rate contributed $0.40. \n Slide 12 provides a walk from our Q4 midpoint in our July guidance to our actual Q4 adjusted EPS results. We usually don't provide this information, but I wanted to show how the quarter played out relative to the midpoint of what we had guided back in July.  \n The unforeseen impact of the Delta variants in Southeast Asia added incremental pressure to the supply chain, but the impact of the volume miss of $0.40 was mitigated to lower incentive compensation, further productivity and a favorable mix, all of which contributed $0.35. As previously noted, a more favorable tax rate benefited our EPS versus guidance by $0.25.  \n Moving to Slide 13, product order trends. This slide shows our average daily order trends for our products, which includes our software portfolio. As a reminder, the trends shown here account for about 2/3 of our overall sales. Order intake was broad-based and improved sequentially for the fifth consecutive quarter. Q4 product order levels grew at about 40% versus the prior year and are well above pre-pandemic levels as customers are increasingly interested in investing in our core automation and software, both of which are essential to drive the outcomes that come from digital transformation.  \n Slide 14 provides key financial information for the full year fiscal '21. Reported sales grew 10.5%, including over 1 point coming from acquisitions. Organic sales were up 6.7%, led by double-digit growth in our Hybrid and Discrete end markets and improving process verticals. Full year segment margins remained at about 20%, including close to $30 million of onetime accelerated investments, mostly in our Software & Control segment. R&D expense was up 14% compared to fiscal '20, and R&D as a percent of sales increased further to 6% of sales in fiscal '21.  \n Our core automation, which excludes the impact -- excuse me, our core conversion, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, currency and our accelerated onetime investments, was 34%. Corporate & Other was up just over $20 million, mostly related to acquisition costs associated with the Plex acquisition. Adjusted EPS was up 20%. A detailed year-over-year adjusted EPS Walk can be found in the appendix for your reference.  \n Free cash flow performance remained strong and was in line with our July expectations. Free cash flow conversion was 103% of adjusted income. Finally, ROIC remained well above our target of over 20%. \n For the year, we deployed about $3.3 billion of capital towards acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases in fiscal '21. Our capital structure and liquidity remains strong.  \n Let's move on to the next slide, 15, guidance for fiscal '22. As Blake mentioned, we are expecting sales of about $8.2 billion in fiscal '22, up 17.5% at the midpoint of the range. We expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 14% to 17% and about 15.5% at the midpoint of our range. This outlook includes our latest assumptions on supply chain constraints.  \n We expect full year segment operating margins to be about 21.5%. We expect positive price/cost for the full year from the additional price increase we implemented this month. At the midpoint of our guidance, assumes full year core earnings conversion of between 30% and 35%. We believe we are in the early stages of a cycle of sustained growth and are making investments to fuel this growth in '22 and beyond. Our fiscal '22 segment margin and core conversion outlook includes our plan to increase R&D and other growth-related investments by double digits.  \n We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. We do not anticipate any material discrete items to impact tax in fiscal '22. This rate is under current tax law. Should tax laws change, we would provide an updated outlook with the impacts from these changes.  \n Our adjusted EPS guidance is $10.50 to $11.10. This compares to fiscal '21 adjusted EPS of $9.43. At the midpoint of the range, this represents 15% adjusted EPS growth. I will cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS Walk on the next page.  \n From a calendarization viewpoint, based on our current supply chain availability, we expect our first quarter sales to be relatively flat compared to our Q4 of fiscal '21. Following the first quarter, we expect sequential sales to improve over the balance of the year. We expect segment margins and the adjusted EPS to decline sequentially in Q1 and then improve throughout the year in line with our sales volume and the timing of price increases. We anticipate recent price increases to having more substantial benefit in subsequent quarters given the timing of when customer agreements are renewed throughout the year.  \n Also as a reminder, fiscal '21 Q1 included a nonrecurring $0.45 gain related to the settlement of a legal matter. Finally, we expect full year fiscal '22 free cash flow conversion of about 90% of adjusted income. This reflects a $155 million bonus payout for the fiscal '21 performance, $165 million of capital expenditures and funding higher levels of working capital to support higher sales. Our working capital is targeted to be aligned with our historic amount of about 12% of sales.  \n A few comments -- additional comments on fiscal '22 guidance. Corporate & Other expense is expected to be around $125 million. Net interest expense for fiscal '22 is expected to be about $115 million. And finally, we're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 117.5 million shares.  \n The next slide, 16, provides the adjusted EPS Walk from fiscal '21 to fiscal '22 guidance at the midpoint. Moving from left to right, core performance is expected to contribute $2.15. This includes the benefit of higher organic sales. We anticipate price realization will exceed input cost inflation by about $0.10. Our pricing philosophy is built on the high value that we bring our customers. In light of increasing input costs, we have taken several price adjustments this year to mitigate, and we are prepared to take additional price actions as needed.  \n The removal of the onetime accelerated investments made in fiscal year '21 will be about a $0.20 benefit. The onetime gain from a legal matter that was settled in the prior year is a $0.45 headwind. Plex will be a $0.15 tailwind in fiscal '22, including the impact of incremental interest. We have included further information showing the impact of Plex in both fiscal '21 and fiscal '22 in our appendix. No real significant changes to what we showed in July. We expect about a $0.05 impact coming from share dilution, and the higher tax rate is expected to be about a $0.75 headwind.  \n Moving on to the next slide, 17, I'll make a few comments on our capital deployment framework. Our long-term capital deployment priorities remain the same. Our first priority is organic growth. After that, we focus capital deployment on inorganic activities. And then we focus on capital returns to shareholders, through our dividends and then share repurchases.  \n In addition to our organic and inorganic investments, our capital deployment plans for fiscal '22 include a focus on delevering, dividends of about $520 million and share repurchases of $100 million.  \n In summary, our guidance assumes a combination of order and backlog growth that drives 15.5% organic sales at the midpoint and reaches the total sales of over $8 billion. We continue to offset inflationary pressures through additional price actions yielding segment margins of 21.5%. We expect adjusted EPS growth of 15% and continued strong free cash flow.  \n With that, I'll turn it over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start the Q&A. Yes, I'll just add a couple of things, Scott. Our pricing philosophy is built on this high value we are bringing to our customers. And what we're seeing with increasing input costs, we have taken several price adjustments in fiscal year '21. And we're prepared to take additional price actions as needed if input costs increased more than what we're anticipating at this point. So we do command premium prices in the market. It's reflected in our margins. And we continue to focus on the value we are creating for our customers and the relationships we have there. Yes, Jeff, we had a little over 1% price growth in fiscal year '21, and we're projecting an approximately 2% net price growth in '22. However, I will be quick to caution that is based on our current level of cost increases. We are prepared to increase that more if we see additional cost increases coming in that we haven't anticipated in our latest price adjustments. Yes. Jeff, that is accretive to our margins because it's not growing at the same pace as our sales, but it is in the -- as I said, double digits. It's from the low double digits. And Jeff, just to put some color on it, we see ourselves in the early stages of a cycle of sustained growth. And we are making investments in '22 to fuel that growth both in '22 and then beyond. And so we are increasing our spending in '22 on R&D and other growth-related investments.  \n Some of the places we're investing, Jeff, we're investing in some key products and software development projects, mostly in Software & Control. We're investing in customer-facing selling resources, and the addition of some travel and customer-facing expenses that had gone down during the pandemic. And we're also expanding investments in our plant capacity. So those are some of the big areas, Jeff, where you're seeing investment spend increase in '22. Yes, Jeff, what we are seeing is our Q1 sequential with Q4, that's really based -- from a revenue standpoint, it's based on what we are anticipating from supply chain constraints and that, that will be keeping our revenue flat as we move from Q4 into Q1.  \n From a margin standpoint and an EPS perspective, some of our price increases that we have implemented will be impacting the later quarters of '22 more than they will be impacting the first quarter of '22. So part of what I'm sharing, as I say, what we expect for margin in the first quarter of '22 is impacted by the timing of price increases -- impacting our revenue and our margins as we go through the year. We also expect that cost increases from a year-on-year perspective will be most pronounced in our first quarter. And then from an EPS perspective, I will just point out first quarter of last year, we had a $0.45 gain from a legal settlement, and that will not be repeating. Yes. Julian, the biggest story in the 90% free cash flow conversion for us in '22 is really the higher revenues and that's -- and the working capital that we're putting in place to go with those higher revenues. That's the single biggest thing. \n Secondary things that we are seeing, Julian, are the payout of our bonus in '22 related to the '21 performance. And then we're also increasing our CapEx investment in light of the higher demand for our products. But no, in terms of our mix and anything going on from that perspective, that's not really having an impact, Julian. So Steve, we had approximately $30 million of onetime spend that we did in fiscal year '21. That's not repeating. Then to our total fiscal year '22 of the roughly $2 billion of investment spend, that's what we're saying is going up double digits in '22, low double digits actually. So there's a little over $200 million of increase there in investment spend. We have some onetimes that impacted us in fiscal year '21 that we're pointing out that those will not repeat. Also, the tax rate is based on current tax law. If this tax law does change, we would update what we expect for that. But Steve, those are a couple of the things I'd just point out. Markus, the significant majority of our backlog, we are not repricing. There is a relatively small portion of our backlog that has more dynamic prices that we can adjust. So we are not changing the prices in our product backlog.  \n But as Blake mentioned earlier, when we look at our total backlog and as we work through some of that in '22, it's favorable. It's favorable in terms of the mix that we're seeing there. So we don't expect it to be dilutive. We actually expect it to be accretive to us in '22."

Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would now like to turn the call over to Jessica Kourakos, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Kourakos, please go ahead.\nJessica Kourakos: Thanks Rene. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's Third Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO and Nick Gangestad, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include and our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call. Supplemental information related to our new business segments can be also found in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website.  Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. So, with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake.\nBlake Moret: Thanks Jessica and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before I begin let me first congratulate our Milwaukee Bucks for such an incredible season, Go Bucks. Let me now take a moment to talk about a couple of key highlights in the quarter. First of all, I'm pleased to welcome Cyril Perducat as our new Chief Technology Officer. He succeeds Sujeet Chand who is retiring later this year after a long and very impactful career at Rockwell and I'll talk more about his legacy in November. Cyril brings a wealth of automation and digital transformation experience to the role with great global experience and a passion for helping customers. His mindset and additional perspective will help drive even more value from the combination of our core automation, software, and managed services offerings to provide positive outcomes for customers.  We also announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Plex Systems which we expect to close in Q4 of this year. Plex is the leading cloud-native smart manufacturing platform operating at scale and it will be a big part of our FactoryTalk software as a service offering. We look forward to showcasing its unique capabilities and integration into a complete production system at Investor Day during our November Automation Fair in Houston.  Now let's turn to our quarterly results on Slide 3. We saw another quarter of exceptional demand across our product portfolio. Total orders surpassed $2 billion reflecting a very strong demand pipeline. Total revenue of over $1.8 billion hit a new record and grew 33% including a one-point contribution from recent acquisitions including ASEM, Kalypso, and Fiix. Organic sales grew 26% versus prior year despite significant supply chain challenges. The manufacturing supply chain continues to remain constrained due to increased levels of demand and persistent electronic component shortages. It's a dynamic situation that we are monitoring closely. Our global supply chain organization continues to navigate these challenges and is taking a variety of measures investing in both short and long-term strategies to increase our supply chain resiliency.  I will now comment on our top line performance by business segment. Intelligent Devices organic sales increased 29% led by strong broad based demand for our automation products. From the orders perspective this is the third consecutive quarter of record order intake in this segment. Once again strong order growth in motion was driven by our independent cart technology offering which saw over 100% orders growth in the quarter. Independent cart orders growth was broad based and included strong wins in e-commerce and warehouse automation including Interlocks, an important North American material handling OEM partner whose machines are supporting some of the largest e- commerce applications in the world. Interlocks is leveraging our independent cart technology and a high bottleneck area of their process was able to realize a 30% increase in sortation throughput.  Software and control organic sales grew 32% led by strong demand across this segment. Logix sales grew over 40% versus the prior year and was our strongest major product family. Orders for the software and control business segment grew over 55% year-over-year showing strong momentum. In lifecycle services, organic sales increased 17% versus the prior year and increased 8% sequentially. Book-to-bill for this segment of 1.18 is expected to drive continued sequential sales improvement in this segment through the fourth quarter. Total company backlog grew by over 50% year-over-year.  Turning to profitability, segment operating margin of 20% increased by 340 basis points versus the prior year primarily due to higher sales. Adjusted EPS of $2.31 grew 75% and was above our expectations. Stronger sales and favorable mix all contributed to our strong profit performance in the quarter as we continued to increase our business resiliency and make technology and people investments that set us up for a strong future.  Turning to Information Solutions and Connected Services, which represent many of Rockwell\u2019s newest digital revenue streams, we had another great quarter. Organic sales and orders grew strong double digits, with contributions across a variety of end markets. Recent orders also include a number of meaningful software and infrastructure-as-a-service wins with some of the world\u2019s most important Food & Beverage and Life Sciences manufacturers. For example, SINOVAC, one of the largest pharmaceutical manufacturers in China, recently chose our PharmaSuite MES to help bolster production of their vaccines. We also had a great win with GE Renewable Energy on a greenfield project to develop a major power plant in Africa. Once operational, this hydro plant is expected to provide 30% of the country\u2019s energy demand, while reducing annual power generation costs by $100 million. In addition to using our core automation products, our capabilities in industrial cybersecurity helped us win even greater share of this greenfield project. Kalypso also continues to play a very important role within our Connected Services offerings, and last week received PTC\u2019s systems integrator Partner of the Year award. This is in addition to Rockwell receiving PTC\u2019s overall Partner of the Year Award, as we continue to see good synergies across the PTC-Rockwell portfolio.  Turning to Slide 4. At last year's Investor Day, we talked about how we are bringing our FactoryTalk software offering to the cloud with SaaS offerings in three key areas: FactoryTalk Design Hub, FactoryTalk Operations Hub, and our FactoryTalk Maintenance Hub. The organic development of our FactoryTalk Design Hub is well underway and complements our best-in-class Studio 5000 software. With the addition of Plex, we will have a world-class, full scale FactoryTalk Operations Hub. Plex's smart manufacturing platform includes one of the most advanced cloud-native MES offerings available as well as cloud-native quality and supply chain management solutions. Capabilities like inventory management, supply chain optimization, and track and trace are more critical than ever, and we will have unmatched on-premise, and cloud-native solutions.  Last week, we also announced our partnership with Kezzler, a leading provider of cloud-based traceability software that will be a great complement to both our on-prem and cloud-native supply chain offerings. The foundation of our FactoryTalk Maintenance Hub comes from last year's acquisition of Fiix, an AI-enabled maintenance management platform, with a cloud-native offering that is sold 100% on a subscription basis. Since the acquisition, we've seen accelerated growth at Fiix, including the addition of their first two customers with contributions of over $1 million of annual recurring revenue each. This quarter, Fiix revenue grew by over 40% both year-over-year and sequentially, and they\u2019ve added on average, over 50 new logos per month since they\u2019ve joined Rockwell. Fiix and Plex applications are highly complementary, with many opportunities for customers to further improve manufacturing productivity, product quality, and asset utilization.  In addition, we believe that Fiix\u2019s high velocity, go-to-market model will provide additional revenue synergies in the years ahead. As we mentioned on the call to announce the Plex deal, we are moving fast, because manufacturers are picking up the pace of innovation; and we have the opportunity to leap ahead with new value from highly scalable, easy to use, and well-integrated information solutions that build on our rock-solid heritage, born in the world of real-time data.  Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 5 where I\u2019ll provide a few highlights of our Q3 end-market performance. Figures are for organic sales. We had great performance in our Discrete industry segment, with roughly 40% sales growth. Within this industry segment, automotive sales grew at about 50%, led by an increase in capital project activity. We estimate two-thirds of the capital projects we are winning are related to EV projects taking flight. For example, we had another win at the Indian automotive supplier Wipro-PARI, where our core automation technology will be used in an EV battery pack assembly line for one of North America\u2019s largest automotive brand owners.  In Semiconductor, we grew about 35%. We believe strong secular tailwinds, increasing capital spend, and broadening share of wallet with customers are all driving our growth. We are raising our Semiconductor growth outlook once again to high teens for the year. Another highlight within Discrete was our performance in e-commerce, with sales growing approximately 65% versus prior year. This vertical has significant secular tailwinds with pure play ecommerce players, as well as traditional retailers, that are transforming their warehouses through automation.  Turning now to our Hybrid industry segment. These verticals also had a terrific quarter. Food & Beverage grew over 30% and had the most significant outperformance relative to our expectations, as customers prioritize investing in technologies that help them differentiate their offerings and maximize their growth. We believe we are taking share in this market and that our technical and commercial strength is reaping dividends that should carry through into fiscal 2022. Life Sciences grew over 40% in Q3 and was another great performer in the quarter. Life Sciences was our fourth largest industry in the quarter, not far behind Automotive, and we continue to believe we are taking share in this fast-growing vertical. Key wins included a highly competitive win for a large greenfield project with Butantan to fast-track their Covid-19 vaccine production in Brazil. Here our PlantPAX Control System, Factory Talk Batch, and PharmaSuite MES will enable a best-in-class paperless system that will fully integrate with batch control and other equipment on the factory floor.  Our fastest growing vertical in the Hybrid segment was Tire, which was up about 60% in the quarter. Key wins included Toyo Tire Group in Japan, where Rockwell was chosen as the automation standard for their plant in Serbia. Our core automation technology, our IoT-ready architecture, and strong MES capability were all critical factors in securing this key win. Tire has always been a strong industry vertical for Rockwell and our technologies are actively supporting our customers\u2019 increasing investments in innovation and production capacity. Process markets were up approximately 15% and were better than expected. This was the first quarter where we saw all of our major process industry verticals return to positive growth, including Oil & Gas, which grew low single digits versus the prior year, and grew high single digits sequentially.  Turning now to Slide 6, and our Q3 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales grew by 29% versus the prior year, with strong double-digit growth across all three industry segments. EMEA sales increased 21%, driven by strength in Food & Beverage and Tire. Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 23%, with broad-based growth led by Semiconductor, Life Sciences, and Tire. In China, we saw double-digit growth driven by strength in Tire, Life Sciences and EV. We continue to expect growth in China will exceed the company average for the year, as our longer cycle businesses kick in. Latin America growth of 26% was led by Food & Beverage and Automotive.  Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 7 to review highlights for the full-year outlook. Orders momentum and backlog are expected to drive strong sales growth in the balance of the year and into fiscal 2022. Our higher top line guidance is driven by improvements in our Hybrid and Process industry segments. Our new outlook for total reported sales growth is up 12%, including 8% organic growth versus the prior year. We are seeing strong growth in both Core automation as well as Information Solutions and Connected Services. Acquisitions are contributing over a point of profitable growth. We are increasing our margin expectation to 20%. Our new adjusted EPS target of $9.20 at the midpoint of the range represents 17% growth compared to the prior year. This also includes $0.15 from transaction fees related to our pending acquisition of Plex. I should add that we expect double-digit Annual Recurring Revenue growth in fiscal 2021, with the Plex acquisition expected to add over $175 million to our ARR totals next fiscal year.  A more detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 8. I won\u2019t go into the details on this slide, but as you can see, we continue to expect broad-based organic sales growth this year. With that, let me now turn it over to Nick who will elaborate on our third quarter performance and updated financial outlook for fiscal 2021. Nick? \nNick Gangestad: Thank you, Blake, and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll start on Slide 9, third quarter key financial information. Third quarter reported sales were up 33% over last year. Organic sales were up 26%. Acquisitions contributed one point of growth, and currency translation increased sales by five points. Segment operating margin was 19.9%, an expansion of 340 basis points compared to Q3 of last year. Higher sales volume, a favorable mix, and price all contributed to our margin expansion. These factors more than offset higher incentive compensation, our planned investment spend, last year\u2019s pay reductions, and higher input costs. Corporate and Other expense was $29 million, slightly higher than last year, mainly driven by costs related to the pending Plex acquisition.  The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was 14.6% compared to 14.1% last year. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $2.31, above our expectations, primarily related to higher sales. I\u2019ll cover a year-over-year Adjusted EPS bridge for Q3 on a later slide. Free cash flow was $437 million or conversion of 161% in the quarter. Strong conversion in the quarter was driven by continued management of our working capital. Year-to-date, free cash flow conversion was 118% and free cash flow dollars was up 39% versus last year. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased 225,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $60 million. For the full year, we have lowered our repurchase target from $350 million to $300 million, in anticipation of our upcoming Plex transaction. At June 30th, $613 million remained available under our repurchase authorization.  Slide 10 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. The Intelligent Devices segment had organic sales growth of 29% in the quarter. Segment margin was 21.9%, 500 basis points higher than last year, mainly due to higher sales. This segment did see higher input costs both year-over-year and sequentially, however these costs were largely offset by price. We once again had strong orders performance in the quarter. Intelligent Devices orders grew approximately 65% led by North America and EMEA demand.  Software & Control segment organic sales grew 32% in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed three points to growth. Segment margin was 25.2%, which was 270 basis points above last year. The margin benefit from higher sales was partially offset by higher investment spend. These investments relate primarily to software development and additional sales resources to drive revenue growth in fiscal year 2022 and beyond. Software & Control orders also grew strong double digits led by Logix, which grew double digits in all regions. Organic sales of the Lifecycle Services segment grew 17% year-over-year, led by Life Sciences, Food & Beverage, and Semiconductor. Acquisitions contributed about 1.5% to growth. Operating margin for this segment was 10.3%, an increase of 60 basis points compared to last year. This increase was primarily due to higher sales partially offset by the reinstatement of incentive compensation. Third quarter book-to-bill performance for the Lifecycle Services segment was 1.18.  The next Slide 11, provides the ADJUSTED EPS walk from Q3 fiscal 2020 to Q3 fiscal 2021. Starting on the left. Core performance had a positive impact of approximately $1.65, primarily due to higher sales and favorable mix. We did see higher input costs this quarter compared to a year ago, which we have been offsetting with targeted price increases throughout the year. Approximately, $0.10 was related to non-recurring accelerated investments that we announced earlier this year. These investments are mostly in our Software & Control segment. Currency contributed about $0.05. Incentive compensation, and the reversal of the temporary pay reductions, was a year-over-year headwind of approximately $0.55, of which bonus was $0.40 and temporary pay actions $0.15. As a reminder, there was no bonus expense in Q3 of fiscal 2020. Acquisitions were about $0.05 dilutive as we expected.  Moving to Slide 12, quarterly product order trends. This slide shows our average daily order trends for our products, which includes our software portfolio. The trends shown here account for about two-thirds of our overall sales. Order intake improved again this quarter. Q3 product order levels grew year-on-year as well as sequentially and are at an all-time high; particularly strong areas were in Logix and Motion. Not included on this slide are orders for the Lifecycle Services segment, which were up double digits in the quarter both sequentially and year-over-year. The overall strong order performance resulted in total company backlog of over $2 billion, growing over 50% year-over-year.  This takes us to Slide 13, updated guidance. We are increasing our organic sales growth outlook to 8%, which is a one-point increase from the previous mid-point of 7%. We expect currency translation to now contribute about 2.5 points to growth, and we still expect acquisitions to contribute about 1.5%. In total, we are forecasting reported sales to be about $7.1 billion or up 12%. We have also updated the adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $9.10 to $9.30. This new range now includes about $0.15 of transaction fees related to the pending Plex acquisition. I\u2019ll review the bridge from the prior guidance mid-point of $9.15 to the new mid-point of $9.20 on the next slide.  Segment operating margin is now expected to be approximately 20%. This represents a 50-basis point increase from prior guidance and primarily reflects higher sales partially offset by additional bonus expense. We continue to expect positive price/costs for the full year. Our adjusted effective tax rate is still expected to be about 14%, the same as prior guidance. This includes a 200-basis point annual benefit related to discrete items which we expect to realize in Q4. We believe our normalized adjusted effective tax rate is around 18%. Given our strong generation of free cash flow through the first three quarters, we are now projecting free cash flow conversion to be above 105% of adjusted income. A few additional comments on fiscal 2021 guidance. Corporate and Other Expense is expected to be about $135 million, and now includes about $20 million primarily from the transaction-related fees and expenses anticipated for the pending acquisition of Plex. Net interest expense for fiscal 2021 is now expected to be about $95 million to $100 million and now reflects the expected incremental interest of about $5 million related to new debt for the pending acquisition of Plex. Finally, we\u2019re assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 117.1 million shares.  This takes us to Slide 14. This slide bridges the mid-point of our April adjusted EPS guidance range to the mid-point of our new guidance. Starting on the left, there is a higher contribution from core operating performance, primarily due to the higher organic sales and increase in margin. The contribution from currency is now expected to be $0.05 higher compared to prior guidance. Next, given the increase in guidance, there is about a $0.15 impact from higher bonus expense. Full-year bonus expense is now expected to be approximately $175 million. Given our projected full year performance this bonus is higher than the initial fiscal year 2021 target of about approximately $115 million. For comparison, this was zero for fiscal year 2020. Finally, we now have about a $0.15 impact coming from the pending acquisition of Plex, which we anticipate will close in Q4. This brings the new midpoint of the guidance range to $9.20.  Finally, a few more comments on Plex, turning now to page 15. Plex will be reported in our Software & Control segment and be a part of our Information Solutions & Connected Services portfolio of offerings. We are forecasting that in fiscal year 2022, it will generate $175 million of ARR, $160 million of revenue after the adjustment for deferred revenue, and a neutral impact to earnings per share. About $0.35 of incremental EPS from operations is forecasted to fully offset the deferred revenue adjustment, integration expenses, and incremental interest expense. We expect fiscal year 2023 revenues to be above $200 million with a meaningful contribution to EPS in fiscal year 2023. We have included further details in the appendix on the financial impact of Plex in fiscal year 2021 and 2022. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Blake for some additional comments. \nBlake Moret : Thanks, Nick. Once again, strong order trends and record backlog underpin a robust top line outlook, and we have confidence in our team\u2019s ability to navigate the supply chain challenges. And we continue to invest in our future. The combination of our software portfolio with our controllers, Intelligent Devices, and Lifecycle Services creates unique value for customers across Discrete, Hybrid, and Process end markets. Our momentum would not be possible without the tremendous efforts of our employees. I\u2019d like to thank everyone at Rockwell, and particularly the people in our Integrated Supply Chain organization, who have done a great job managing pandemic challenges and now mitigating our sourcing constraints. We\u2019re leveraging our own manufacturing expertise to help customers be more resilient, agile, and sustainable. Let me now pass the baton back to Jessica and we\u2019ll begin the Q&A session. \nJessica Kourakos : Thanks Blake. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Rene, let's take our first question. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to understand, first of all, how we should be thinking about operating leverage over the let's say the next sort of 12 to 18 months, realizing the current quarter there is a heavy headwind from incentive compensation, and probably some headwinds as well from trying to manage supply chain constraints and component costs. Just wondered how quickly those sorts of items you think should fade as we move beyond this current fiscal quarter and when you look at the business mix, how we should think about sort of operating leverage, please?\nBlake Moret: Hey Julian, first, just to around out 2021 as far as operating leverage, and we often at Rockwell talk about our core conversion, we see full year 2021 being right in the range of the 30% to 35% core conversion that we often talk about. As far as thinking about the future, of course, we'll say more about that in November at our Investor Day. But like one way to think about it is, there's several things, nothing drives our operating margin like top line growth, and given our 30% to 35% core conversion, we think that's still a helpful way to think about it. And that implies that we would expect our margins to expand next year. But of course, I'm going to give -- we will give more detail about that at our Investor Day in November.\nJulian Mitchell: Perfect, thanks very much. And then just, as we're thinking about the automotive end market within Discrete, very, very strong growth of 50% I think you delivered in the third quarter year-on-year, just wondered if you could update us sort of as you're looking into 2022, what portion of your backlog, perhaps if there is such a thing in auto is related to EV, and how you think about the sustainability of that auto CAPEX rebounds? \nBlake Moret: Sure. Well, Julian, we think that about two thirds of the capital projects that we're currently seeing in automotive have EV content. And EV power train is quickly passing the power train business we're seeing for internal combustion engines as a part of the mix within automotive. And we see that trend continuing and probably accelerating as new entrants into the EV market, either the established brand owners and then the startups are bringing their products to market. And our sales are, of course, directly to those brand owners, as well as all of the tier suppliers, like Wipro Power that we mentioned a little bit earlier. So around the world, we're very positive, very bullish on our portfolio. And quite frankly, we think Plex is going to help that with tier suppliers, because that's one of their strengths, providing their smart manufacturing platform to tier automotive suppliers. So we see this trend continuing. And we're expecting strength going into the next fiscal year in order. \nJulian Mitchell: Great, thank you. \nBlake Moret: Thanks, Julian.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Your line is open.\nScott Davis: Hey, good morning, guys and Jessica. \nJessica Kourakos: Morning. \nScott Davis: I'm kind of intrigued just to follow-up on Julian's question there. I mean, these EV projects, I mean, how do they compare versus ice and like complexity, and scope? And, any different dynamics, like if are the less suppliers, more suppliers, more competition, less competition, just any additional color you can give there be helpful, I think?\nBlake Moret: Sure. For Rockwell, there's actually upside to an EV project versus a traditional internal combustion engine. So starting with the drive train, a lot of our independent cart technology wins for precision motion control have actually been on the battery and the drive train side, if you will, for EV where traditionally in internal combustion engines, Rockwell has had a smaller content. That may not be true for some of the other suppliers who have a traditional revenue stream for CNC or what have you, but we don't and so we're not losing business in that transition. It's a net positive for us.  On the software side, the EV manufacturers are adopting right from the start MES software as a necessary element of their production scheduling system. And so whereas 10 years ago or so, it was seen as a nice to have, but not necessarily a requirement with these new facilities coming online MES is seen as a necessary part of the bill of material, if you will. And then you combine all the other pieces of putting a vehicle together, that remained the same. So you still have to stamp and paint metal, you assemble the components, you test them at the end of the line, and so on. And those are all applications that Rockwell has good offerings for.  In terms of the competitive landscape, as you would expect, the usual suspects are there in terms of the traditional part of the vehicle manufacturing and assembly. On the battery and in the electric vehicle drive train, very heavy Asian content; China, Japan, Korea. And so I'd say it's even more international with a bias towards Asia in some of those new elements. And we've put together good teams for tracking and pursuing these projects that span across multiple countries.\nScott Davis: That's really helpful. And you've increasingly become more bullish, like on independent cart, kind of almost every call here for the last year. Are there -- how does this scale out, I mean, could you actually do a full Amazon style kind of warehouse and independent cart, is that even possible, does it scale to that size?\nBlake Moret: There's lots more applications within say, an Amazon fulfillment center that can be accomplished through independent cart. Today, those pieces of their overall facility are typically being provided by multiple of our customers. So you don't see necessarily one single sub supplier to them, providing all of the conveyance and sortation, and so on. And so we're working with some of the big ones, of course, whose names you would recognize. But there's also a whole host of integrators and machinery builders with a good idea, though, that Amazon is bringing into their ecosystem. And so we're working with a lot of these smaller suppliers. And I would also add, this isn't just for the big e-commerce giants. Now, this is for the big box retailers who are also looking to automate their material handling, the Walmarts of the world are also looking at these solutions at their individual locations, where they're bringing in tremendous amounts of material to try to get in the right place more efficiently than ever before. But we see almost limitless opportunity just in the e-commerce area for additional adoption of independent cart. And as we've talked about, we see independent cart wins in other applications outside of e-commerce. We see it in Life Sciences, we see it and Food and Beverage Packaging, given scalability and flexibility that manufacturers could never see before. And then we have some, let's say, more unusual applications, like the one we talked about with the U.S. Navy a few quarters ago. \nScott Davis: Excellent. Good luck, guys. Thank you. \nBlake Moret: Thanks Scott.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. \nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning to you. \nBlake Moret: Hey Josh. \nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Just a follow-up on I guess, what might be several questions on orders and backlog. Blake say you have another quarter here with pretty healthy order intake, you reference that that over 2 billion of backlog up a lot year-over-year, anything about this cycle or the complexion of Greenfield and Brownfield that you guys are seeing that would make that shippable over a longer period of time than usual, obviously, you guys have sort of a reputation for being more short cycle, but how is that evolving and over what timeframe would you view that backlog is sort of a shippable number? \nBlake Moret: Yeah, I would I would not look at this backlog as being longer-term shippable based on the mix of industries or projects. The longest backlog orders that we get are typically in solutions, and that's the part of the business that's actually getting a little bit slower to recover. So there's nothing in that mix that would indicate that these backlog increases are due to some, special case with respect to higher project content or what have you. It's really due to just the dramatic surge that we have seen and seen sustained over the last few quarter in orders, coupled with supply chain constraints. But we've given you the color about the individual verticals that it's coming from. And it's a great balance that, it has been across Discrete and Hybrid. And now, the process markets are starting to kick in a bit there. \nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Got it, it's helpful. And then just a follow-up on some of the moving pieces on the cost side for you Nick. I think last quarter or maybe some earlier quarters there was a bit of a talk on some of the investments being kind of frontloaded for 2021 to whether maybe that's a bit more of a tailwind to the 2022. If we had to add up the investments and the incentive comp fees, is that something that leveled out on a normalized basis or is there still some kind of catch up or get back where you start off next year in the plus column?\nNick Gangestad: Yeah, Josh, in terms of our investments for full year 2021, we expect our total investments to go up about 2% for the full year. And that's really more back end loaded. I said last quarter, that we expected year-on-year the investments to go up between $90 million and $100 million, compared to the second half of 2020. Our best estimate now is it's going to go up $85 million year-on-year for the second half. So I'd call it more back end loaded than front end loaded up of our investments. And then in terms of investment spending next year, Josh, again it's early, but I don't see any reason to think that it would not be fairly evenly spread over the year. I don't see any big seasonality impacting next year in our investment spend.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Thanks. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is open. \nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning guys. \nBlake Moret: Hey Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Blake, I'm sure you don't want to give us too much on 2022 at this point, but given orders are so much higher and they keep trending up, what kind of confidence at this point do your order trends give you in delivering organic growth in FYI 2022, that could be close to 2021 or at least at or above your two times industrial production target?\nBlake Moret: Well, without saying too much about 2022 until November, we're very positive on where we are. The orders momentum, the backlog that we expect to largely shift as we get closer to normal levels through the balance of the year, our ability to compete and win in competitive projects across the world, and across the verticals. I think it's a great setup. And it should bode well for our growth and performance going into the next year and beyond.\nAndy Kaplowitz: That's helpful and maybe just focusing on process markets, obviously you're seeing especially in chemicals, giving you monthly raise your 2021 forecasts and some improved growth, but you're starting to see more significant improvement yet in oil and gas, what's your confidence level and sort of more of a typical later cycle recovery for process as you go forward?\nBlake Moret: Yeah, we continue to see optimism for oil and gas as it always seems to do lagging the earlier cycle Discrete businesses. But we grew year-over-year and sequentially in oil and gas. We expect another quarter of growth in oil and gas in the fourth quarter. And while there's still a lot of uncertainty, these are projects around the world and we're continuing to watch COVID infections and those are continuing to be a concern for us. We think we're in a good spot with oil and gas and some of the comments from some of the earlier cycle oil and gas operators, the people who are providing drilling technology as well as oilfield services, those generally lead the impact on our business by say six or nine months. And so we are optimistic that some of the early signs that we saw this quarter in oil and gas are going to persist and pick up. \nAndy Kaplowitz: Appreciate it Blake. \nBlake Moret: Yeah, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. \nUnidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. I'm on for Nigel Co. My question will be looking at the investment question again, I was still looking at the 35 million tailwind and for the incentive stores around 30 million for 2022?\nBlake Moret: In terms of the tailwind for 2022, I mean, we're not yet in a position where we're sharing guidance on what we expect investment spend to be for 2022. But our total investment spend this year is going up approximately 2%, very much like our -- what we've seen in prior years. As far as headwinds and tailwind, I didn't quite catch all of that. But, for instance, it would be more likely that our bonus is back in a more normal zone of what I talked about during earlier on this call. That's an example. But I won't necessarily say investments will necessarily go down or not repeat. The one exception is we have temporary investments, these accelerated investments with $30 million, that is going exactly as we anticipated. That's $30 million in the second half of the year, about $10 million of that we spent in the third quarter of $20 million we're anticipating in the fourth quarter. Those will not repeat into 2022 and we did those investments to accelerate our growth in 2022. And then the last point is, as I said earlier with Julian's question, it's our expectation that margins will be expanding in fiscal year 2022.\nUnidentified Analyst : Got you. And another one was that in terms of the orders momentum, you mentioned, it's not as long cycle. Do you have any idea when the conversion will happen into sales?\nBlake Moret: Well, obviously, we're seeing good sales rates that were above our expected expectations in Q3. And that led us to raise the guidance of organic growth at the midpoint for this year. And we expect that we'll be shifting the backlog through the balance of 2022 getting us closer towards, more normal backlog levels. Backlog will be up in Q4 a little bit, but not as market increase as we saw in Q3.\nUnidentified Analyst : Appreciate it. Thank you. \nBlake Moret: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Tusa from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nStephen Tusa: Hi, good morning. \nBlake Moret: Good morning, Steve. \nStephen Tusa: Thanks as usual for all the details. Just wanted to -- maybe I might have missed the comment on incentive comp, what is normal, just mechanically, what do you think is normal incentive comp, kind of relative to the level that you're performing at this year?\nBlake Moret: Yeah, Steve we started the year with our planned compensation, which is what we would consider our normal amounts of $115 million. Given our expectation of exceeding that performance, we're currently expecting total bonus expense this year to be approximately $175 million.\nStephen Tusa: Okay, so just mechanically, we should assume that next year you'd get a $60 million tailwind from that?\nBlake Moret: I think that's a pretty fair assumption.\nStephen Tusa: Okay. And then just for the investments, I mean, so should we kind of think about investments up 2 and then and then remove the 30 million, so is that kind of the profile for investments going forward, at least, for next year?\nBlake Moret: You know, in terms of the investments, yeah, the 30 million you should think of that is something that we're not planning to repeat. But we still haven't given our guidance here. We're working through a lot of things of how we want to, what we want to invest on in 2022. But yes, your assumption of taking 30 million out of what we've done this year, that's the way we've been saying that and I agree with that approach.\nStephen Tusa: Okay, so something like it's like 60 million plus, the 30 million and then we have to kind of make up our minds on how much kind of the core investment account goes up and that's kind of the profile for those costs?\nBlake Moret: I think the best way is to look to November when we're going to be able to provide more detail for this. \nStephen Tusa: Okay, I won't ask you for the date of that. That would be the follow up but one more question for you just on this orders. Sorry, on the Plex deal. That's a pretty big growth number in 2023, is there something to do with the accounting around deferred revenues on that front because 30% seems to be a pretty dramatic acceleration as to where this company has been in the past? And then how much of their revenue is actually like, pure MES that's really kind of detached from their kind of ERP core? And thanks for the details again.\nBlake Moret: Yeah, just so a couple of things. I'll start and Nick may have some additional comments. First of all, the figure in 2023 is after the adjusted adjustments for deferred revenue, that impact the revenue in 2021, and 2022. So you don't see the deferred revenue adjustment in 2023. So we're not looking for 30% top line growth in 2023. But we will not be seeing the deferred revenue adjustments carrying into that year. And then in terms of the mix of Plex\u2019s offering. So they offer a modular smart manufacturing platform, and it has ERP, it has MES, it has quality management, it has supply chain. And so particularly when you're talking to small and medium sized manufacturers, now they don't have big, centralized engineering resources to take a bunch of disparate software applications, and hope that they knit together. And so Plex offers an integrated suite of those modules. MES is a large portion of it, they have ERP and those other applications I mentioned, but they've done some good work over the last couple of years to modularize their offerings, so that a customer isn't forced to buy what they don't want. We will continue to support all these applications for the customers who've already bought them. And we're going to be helping Plex as they expand the introduction of the offering outside of the U.S., as well as to other industries, like food and beverage and pharmaceuticals, that they haven't had as much exposure to in the past. \nStephen Tusa: Got it. \nNick Gangestad: Hey Steve, just to make sure you're seeing it in the appendix, we've provided some additional detailed breaking out 2022, for Plex and that shows the underlying revenue and then the deferred revenue adjustment or actually a range on that that we're anticipating. That we provide that so you can put it in context of how to think about that growth that we're showing. \nStephen Tusa: Right. That's super helpful. Okay, thanks a lot.\nOperator: We have one last question from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. \nNoah Kaye: Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. I guess just following up on that, would love to hear some of the responses that you've been getting to the Plex announcement, both from the customer base and internally. And I think there have been some questions about on-prem versus cloud migration for a lot of these manufacturing customers. You've got another arrow coming in the quiver but you also have your own broad portfolio of offerings, some of which are, of course, legacy, and prime, and some of which are moving to the cloud. So can you just talk a little about the responses and what you think customers are going to be trying to figure out and how you think you can help them over the coming quarters and years?\nBlake Moret: Sure, Noah, thanks for the question. Look, on the day that we announced it, I got a lot of unsolicited feedback from both employees and customers that I've developed relationships with over the years. And they were really excited, thrilled about what we were bringing in. They felt like it made great sense and it added what we can offer to compliment the core automation that they've been buying from us for years or in some cases, where they're trying to decide who their digital transformation partner is. With this, what we have, and this is something we've talked about for a long time, an approach that meets customers where they are on their journey. We're still going to sell a lot of on-premise software. And customers have made investments there and they want to see a migration path. And our MES orders have production center based MES continue to grow and those orders get larger, and we continue to see lots of runway for that software for customers who have decided they want an on-premise solution.  But we have the opportunity for customers who have made a decision that they're going to start working with these applications with cloud native software. And they're ready to start working there, to build on Plex\u2019s great customer base and introduce it to those customers who said, they're ready to look at that as well. And so having that approach, it all comes back to that theme of an open approach where we're not forcing one philosophy down a customer's throat. And we're telling them, we can meet them where they are on their journey. We'd like for that data to be coming from Rockwell core automation components but as we've talked about before, a lot of this software we fully expect is going to give us a way in into competitive strongholds where we're not currently the supplier of the core automation. And we're going to be providing the value at the software and then working on the automation pieces as well. So it's going to be a bold approach and we're thrilled about the new ways to win that Plex gives us.\nNoah Kaye: Okay, thanks, Blake. Let me ask one more question. I don't think it was addressed too much on this call, but you mentioned both in the press release and I think it in the prepared remarks, some of the supply chain constraints, and I was wondering if we can get a little bit more color around where you see the supply chain pressures really still manifesting for Rockwell internally, and what that looks like over the coming couple of quarters? But then also, if you can just touch on what impact this is maybe still having on demand, I mean, I got to imagine for any ops or production planner, is this reramp is like drinking from a firehose every day. And so just wondering to what extent you're seeing your customers demand or kind of CAPEX plans somewhat being held back by just the challenges of the ramping?\nBlake Moret: Sure. So in the quarter, we saw a little bit of an impact on supply chain in automotive, MRO. It was a small amount and we did not see that affecting capital projects or other industries. And we still believe that while this is something that our customers, operations, and supply chain organizations are going to continue to be working on for the foreseeable future, it's not going to crimp the supply going forward. And in fact, it's probably lessening with respect to automotive from what we may have seen earlier in the year. The part of the supply chain constraints that we're thinking about are in terms of converting our own backlog. And I've mentioned specifically that our supply chain organization, I think, is doing a terrific job navigating this, but it's not going to be over in the next quarter. We're going to continue to be dealing with these supply chain constraints for the foreseeable future and we're looking at how do we deal with these on a short term basis, but also on a longer term basis. And I would say electronic components are a piece of that. Some of this is, just simply brought on by the extremely sharp recovery in demand that we've seen, and that we continue to see in orders. But then there's also the labor and we have to make sure that we're a great destination for labor, in our plants, in our supply chain organization, in our development teams and so on across the organization. Because as you know, it's a very hard, it's a very active labor market right now. Again, I think we're doing a great job with that. We have really good collaboration across all parts of the organization to make sure that we're pulling together so that when people are considering Rockwell as a destination, that we come out on top. So it's those two areas, I would say, but again, in terms of the demand, we're really not seeing a significant dampening of demand brought on by our customers supply chain constraints. \nNoah Kaye: That's extremely helpful. Thanks so much. \nBlake Moret: Yeah. Thanks, Noah.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over back to Ms. Kourakos. \nJessica Kourakos: Thanks Rene. Well, thanks everyone for joining us today. I know it's a very, very busy day for earnings, but we appreciate your interest and support and we'll see you all, we will see you soon. \nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. At this time, you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nick Gangestad",
            "content": "Thank you, Blake, and good morning everyone. I'll start on Slide 9, third quarter key financial information. Third quarter reported sales were up 33% over last year. Organic sales were up 26%. Acquisitions contributed one point of growth, and currency translation increased sales by five points. Segment operating margin was 19.9%, an expansion of 340 basis points compared to Q3 of last year. Higher sales volume, a favorable mix, and price all contributed to our margin expansion. These factors more than offset higher incentive compensation, our planned investment spend, last year's pay reductions, and higher input costs. Corporate and Other expense was $29 million, slightly higher than last year, mainly driven by costs related to the pending Plex acquisition.  The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was 14.6% compared to 14.1% last year. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $2.31, above our expectations, primarily related to higher sales. I'll cover a year-over-year Adjusted EPS bridge for Q3 on a later slide. Free cash flow was $437 million or conversion of 161% in the quarter. Strong conversion in the quarter was driven by continued management of our working capital. Year-to-date, free cash flow conversion was 118% and free cash flow dollars was up 39% versus last year. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased 225,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $60 million. For the full year, we have lowered our repurchase target from $350 million to $300 million, in anticipation of our upcoming Plex transaction. At June 30th, $613 million remained available under our repurchase authorization.  Slide 10 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. The Intelligent Devices segment had organic sales growth of 29% in the quarter. Segment margin was 21.9%, 500 basis points higher than last year, mainly due to higher sales. This segment did see higher input costs both year-over-year and sequentially, however these costs were largely offset by price. We once again had strong orders performance in the quarter. Intelligent Devices orders grew approximately 65% led by North America and EMEA demand.  Software & Control segment organic sales grew 32% in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed three points to growth. Segment margin was 25.2%, which was 270 basis points above last year. The margin benefit from higher sales was partially offset by higher investment spend. These investments relate primarily to software development and additional sales resources to drive revenue growth in fiscal year 2022 and beyond. Software & Control orders also grew strong double digits led by Logix, which grew double digits in all regions. Organic sales of the Lifecycle Services segment grew 17% year-over-year, led by Life Sciences, Food & Beverage, and Semiconductor. Acquisitions contributed about 1.5% to growth. Operating margin for this segment was 10.3%, an increase of 60 basis points compared to last year. This increase was primarily due to higher sales partially offset by the reinstatement of incentive compensation. Third quarter book-to-bill performance for the Lifecycle Services segment was 1.18.  The next Slide 11, provides the ADJUSTED EPS walk from Q3 fiscal 2020 to Q3 fiscal 2021. Starting on the left. Core performance had a positive impact of approximately $1.65, primarily due to higher sales and favorable mix. We did see higher input costs this quarter compared to a year ago, which we have been offsetting with targeted price increases throughout the year. Approximately, $0.10 was related to non-recurring accelerated investments that we announced earlier this year. These investments are mostly in our Software & Control segment. Currency contributed about $0.05. Incentive compensation, and the reversal of the temporary pay reductions, was a year-over-year headwind of approximately $0.55, of which bonus was $0.40 and temporary pay actions $0.15. As a reminder, there was no bonus expense in Q3 of fiscal 2020. Acquisitions were about $0.05 dilutive as we expected.  Moving to Slide 12, quarterly product order trends. This slide shows our average daily order trends for our products, which includes our software portfolio. The trends shown here account for about two-thirds of our overall sales. Order intake improved again this quarter. Q3 product order levels grew year-on-year as well as sequentially and are at an all-time high; particularly strong areas were in Logix and Motion. Not included on this slide are orders for the Lifecycle Services segment, which were up double digits in the quarter both sequentially and year-over-year. The overall strong order performance resulted in total company backlog of over $2 billion, growing over 50% year-over-year.  This takes us to Slide 13, updated guidance. We are increasing our organic sales growth outlook to 8%, which is a one-point increase from the previous mid-point of 7%. We expect currency translation to now contribute about 2.5 points to growth, and we still expect acquisitions to contribute about 1.5%. In total, we are forecasting reported sales to be about $7.1 billion or up 12%. We have also updated the adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $9.10 to $9.30. This new range now includes about $0.15 of transaction fees related to the pending Plex acquisition. I'll review the bridge from the prior guidance mid-point of $9.15 to the new mid-point of $9.20 on the next slide.  Segment operating margin is now expected to be approximately 20%. This represents a 50-basis point increase from prior guidance and primarily reflects higher sales partially offset by additional bonus expense. We continue to expect positive price/costs for the full year. Our adjusted effective tax rate is still expected to be about 14%, the same as prior guidance. This includes a 200-basis point annual benefit related to discrete items which we expect to realize in Q4. We believe our normalized adjusted effective tax rate is around 18%. Given our strong generation of free cash flow through the first three quarters, we are now projecting free cash flow conversion to be above 105% of adjusted income. A few additional comments on fiscal 2021 guidance. Corporate and Other Expense is expected to be about $135 million, and now includes about $20 million primarily from the transaction-related fees and expenses anticipated for the pending acquisition of Plex. Net interest expense for fiscal 2021 is now expected to be about $95 million to $100 million and now reflects the expected incremental interest of about $5 million related to new debt for the pending acquisition of Plex. Finally, we're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 117.1 million shares.  This takes us to Slide 14. This slide bridges the mid-point of our April adjusted EPS guidance range to the mid-point of our new guidance. Starting on the left, there is a higher contribution from core operating performance, primarily due to the higher organic sales and increase in margin. The contribution from currency is now expected to be $0.05 higher compared to prior guidance. Next, given the increase in guidance, there is about a $0.15 impact from higher bonus expense. Full-year bonus expense is now expected to be approximately $175 million. Given our projected full year performance this bonus is higher than the initial fiscal year 2021 target of about approximately $115 million. For comparison, this was zero for fiscal year 2020. Finally, we now have about a $0.15 impact coming from the pending acquisition of Plex, which we anticipate will close in Q4. This brings the new midpoint of the guidance range to $9.20.  Finally, a few more comments on Plex, turning now to page 15. Plex will be reported in our Software & Control segment and be a part of our Information Solutions & Connected Services portfolio of offerings. We are forecasting that in fiscal year 2022, it will generate $175 million of ARR, $160 million of revenue after the adjustment for deferred revenue, and a neutral impact to earnings per share. About $0.35 of incremental EPS from operations is forecasted to fully offset the deferred revenue adjustment, integration expenses, and incremental interest expense. We expect fiscal year 2023 revenues to be above $200 million with a meaningful contribution to EPS in fiscal year 2023. We have included further details in the appendix on the financial impact of Plex in fiscal year 2021 and 2022. With that, I'll hand it back to Blake for some additional comments. Yeah, Josh, in terms of our investments for full year 2021, we expect our total investments to go up about 2% for the full year. And that's really more back end loaded. I said last quarter, that we expected year-on-year the investments to go up between $90 million and $100 million, compared to the second half of 2020. Our best estimate now is it's going to go up $85 million year-on-year for the second half. So I'd call it more back end loaded than front end loaded up of our investments. And then in terms of investment spending next year, Josh, again it's early, but I don't see any reason to think that it would not be fairly evenly spread over the year. I don't see any big seasonality impacting next year in our investment spend. Hey Steve, just to make sure you're seeing it in the appendix, we've provided some additional detailed breaking out 2022, for Plex and that shows the underlying revenue and then the deferred revenue adjustment or actually a range on that that we're anticipating. That we provide that so you can put it in context of how to think about that growth that we're showing."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Blake Moret",
            "content": "Thanks Jessica and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before I begin let me first congratulate our Milwaukee Bucks for such an incredible season, Go Bucks. Let me now take a moment to talk about a couple of key highlights in the quarter. First of all, I'm pleased to welcome Cyril Perducat as our new Chief Technology Officer. He succeeds Sujeet Chand who is retiring later this year after a long and very impactful career at Rockwell and I'll talk more about his legacy in November. Cyril brings a wealth of automation and digital transformation experience to the role with great global experience and a passion for helping customers. His mindset and additional perspective will help drive even more value from the combination of our core automation, software, and managed services offerings to provide positive outcomes for customers.  We also announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Plex Systems which we expect to close in Q4 of this year. Plex is the leading cloud-native smart manufacturing platform operating at scale and it will be a big part of our FactoryTalk software as a service offering. We look forward to showcasing its unique capabilities and integration into a complete production system at Investor Day during our November Automation Fair in Houston.  Now let's turn to our quarterly results on Slide 3. We saw another quarter of exceptional demand across our product portfolio. Total orders surpassed $2 billion reflecting a very strong demand pipeline. Total revenue of over $1.8 billion hit a new record and grew 33% including a one-point contribution from recent acquisitions including ASEM, Kalypso, and Fiix. Organic sales grew 26% versus prior year despite significant supply chain challenges. The manufacturing supply chain continues to remain constrained due to increased levels of demand and persistent electronic component shortages. It's a dynamic situation that we are monitoring closely. Our global supply chain organization continues to navigate these challenges and is taking a variety of measures investing in both short and long-term strategies to increase our supply chain resiliency.  I will now comment on our top line performance by business segment. Intelligent Devices organic sales increased 29% led by strong broad based demand for our automation products. From the orders perspective this is the third consecutive quarter of record order intake in this segment. Once again strong order growth in motion was driven by our independent cart technology offering which saw over 100% orders growth in the quarter. Independent cart orders growth was broad based and included strong wins in e-commerce and warehouse automation including Interlocks, an important North American material handling OEM partner whose machines are supporting some of the largest e- commerce applications in the world. Interlocks is leveraging our independent cart technology and a high bottleneck area of their process was able to realize a 30% increase in sortation throughput.  Software and control organic sales grew 32% led by strong demand across this segment. Logix sales grew over 40% versus the prior year and was our strongest major product family. Orders for the software and control business segment grew over 55% year-over-year showing strong momentum. In lifecycle services, organic sales increased 17% versus the prior year and increased 8% sequentially. Book-to-bill for this segment of 1.18 is expected to drive continued sequential sales improvement in this segment through the fourth quarter. Total company backlog grew by over 50% year-over-year.  Turning to profitability, segment operating margin of 20% increased by 340 basis points versus the prior year primarily due to higher sales. Adjusted EPS of $2.31 grew 75% and was above our expectations. Stronger sales and favorable mix all contributed to our strong profit performance in the quarter as we continued to increase our business resiliency and make technology and people investments that set us up for a strong future.  Turning to Information Solutions and Connected Services, which represent many of Rockwell's newest digital revenue streams, we had another great quarter. Organic sales and orders grew strong double digits, with contributions across a variety of end markets. Recent orders also include a number of meaningful software and infrastructure-as-a-service wins with some of the world's most important Food & Beverage and Life Sciences manufacturers. For example, SINOVAC, one of the largest pharmaceutical manufacturers in China, recently chose our PharmaSuite MES to help bolster production of their vaccines. We also had a great win with GE Renewable Energy on a greenfield project to develop a major power plant in Africa. Once operational, this hydro plant is expected to provide 30% of the country's energy demand, while reducing annual power generation costs by $100 million. In addition to using our core automation products, our capabilities in industrial cybersecurity helped us win even greater share of this greenfield project. Kalypso also continues to play a very important role within our Connected Services offerings, and last week received PTC's systems integrator Partner of the Year award. This is in addition to Rockwell receiving PTC's overall Partner of the Year Award, as we continue to see good synergies across the PTC-Rockwell portfolio.  Turning to Slide 4. At last year's Investor Day, we talked about how we are bringing our FactoryTalk software offering to the cloud with SaaS offerings in three key areas: FactoryTalk Design Hub, FactoryTalk Operations Hub, and our FactoryTalk Maintenance Hub. The organic development of our FactoryTalk Design Hub is well underway and complements our best-in-class Studio 5000 software. With the addition of Plex, we will have a world-class, full scale FactoryTalk Operations Hub. Plex's smart manufacturing platform includes one of the most advanced cloud-native MES offerings available as well as cloud-native quality and supply chain management solutions. Capabilities like inventory management, supply chain optimization, and track and trace are more critical than ever, and we will have unmatched on-premise, and cloud-native solutions.  Last week, we also announced our partnership with Kezzler, a leading provider of cloud-based traceability software that will be a great complement to both our on-prem and cloud-native supply chain offerings. The foundation of our FactoryTalk Maintenance Hub comes from last year's acquisition of Fiix, an AI-enabled maintenance management platform, with a cloud-native offering that is sold 100% on a subscription basis. Since the acquisition, we've seen accelerated growth at Fiix, including the addition of their first two customers with contributions of over $1 million of annual recurring revenue each. This quarter, Fiix revenue grew by over 40% both year-over-year and sequentially, and they've added on average, over 50 new logos per month since they've joined Rockwell. Fiix and Plex applications are highly complementary, with many opportunities for customers to further improve manufacturing productivity, product quality, and asset utilization.  In addition, we believe that Fiix's high velocity, go-to-market model will provide additional revenue synergies in the years ahead. As we mentioned on the call to announce the Plex deal, we are moving fast, because manufacturers are picking up the pace of innovation; and we have the opportunity to leap ahead with new value from highly scalable, easy to use, and well-integrated information solutions that build on our rock-solid heritage, born in the world of real-time data.  Let's now turn to Slide 5 where I'll provide a few highlights of our Q3 end-market performance. Figures are for organic sales. We had great performance in our Discrete industry segment, with roughly 40% sales growth. Within this industry segment, automotive sales grew at about 50%, led by an increase in capital project activity. We estimate two-thirds of the capital projects we are winning are related to EV projects taking flight. For example, we had another win at the Indian automotive supplier Wipro-PARI, where our core automation technology will be used in an EV battery pack assembly line for one of North America's largest automotive brand owners.  In Semiconductor, we grew about 35%. We believe strong secular tailwinds, increasing capital spend, and broadening share of wallet with customers are all driving our growth. We are raising our Semiconductor growth outlook once again to high teens for the year. Another highlight within Discrete was our performance in e-commerce, with sales growing approximately 65% versus prior year. This vertical has significant secular tailwinds with pure play ecommerce players, as well as traditional retailers, that are transforming their warehouses through automation.  Turning now to our Hybrid industry segment. These verticals also had a terrific quarter. Food & Beverage grew over 30% and had the most significant outperformance relative to our expectations, as customers prioritize investing in technologies that help them differentiate their offerings and maximize their growth. We believe we are taking share in this market and that our technical and commercial strength is reaping dividends that should carry through into fiscal 2022. Life Sciences grew over 40% in Q3 and was another great performer in the quarter. Life Sciences was our fourth largest industry in the quarter, not far behind Automotive, and we continue to believe we are taking share in this fast-growing vertical. Key wins included a highly competitive win for a large greenfield project with Butantan to fast-track their Covid-19 vaccine production in Brazil. Here our PlantPAX Control System, Factory Talk Batch, and PharmaSuite MES will enable a best-in-class paperless system that will fully integrate with batch control and other equipment on the factory floor.  Our fastest growing vertical in the Hybrid segment was Tire, which was up about 60% in the quarter. Key wins included Toyo Tire Group in Japan, where Rockwell was chosen as the automation standard for their plant in Serbia. Our core automation technology, our IoT-ready architecture, and strong MES capability were all critical factors in securing this key win. Tire has always been a strong industry vertical for Rockwell and our technologies are actively supporting our customers' increasing investments in innovation and production capacity. Process markets were up approximately 15% and were better than expected. This was the first quarter where we saw all of our major process industry verticals return to positive growth, including Oil & Gas, which grew low single digits versus the prior year, and grew high single digits sequentially.  Turning now to Slide 6, and our Q3 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales grew by 29% versus the prior year, with strong double-digit growth across all three industry segments. EMEA sales increased 21%, driven by strength in Food & Beverage and Tire. Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 23%, with broad-based growth led by Semiconductor, Life Sciences, and Tire. In China, we saw double-digit growth driven by strength in Tire, Life Sciences and EV. We continue to expect growth in China will exceed the company average for the year, as our longer cycle businesses kick in. Latin America growth of 26% was led by Food & Beverage and Automotive.  Let's now turn to Slide 7 to review highlights for the full-year outlook. Orders momentum and backlog are expected to drive strong sales growth in the balance of the year and into fiscal 2022. Our higher top line guidance is driven by improvements in our Hybrid and Process industry segments. Our new outlook for total reported sales growth is up 12%, including 8% organic growth versus the prior year. We are seeing strong growth in both Core automation as well as Information Solutions and Connected Services. Acquisitions are contributing over a point of profitable growth. We are increasing our margin expectation to 20%. Our new adjusted EPS target of $9.20 at the midpoint of the range represents 17% growth compared to the prior year. This also includes $0.15 from transaction fees related to our pending acquisition of Plex. I should add that we expect double-digit Annual Recurring Revenue growth in fiscal 2021, with the Plex acquisition expected to add over $175 million to our ARR totals next fiscal year.  A more detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 8. I won't go into the details on this slide, but as you can see, we continue to expect broad-based organic sales growth this year. With that, let me now turn it over to Nick who will elaborate on our third quarter performance and updated financial outlook for fiscal 2021. Nick? Thanks, Nick. Once again, strong order trends and record backlog underpin a robust top line outlook, and we have confidence in our team's ability to navigate the supply chain challenges. And we continue to invest in our future. The combination of our software portfolio with our controllers, Intelligent Devices, and Lifecycle Services creates unique value for customers across Discrete, Hybrid, and Process end markets. Our momentum would not be possible without the tremendous efforts of our employees. I'd like to thank everyone at Rockwell, and particularly the people in our Integrated Supply Chain organization, who have done a great job managing pandemic challenges and now mitigating our sourcing constraints. We're leveraging our own manufacturing expertise to help customers be more resilient, agile, and sustainable. Let me now pass the baton back to Jessica and we'll begin the Q&A session. Hey Julian, first, just to around out 2021 as far as operating leverage, and we often at Rockwell talk about our core conversion, we see full year 2021 being right in the range of the 30% to 35% core conversion that we often talk about. As far as thinking about the future, of course, we'll say more about that in November at our Investor Day. But like one way to think about it is, there's several things, nothing drives our operating margin like top line growth, and given our 30% to 35% core conversion, we think that's still a helpful way to think about it. And that implies that we would expect our margins to expand next year. But of course, I'm going to give -- we will give more detail about that at our Investor Day in November. Sure. Well, Julian, we think that about two thirds of the capital projects that we're currently seeing in automotive have EV content. And EV power train is quickly passing the power train business we're seeing for internal combustion engines as a part of the mix within automotive. And we see that trend continuing and probably accelerating as new entrants into the EV market, either the established brand owners and then the startups are bringing their products to market. And our sales are, of course, directly to those brand owners, as well as all of the tier suppliers, like Wipro Power that we mentioned a little bit earlier. So around the world, we're very positive, very bullish on our portfolio. And quite frankly, we think Plex is going to help that with tier suppliers, because that's one of their strengths, providing their smart manufacturing platform to tier automotive suppliers. So we see this trend continuing. And we're expecting strength going into the next fiscal year in order. Thanks, Julian. Sure. For Rockwell, there's actually upside to an EV project versus a traditional internal combustion engine. So starting with the drive train, a lot of our independent cart technology wins for precision motion control have actually been on the battery and the drive train side, if you will, for EV where traditionally in internal combustion engines, Rockwell has had a smaller content. That may not be true for some of the other suppliers who have a traditional revenue stream for CNC or what have you, but we don't and so we're not losing business in that transition. It's a net positive for us.  On the software side, the EV manufacturers are adopting right from the start MES software as a necessary element of their production scheduling system. And so whereas 10 years ago or so, it was seen as a nice to have, but not necessarily a requirement with these new facilities coming online MES is seen as a necessary part of the bill of material, if you will. And then you combine all the other pieces of putting a vehicle together, that remained the same. So you still have to stamp and paint metal, you assemble the components, you test them at the end of the line, and so on. And those are all applications that Rockwell has good offerings for.  In terms of the competitive landscape, as you would expect, the usual suspects are there in terms of the traditional part of the vehicle manufacturing and assembly. On the battery and in the electric vehicle drive train, very heavy Asian content; China, Japan, Korea. And so I'd say it's even more international with a bias towards Asia in some of those new elements. And we've put together good teams for tracking and pursuing these projects that span across multiple countries. There's lots more applications within say, an Amazon fulfillment center that can be accomplished through independent cart. Today, those pieces of their overall facility are typically being provided by multiple of our customers. So you don't see necessarily one single sub supplier to them, providing all of the conveyance and sortation, and so on. And so we're working with some of the big ones, of course, whose names you would recognize. But there's also a whole host of integrators and machinery builders with a good idea, though, that Amazon is bringing into their ecosystem. And so we're working with a lot of these smaller suppliers. And I would also add, this isn't just for the big e-commerce giants. Now, this is for the big box retailers who are also looking to automate their material handling, the Walmarts of the world are also looking at these solutions at their individual locations, where they're bringing in tremendous amounts of material to try to get in the right place more efficiently than ever before. But we see almost limitless opportunity just in the e-commerce area for additional adoption of independent cart. And as we've talked about, we see independent cart wins in other applications outside of e-commerce. We see it in Life Sciences, we see it and Food and Beverage Packaging, given scalability and flexibility that manufacturers could never see before. And then we have some, let's say, more unusual applications, like the one we talked about with the U.S. Navy a few quarters ago. Thanks Scott. Hey Josh. Yeah, I would I would not look at this backlog as being longer-term shippable based on the mix of industries or projects. The longest backlog orders that we get are typically in solutions, and that's the part of the business that's actually getting a little bit slower to recover. So there's nothing in that mix that would indicate that these backlog increases are due to some, special case with respect to higher project content or what have you. It's really due to just the dramatic surge that we have seen and seen sustained over the last few quarter in orders, coupled with supply chain constraints. But we've given you the color about the individual verticals that it's coming from. And it's a great balance that, it has been across Discrete and Hybrid. And now, the process markets are starting to kick in a bit there. Hey Andy. Well, without saying too much about 2022 until November, we're very positive on where we are. The orders momentum, the backlog that we expect to largely shift as we get closer to normal levels through the balance of the year, our ability to compete and win in competitive projects across the world, and across the verticals. I think it's a great setup. And it should bode well for our growth and performance going into the next year and beyond. Yeah, we continue to see optimism for oil and gas as it always seems to do lagging the earlier cycle Discrete businesses. But we grew year-over-year and sequentially in oil and gas. We expect another quarter of growth in oil and gas in the fourth quarter. And while there's still a lot of uncertainty, these are projects around the world and we're continuing to watch COVID infections and those are continuing to be a concern for us. We think we're in a good spot with oil and gas and some of the comments from some of the earlier cycle oil and gas operators, the people who are providing drilling technology as well as oilfield services, those generally lead the impact on our business by say six or nine months. And so we are optimistic that some of the early signs that we saw this quarter in oil and gas are going to persist and pick up. Yeah, thank you. In terms of the tailwind for 2022, I mean, we're not yet in a position where we're sharing guidance on what we expect investment spend to be for 2022. But our total investment spend this year is going up approximately 2%, very much like our -- what we've seen in prior years. As far as headwinds and tailwind, I didn't quite catch all of that. But, for instance, it would be more likely that our bonus is back in a more normal zone of what I talked about during earlier on this call. That's an example. But I won't necessarily say investments will necessarily go down or not repeat. The one exception is we have temporary investments, these accelerated investments with $30 million, that is going exactly as we anticipated. That's $30 million in the second half of the year, about $10 million of that we spent in the third quarter of $20 million we're anticipating in the fourth quarter. Those will not repeat into 2022 and we did those investments to accelerate our growth in 2022. And then the last point is, as I said earlier with Julian's question, it's our expectation that margins will be expanding in fiscal year 2022. Well, obviously, we're seeing good sales rates that were above our expected expectations in Q3. And that led us to raise the guidance of organic growth at the midpoint for this year. And we expect that we'll be shifting the backlog through the balance of 2022 getting us closer towards, more normal backlog levels. Backlog will be up in Q4 a little bit, but not as market increase as we saw in Q3. Thank you. Good morning, Steve. Yeah, Steve we started the year with our planned compensation, which is what we would consider our normal amounts of $115 million. Given our expectation of exceeding that performance, we're currently expecting total bonus expense this year to be approximately $175 million. I think that's a pretty fair assumption. You know, in terms of the investments, yeah, the 30 million you should think of that is something that we're not planning to repeat. But we still haven't given our guidance here. We're working through a lot of things of how we want to, what we want to invest on in 2022. But yes, your assumption of taking 30 million out of what we've done this year, that's the way we've been saying that and I agree with that approach. I think the best way is to look to November when we're going to be able to provide more detail for this. Yeah, just so a couple of things. I'll start and Nick may have some additional comments. First of all, the figure in 2023 is after the adjusted adjustments for deferred revenue, that impact the revenue in 2021, and 2022. So you don't see the deferred revenue adjustment in 2023. So we're not looking for 30% top line growth in 2023. But we will not be seeing the deferred revenue adjustments carrying into that year. And then in terms of the mix of Plex's offering. So they offer a modular smart manufacturing platform, and it has ERP, it has MES, it has quality management, it has supply chain. And so particularly when you're talking to small and medium sized manufacturers, now they don't have big, centralized engineering resources to take a bunch of disparate software applications, and hope that they knit together. And so Plex offers an integrated suite of those modules. MES is a large portion of it, they have ERP and those other applications I mentioned, but they've done some good work over the last couple of years to modularize their offerings, so that a customer isn't forced to buy what they don't want. We will continue to support all these applications for the customers who've already bought them. And we're going to be helping Plex as they expand the introduction of the offering outside of the U.S., as well as to other industries, like food and beverage and pharmaceuticals, that they haven't had as much exposure to in the past. Sure, Noah, thanks for the question. Look, on the day that we announced it, I got a lot of unsolicited feedback from both employees and customers that I've developed relationships with over the years. And they were really excited, thrilled about what we were bringing in. They felt like it made great sense and it added what we can offer to compliment the core automation that they've been buying from us for years or in some cases, where they're trying to decide who their digital transformation partner is. With this, what we have, and this is something we've talked about for a long time, an approach that meets customers where they are on their journey. We're still going to sell a lot of on-premise software. And customers have made investments there and they want to see a migration path. And our MES orders have production center based MES continue to grow and those orders get larger, and we continue to see lots of runway for that software for customers who have decided they want an on-premise solution.  But we have the opportunity for customers who have made a decision that they're going to start working with these applications with cloud native software. And they're ready to start working there, to build on Plex's great customer base and introduce it to those customers who said, they're ready to look at that as well. And so having that approach, it all comes back to that theme of an open approach where we're not forcing one philosophy down a customer's throat. And we're telling them, we can meet them where they are on their journey. We'd like for that data to be coming from Rockwell core automation components but as we've talked about before, a lot of this software we fully expect is going to give us a way in into competitive strongholds where we're not currently the supplier of the core automation. And we're going to be providing the value at the software and then working on the automation pieces as well. So it's going to be a bold approach and we're thrilled about the new ways to win that Plex gives us. Sure. So in the quarter, we saw a little bit of an impact on supply chain in automotive, MRO. It was a small amount and we did not see that affecting capital projects or other industries. And we still believe that while this is something that our customers, operations, and supply chain organizations are going to continue to be working on for the foreseeable future, it's not going to crimp the supply going forward. And in fact, it's probably lessening with respect to automotive from what we may have seen earlier in the year. The part of the supply chain constraints that we're thinking about are in terms of converting our own backlog. And I've mentioned specifically that our supply chain organization, I think, is doing a terrific job navigating this, but it's not going to be over in the next quarter. We're going to continue to be dealing with these supply chain constraints for the foreseeable future and we're looking at how do we deal with these on a short term basis, but also on a longer term basis. And I would say electronic components are a piece of that. Some of this is, just simply brought on by the extremely sharp recovery in demand that we've seen, and that we continue to see in orders. But then there's also the labor and we have to make sure that we're a great destination for labor, in our plants, in our supply chain organization, in our development teams and so on across the organization. Because as you know, it's a very hard, it's a very active labor market right now. Again, I think we're doing a great job with that. We have really good collaboration across all parts of the organization to make sure that we're pulling together so that when people are considering Rockwell as a destination, that we come out on top. So it's those two areas, I would say, but again, in terms of the demand, we're really not seeing a significant dampening of demand brought on by our customers supply chain constraints. Yeah. Thanks, Noah."

So, with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake.\nBlake Moret: Thanks Jessica. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Slide three. Strong orders momentum we saw last quarter accelerated and broadened across verticals in fiscal Q2 surpassed $2 billion, which is a new record. Organic orders grew double-digits from last year's orders. As you may recall, COVID did not significantly impact our business until the June quarter of last year. Total reported sales grew 6%, including a two-point contribution from recent acquisitions, including Awesome, Kalypso and Fiix. Organic sales grew a little over 1% versus prior year, despite significant supply chain constraints. Manufacturing supply chain continues to be stressed by sharply increased demand, along with various well public-sized defense surrounding the world and have reduced output and narrowed freight lanes. We'll continue to navigate these challenges in the coming months, take measures to continue increasing supply chain resiliency. I'll now comment on our topline performance by business segment. Intelligent Devices organic sales increased 6%, led by strong broad-based demand for our automation products. Our motion control offering continues to shine up double-digits. CPG companies continue to add packaging flexibility. Software & Control organic sales also grew 6%, led by strong demand across this segment. We saw growth in Logix control, visualization, hardware and software, network and security infrastructure across the balance of our FactoryTalk software portfolio. Net sales growth over 12% for the segment in the quarter. Orders for the Intelligent Devices and Software & Control business segments totaled strong double-digits year-over-year and sequentially. Turning to Lifecycle Services, organic sales declined 11% versus the prior year, primarily impacted by weaker performance in oil and gas. On a sequential basis, revenue and orders grew mid-single-digits; expect continued sequential sales improvement in this segment -- balance of the year. Information Solutions & Connected Services had another strong quarter. Organic sales and orders were double-digits contribution across a variety of end markets. This quarter's orders also included a number of meaningful software and infrastructure-as-a-service, multiyear wins for some of the world's largest food and beverage manufacturers. This included Kraft heinz, where we actively monitor our industrial network and cybersecurity environments. These wins also contribute to ARR, which grew double-digits year-over-year. Total backlog grew strong double-digits on an organic basis, both year-over-year and sequentially. Turning to profitability. Segment operating margin of 22% and adjusted EPS of $2.41 were above expectations and overcame headwinds from the reinstatement of the bonus and higher costs related to supply chain constraints. Stronger volume, favorable business mix, timing of spending, all contributed to our strong profit performance in the quarter as we continue to increase our business resiliency. Let's now turn to slide 4, where I'll provide a few highlights of our Q2 end market performance. Figures are for organic sales. We had a very good growth from discrete industry segment, high single-digit sales growth significantly above our expectations. Within this industry segment, automotive sales were in line with expectations. Declining mid single-digits versus a strong prior year period when auto grew by over 20%. We continue to estimate 10% organic sales growth for the year in this vertical, as MRO continues to grow and as an increasing number of capital projects are expected to launch in the second half of the year. Despite chip shortages impacting automotive production, we are not seeing related delays in capital or operational spending for our products. The semiconductor vertical significantly outperformed our expectations this quarter, growing about 15%. We believe strong secular tailwinds, increasing capital spend, broadening share of wallet with customers are all driving our growth and share gains in this vertical. As a result, we are raising our semiconductor growth outlook, approximately 15% for the year, up from our original November guidance of mid single-digit growth. Another highlight within discrete was our performance in e-commerce with sales growing over 70% versus prior year. Once again, our differentiated offering, featuring our independent Cart Technology is enabling e-commerce applications at a growing number of marquee accounts. This vertical has significant secular tailwinds, of course, and has become a bigger growth driver for our overall discrete industry segment. Turning now to our hybrid industry segment. These verticals also had a terrific quarter. Food and beverage grew over 10% as our strong product portfolio enables these customers to efficiently add SKUs as they seek to differentiate their offering and maximize their growth. We saw increased capital spending by food and beverage customers in the quarter. Not surprisingly, packaging OEMs are also very busy. They contributed another quarter of double-digit growth versus the prior year. Life Sciences grew about 15% in Q2, led by strong demand in North America and Asia Pacific. We won an important MES project via during the quarter, opened the dawn AST pharmaceutical company, face the challenge of exporting products that need to comply with FDA regulations. Dawn AST is expecting production efficiency and quality to improve by going paperless through their choice of Rockwell's PharmaSuite MES. Based on the broad-based increase in life sciences demand, the share gains we are seeing in this market. We're raising our view on life sciences and expected to grow about 20% in fiscal 2021. Process markets were down approximately 10% and were weaker than expected, led by larger declines in oil and gas. Process verticals typically lag our discrete business by about half a year. That said, we saw sequential improvement, again, in North America for oil and gas during Q2. Finding customers are also becoming more active. We saw low single-digit growth in the quarter. Turning now to slide 5 and our Q2 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales grew by 2% versus the prior year, primarily due to strong growth in food and beverage, e-Commerce and Life Sciences. EMEA sales declined 7%, driven by Oil & Gas, metals and auto, partially offset by strength in Food & Beverage. Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 16%, broad-based growth led by semiconductor, chemicals and Life Sciences. Asia Pacific backlog reached another record high in the quarter. We expect strong sales growth in the region, both the upcoming quarter and full year. In China, we saw over 30% organic growth, driven by strong growth in all three industry segments, including particular strength in EV and semiconductor in discrete, tire, Life Sciences and Food & Beverage and hybrid, mining and chemical and process. We expect growth in China will exceed the company average for the year as our longer cycle businesses kick in. Let's now turn to Slide 6. Highlights for the full year outlook. Orders momentum in the first half of the year expected to drive strong sales growth in the balance of the year, especially as we enter a period of easier comps. Higher top line guidance is driven by improvements during the quarter, our discrete and hybrid industry segments that more than offset incremental declines in process. Our new outlook for total reported sales is over 10% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, including 7% organic growth. Core automation is not the only driver of growth this year, as we also expect double-digit sales growth in Information Solutions & Connected Services. We're seeing good contribution from both organic and inorganic sources. We also expect double-digit ARR growth in fiscal 2021. We expect margins to stay relatively flat with last year, despite the reinstatement of our bonus and the incremental one-time investments we spoke about last quarter that will largely impact the second half. Our new adjusted EPS target, $9.15 at the midpoint of the range, represents over 16% growth compared to the prior year. More detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 7. I won't go into the details on this slide. But as you can see, we continue to expect broad-based organic sales growth this year with Oil & Gas lagging. Our diversification across higher growth end markets is one aspect of the increasing business resilience that we talked about during the Investor Day in November. With that, let me now turn it over to Nick, who will elaborate on our second quarter performance and updated financial outlook fiscal 2021. Nick?\nNick Gangestad: Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. Slide 8, second quarter reported sales were up 5.6% year-over-year. Organic sales were up 1.3%, slightly better than our expectations. Acquisitions contributed 1.9 points of growth and currency translation increased sales by 2.4 points. Segment's operating margin was 22%, flat compared to Q2 of last year. This represents strong underlying improvement considering a $60 million headwind from the year-on-year change in the bonus. Corporate and other expense of $30 million was $12 million higher than last year, primarily due to mark-to-market adjustments related to our deferred [Technical Difficulty]. Adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter was 16.7% [Technical Difficulty] last year's rate benefited from several larger discrete items. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $2.41, well above our expectations, cover year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge for Q2 on a later slide. [Technical Difficulty] March 31, $674 million remain available [Technical Difficulty] authorization. Slide nine, provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. The Intelligent Devices segment had organic sales growth of 5.8% in the quarter. Segment margin was 23.8%, 80 basis points higher than last year, mainly due to higher sales and lower spend, partially offset by the reinstatement of incentive compensation. As Blake highlighted earlier, we once again had strong orders performance in the quarter, particularly in our products businesses. Intelligent Devices orders grew approximately 20%, both year-over-year and sequentially. Software & Control segment's organic sales grew 5.6% in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed four points to growth. Segment margin was 29% [Technical Difficulty]. Margin benefit from higher sales was offset by the reinstatement of incentive compensation. Software and control orders also grew mid-teens, both year-over-year and sequentially. Organic sales of the LifeCycle Services segment declined 11% year-over-year, as the recovery in this segment continues at a slower pace than our products businesses. Acquisitions contributed [Technical Difficulty]. Operating margin for this segment declined 310 basis points to 9% versus 12.1% a year ago, primarily due to lower sales and the reinstatement of incentive compensation, partially offset by favorable mix and cost savings from actions taken in the prior year. Second quarter book-to-bill performance for the LifeCycle Services segment was 1.19. In the next slide 10 provides the adjusted EPS block from Q2 [Technical Difficulty]. Starting on the left, [Technical Difficulty] positive impact of approximately [Technical Difficulty]. Slide 11 product order trend, slide shows our average daily order trends for our products. [Technical Difficulty]. Order intake for product [Technical Difficulty]. Q2 product order levels grew year-on-year as well as sequentially, they're at an all-time high, particularly strong areas were in [Indiscernible], utilization and Logix. Orders for the life cycle services segment also improved in the quarter sequentially, deliver slower pace than our product order growth. The overall strong order performance resulted in record company backlog, growing over 30% year-over-year, double-digits sequentially. This takes us to slide 12, updated guidance. We are increasing our organic sales growth outlook by one point across the range. The new range is 5.5% to 8.5% with a midpoint of 7%. We expect currency translation to now contribute about 2% to growth. We still expect acquisitions to contribute 1.5%. In total, the midpoint of our reported sales guidance range is 10.5% or about $7 billion. We've also updated the adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $8.95 to $9.35. I'll review the bridge from the prior guidance midpoint to the new $9.15 midpoint on the next slide. Segment operating margin is expected to be approximately 19.5%. This is unchanged from prior guidance and primarily reflects strong Q2 margin performance and the higher sales guidance offset by higher supply chain costs, bonus expense and less favorable currency. As a reminder, second half includes higher spend as well as the incremental one-time software development and sustainability investments that we discussed on last quarter's call. The one-time investments will primarily affect Software & Control segment. Our adjusted effective tax rate is still expected to be about 14%, the same as prior guidance. As previously mentioned, this includes a 300 basis point benefit related to discrete items, which we expect to realize late in the fiscal year. We continue to project free cash flow conversion to be approximately 100% of adjusted income. A few additional comments on fiscal 2021 guidance. Corporate and other expense is expected to be about $110 million. Total purchase accounting amortization expense for the full year is expected to be about $50 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2021 is still expected to be between $90 million and $95 million. And finally, we're still assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 117 million shares. This takes us to slide 13. This slide bridges the midpoint of our January adjusted EPS guidance range to the midpoint of our new guidance. Starting on the left. There's a higher contribution from core operating performance, primarily due to the higher organic sales guidance and favorable mix, partially offset by higher supply chain costs. Contribution from currency is now expected to be $0.10 lower compared to prior guidance. Next, given the increase in guidance, there's about a $0.15 impact from higher bonus expense, which brings the new midpoint of the guidance range to $9.15. Finally, a quick comment regarding the second half, we expect second half year-over-year organic sales growth of about 20%. With that, I'll hand it back to Blake for some additional comments.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Nick. With a solid first half under our belt, look at the remainder of fiscal 2021 with optimism, strong order trends and record backlog underpin a robust top-line outlook. We have confidence in our team's ability to navigate the supply chain challenges. Looking to our future. We continue to invest in software capabilities, including development, sales resources and infrastructure. These investments support strong growth in our software business and ARR fiscal 2022 and beyond. Our momentum would not be possible without the tremendous efforts of our employees. I'd like to thank everyone at Rockwell, and particularly, our integrated supply chain organization, which has done a great job managing pandemic challenges and now mitigating our sourcing and logistics constraints. We're leveraging our own manufacturing expertise to help customers be more resilient, agile and sustainable. Nobody is better positioned to help our customers deal with these increasingly complex manufacturing challenges and opportunities than Rockwell, and our ecosystem of best-in-class partners. With that, let me make some remarks about Steve Etzel, who is participating in his final earnings call. Steve stepped up during a critical period for us as we pivoted into the early stages of this recovery and accelerated our transformation. An experienced, dedication, hearing for fellow employees is exactly what we needed. Nick and I joined thousands of employees in wishing Steve and Michelle all the best, happy retirement, little adventure time. I now pass the baton back to Jessica to begin the Q&A session.\nJessica Kourakos: Thanks, Blake. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and the quick follow-up. And for those of you that had some trouble hearing us on the call, we'll make sure to have the prepared remarks available on our Investor Relations website immediately after the call. With that, let me pass it on to Tanya to start the Q&A. Tanya?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Scott Davis with Melius.\nScott Davis: Good morning, everybody.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning.\nScott Davis: And congrats, Steve on retirement. Good to hear your voice, Nick. Anyways, I -- like this is about the most excited I've heard you on an earnings call in a while. What -- when you think about these big new giant semi projects that have been announced, when do you start submitting RFPs for those? And do you envision that being, kind of, 2022 or 2023 business? I assume none of that is in the new projects are in your increase in forecast in 2021?\nBlake Moret: Scott, we are seeing some increased business in semi. I don't know that it's going into the US fabs that have been announced. But with some of these customers, we're already seeing some significant orders, which contributed to semi helping to power the growth in Asia. So it's not just the big fabs going into the US, its activity in other parts of the world, and we're starting to see that now. As far as the US fabs go, I think you're right. I think that's more of a story for next year and beyond. But everybody in that industry is making investments, and we're working hard to maximize our share of wallet at each of those customers.\nScott Davis: Good. And just a quick follow-up. On the incentive comp, is that -- is the run rate guide for 2Q, what we should expect in each of the quarters this year?\nNick Gangestad: So Scott, the run rate that we've been at for the first half is what we should expect for the second half as well. It's a little higher in the actual run rate in the second quarter. Because there's a little bit of catch-up given our added performance, but the run rate we're out through the first half is exactly what we expect to have in the second half.\nScott Davis: Okay. Thank you. Good luck, guys.\nNick Gangestad: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Your next question is from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: Yes. Good morning. Just a question, sort of, longer-term question. What kind of conversations are you having with your customers? We know that short-term things are getting better. You guys are excited about longer-term prospects for US CapEx. But are you starting to have these discussions with your customers about, sort of, longer run CapEx growth in North America?\nBlake Moret: Andrew, I do believe that this is the beginning of a sustained period of expansion in the North American manufacturing economy. The breadth of the orders that we're seeing, the mix of supply for existing operations plus expansions and then the occasional greenfield gives us a lot of confidence that we are seeing a sustained period of growth. And we're having those discussions across various industries. You look at EV, there's no chance of that slowing down. You look at semiconductor for the obvious reasons as they're increasing capacity, e-commerce with the secular tailwinds there; life sciences, food and beverage, the return of oil and gas. All of those are areas that we have significant exposure to. And we expect that, that's going to sustain for a period of time.\nAndrew Obin: And just a follow-up question. How do you adjust your own supply chain and manufacturing footprint to be able to service this, which seems to be a structural increase for a while?\nBlake Moret: Well, you look at increasing single points of failure in the supply chain, both on the part of our suppliers, as well as in our own internal operations. In some cases, that's done in supply. In other cases, it's redundant lines within our own operations. When it comes to areas where there's engineering required for specific projects, more work in terms of remote operations, to be able to go deeper in the commissioning process. Remotely, final acceptance testing, does it require the same degree of travel that it once did. And looking carefully at sizing our operations and inserting the agility, including our own automation to be able to maximize the number of different products that can come off a single line. So you look at the same kind of packaging flexibility that's driving the strong double-digit growth packaging to OEMs. We're incorporating a lot of those same concepts and our own operations, including our manufacturing, just down the hall from where we are right now in Milwaukee.\nAndrew Obin: Thank you.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: Your next question is from John Inch with Gordon Haskett.\nJohn Inch: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I'd like to start on taxes. Rockwell carries, I think, the lowest tax rate in multi-industry or very close to that. If items drive to raise U.S. corporate taxes exceeds, are there tax levers Rockwell can pull to offset, what would appear to be, possibly a disproportionately negative impact for your company?\nNick Gangestad: John, as far as levers we would pull, I mean it is still a little early to say exactly what we would be doing. But we continue to look at how we would best optimize our supply chain and servicing our customers and what that would mean for our -- ultimately for our taxes. But in terms of other levers, I think we're just waiting to see how this materializes. As far as the impact it will have, like we've shared in the past in our 10-K, the components that this -- of our current tax rate and certainly, a higher tax rate would impact us, but also components like FDII and GILTI. And those are the provisions we're really waiting to see more specifics of what it ends up looking like to really know how this will impact us in total, and whether there are any additional levers we can go after.\nJohn Inch: Well, Nick, based on your understanding of what's being proposed, because it's all there on the web, right? Rockwell's success in having lowered its tax rate, presumably through international -- your international operations and the way you're structured. Is any of that prospectively more at risk versus simply you being in the same boat and your U.S. taxes will rise along with everyone else. I don't think anyone's that concerned if Rockwell's U.S. taxes go up the same as everybody else's, because it is what it is. It's more to the question of the opportunity to maintain disproportionately lower tax rate based on your success of having achieved this, are there provisions that you understand that could be sort of tackling those areas? And can you do something about that type of thing?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. So, yes, you're exactly right, John. If there's an increase in the tax rate, that will impact us as I presume it will impact others fairly proportionately. What we see in what's been written that has an impact on what we have as an advantage in relatively low GILTI rate and some benefits from FDII. We're still waiting for any kind of information of theirs replacing FDII, if there's any incentives that are going to be put in place to be encouraging U.S. based manufacturing, which Rockwell does have a significant base of U.S. manufacturing. And then in the end, John, just making a bit broader macro changes to U.S. tax policy that ultimately do encourage more U.S. based manufacturing, that's ultimately benefiting our underlying business as well, given our strong presence that we have in the U.S.\nJohn Inch: Yes. No, I agree with that. Just then lastly, Nick, in the short time you've been at Rockwell, I'm wondering if you could talk about best practices or accomplishments you'd like to, say, bring over or see adopted based on your many years at 3M?\nNick Gangestad: Hey, John, thanks for that question. So let me just describe it this way. What am I seeing as priorities? And then what I'm observing in the company? First, from a priority standpoint, a high degree of priority in my early days here on execution. There's a lot of moving parts in the world and in this company and making sure that our company delivers from an execution perspective, that's a high priority. And then Rockwell has some very sound strategies about how to be continuing to increase our importance on our customers as the world of automation changes and industrial automation changes. And my focus is going to be how do we best realize those strategies and make those happen. Now, John, part of your question, just early observations, a great company. And one of the things I find very refreshing and positive, this is a company full of engineers. Engineers focused on productivity. And that kind of productivity enables opportunity for investment. So I find a very healthy balance here of what are we doing to drive productivity, but also how do we invested for future growth.\nJohn Inch: Got it. Thanks, Nick. Thanks, Blake.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Your next question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Just wanted to highlight maybe on the segment margin outlook. So it looks like in the second half, you're implying a segment margin down slightly year-on-year, despite the very high organic growth of 20%. So I understand what's going on with incentive comp, but maybe just on investment spend, remind us sort of the scale of that investment in the second half. If there's any specific weighting between the two quarters that are left? And whether there's any sort of carryover investment spend into next year as an increase?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. As far as the year-over-year margin, so comparing second half of 2020 to the second half of 2021. Those margins are going to -- as you just said, are going to be pretty similar. And some of the things that will be improving that margin year-over-year is the growth, which you just mentioned, some added price and also we'll be benefiting from some of the action -- structural actions that we've taken over the last 18 months. What will be depressing that or bringing that margin back down to year-on-year, more or less flat, is this bonus impact, which we've talked about, some rising input costs and then the investments that was, I think, really the heart of your question. And the investment spending that we're doing, and I'll put it in perspective for you. For the second quarter, our investment spending was down a couple of percentage points from the second quarter last year. For the full year, we expect them to be up 2.5 percentage points versus full year 2020. And those are coming from the investments that we've talked about with you already. Some of it the onetime accelerated software development expenses that we're funding, and that's going to be happening fairly evenly in the last two quarters of the year. But we're also investing in added growth platforms. That's been part of the plan. Some of that involves hiring and projects. And just as a little bit of color, we did see a $5 million to $10 million shift of spending from the -- that we intended to have in the second quarter, shifting into the second half of the year, primarily due to higher -- a bit higher -- bit delay in hiring as well as some project delays, not changing our overall spending plan but shifting a little of that in the second half of the year. So overall, we're expecting a noticeable uptick in investments in the second half of the year. As far as the run rate into next year, some of that will be trailing off. We've been very careful about some of these incremental investments, particularly the ones we talked about last quarter, that they will -- they are temporary one-time and will not be carrying forward into 2022. And all that into our second half EPS assumption, which more or less is unchanged from what we were saying a quarter ago.\nJulian Mitchell: Thank you, Nick. And maybe just a follow-up question around life cycle services trends. The sales were down, I think, low double-digit last quarter. But a book-to-bill of almost 1.2. So maybe characterize for us what kind of recovery slope we should see in LifeCycle Services from here?\nBlake Moret: Yes. Let me just make the general comment, and then Nick can add additional color. But LifeCycle Services' backlog is up year-over-year and sequentially. And so, we are expecting sequential improvements through Q3 and Q4.\nNick Gangestad: Yes. And -- Yes, as Blake just said, it will -- we continue to expect it to get better. We do expect for the full year, it will not be growing as fast as our other 2 segments.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thanks very much and I wish Steve all the best. Thank you.\nNick Gangestad: Thank you, Julian.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Just maybe 2 for me. First on supply disruptions, and I'm sorry if I missed it, you were cutting out a lot at the beginning. But can you just elaborate a little bit what you saw in the quarter, and we did pick up some things in our survey that suggested you were having some problems delivering PLCs and other things. Can you just give us a little bit of color on where your -- whether that's accurate, where you're at on kind of untangling that and was there any kind of discernible negative top line impact from supply disruptions either in the quarter or in your outlook for the back half?\nBlake Moret: Yes, Jeff, we factored supply chain constraints into our outlook. So there is an impact. And I think it's the things that you're hearing about throughout the industry that are affecting us like other manufacturers. So certainly, electronic components, including chips are in short supply, seeing other mechanical products and materials, sized strengths with resins that are used in a variety of manufacturing processes based on some of the bad weather, a little shorter-term than some of these other issues. Freight lanes continue to be narrow. And so seeing constricted building to transport products would be another area. We've done a nice job of having the necessary labor in [Technical Difficulty] so we really kept to an absolute minimum in our manufacturing operations, we still hire more. We've added several hundred people last quarter. And so that part is shared. But we're going to continue to be very dynamic situation based on sharply increased demand as well as others. And we're working with customers to minimize the disruption.\nJeff Sprague: Okay. And just on the investment spend, I understand there's some identifiable things you're doing that might be a little bit larger than the typical project. But it doesn't strike me that a 2.5% increase in investment spend for the year is unusual, but you're kind of suggesting it is as part of this margin construct. So perhaps, I have that wrong, but 2.5% growth in investment spend, I think, would be about $50 million, that kind of dovetails to the $0.35 you talked about in the back half on the software deals. Is there something else in that equation? Maybe you could just frame the kind of the normal trajectory of investment spend?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Jeff, I think the part of that, that I just want to make sure is clear is that, that increase in investment spend is all second half. In fact, more than all in the second half because year-on-year the first half, it was down. So just as we look sequentially first half to second half, we're seeing that sequentially going up, brings the full year to that $50 million that you're talking about of the year-on-year change, but more than all of that change is coming in the second half.\nJeff Sprague: Got it. Thank you. Understood.\nOperator: Your next question is from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, guys.\nBlake Moret: Hi, Andy.\nNick Gangestad: Hey, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Steve, congrats. Welcome, Nick. So you mentioned the big March order you had in your order trends, which makes two out of the last three quarters that you've called out larger orders. So given your focus, for instance, on independent card, which does tend to attract large orders, an increased focus on e-commerce. At what point are these larger orders more the rule than the exception? And then could you talk about the cadence of your Q2 orders ex the large order? In March, did you see a continued pickup in orders throughout the quarter?\nBlake Moret: Andy, let me start by saying, I hope you're right, and I hope seeing these large orders across different industries and different offerings becomes the rule rather than the exception. We are happy to see it. And the most recent one, as you said, was in e-commerce. We traditionally haven't called out in as much specificity the orders development from month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter. We thought during the pandemic, it made sense to give you that additional visibility. And it does show developing dynamic of having some of these large orders -- industries and in some cases, non-traditional offerings, so it gives us more ways to win. And so we're looking at that. We have seen a little bit of an uptick in large orders in general that began in Q2, and we would expect that to continue as our life cycle services segment kicks in, and that is where a fairly good proportion, our bigger traditional projects are home grown. So we do expect more of that to come. Majority of our business continues to be more run rate. We used to say $3 million to $5 million was a pretty big project for us. But now we're seeing an increasing frequency of bigger ones.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Blake, that's helpful. And then you hired several new leaders, including Nick, a few months ago. We know Scott and Brian have different roles, but both seem focused on improving and accelerating Rock software sales, annual recurring revenue. So maybe it's early days, but could you talk about the impact they're having so far on that side of the business? And we just focus on Software & Control. It obviously, has easy comparisons in the second half of your fiscal year, but it's already growing 12% in Q2. So is the expectation at this point that this segment could be a double-digit grower through maybe '22?\nBlake Moret: I won't comment specifically on '22, but I really like the idea that our highest margin segment is also fastest growing, so that's a nice place to be. I've been very happy with the new perspectives that our new execs have brought to the organization and the way that the organization has embraced them. That's not easy to do, is to bring people in at a senior position into a well-established company with a long culture, a strong culture. But I've been very happy with the way that we brought in those new perspectives into the organization. Brian is focused on increasing the frequency and the impact of new product introductions, particularly around software. Scott's focused on doing the things to focus our sales force on delivering outcomes to customers and increasing our annual recurring revenue, great experience that he brings and high credibility as he works with our sales force. And obviously, as Nick said earlier, that the financial organization analyze the execution of this strategy are all good things.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Thanks, Blake.\nOperator: Your next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Hi. Good morning.\nBlake Moret: Hi, Steve. Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Thanks for all the details. The slide deck is very straightforward and a lot of very informative. So easy to digest. Thank you for that. Appreciate it. The $2 billion in orders, I think that's like the total absolute number for the quarter, correct? And I mean, that's a relatively -- obviously, a big number. How do you see that kind of playing out over the course of the next couple of quarters, given it's such a solid kind of book-to-bill, if you will?\nBlake Moret: Yes. Well -- and we wanted to call that out, because this is really before Lifecycle Services is kicking in full. So we're expecting a nice run of that magnitude of orders for the company over the next few quarters and this is primarily driven at this point with products. But again, as the project business ramps up, which is our expectation, that could deliver some continued nice results there.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And as far as this investment spend is concerned, just going back to Jeff's question. So I think you're saying that some of the uptick in investments this year goes away. But does that mean that number is actually down next year? Or it's just growing less off of the higher base next year? Because usually, you guys do have anywhere from, I don't know, a $45 million to $50 million to even $80 million year-over-year headwind, I mean, going back to like 2010 from kind of investments growing faster than sales. Is what -- can you just kind of refine the messaging on that account and where it goes next year?\nNick Gangestad: Sure. Thanks, Steve. I believe it's a little early to get anything too declarative on 2022. However, just to clarify, this increase in investment spend is approximately $30 million of that we are saying is temporary. The rest of it is part of our normal increase in investment spend. And then the other way to think about it, Steve, is we also expect a 30% to 35% potential the core conversion. And that's the way we've operated, and that's the way we continue to expect to operate.\nSteve Tusa: Right. And that 30% to 35% would be, again, like an all-in kind of number for the segments, including whatever happens with this investment bucket for next year? Correct?\nNick Gangestad: That's that. When we say that, 30% to 35%, that includes the investment spend. We, however, are holding ourselves to a higher bar and not giving ourselves that credit for that $30 million of incremental spend when we think about that core conversion next year.\nSteve Tusa: Yes. Okay. That makes sense. I appreciate the color. Thanks.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Your next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi. Good morning, guys.\nBlake Moret: Hey, Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: So Blake, I just want to talk about software for a minute and maybe what you're seeing out there. Are you running into competitors when you win some of these orders? Is it more of a non-competitive process where you're just sort of attaching on to an installed base? And then maybe talk about what product lines you're seeing strength, and I think Honeywell talked about cybersecurity. I know you have an offering there as well. So maybe just sort of a landscape of what you're seeing in the software side?\nBlake Moret: Sure. So parts of the software business are still somewhat fragmented where you're largely competing against doing nothing on the part of our customer or a homegrown solution. And we still see a lot of that within, say, IoT applications. In MES, it's a little bit more, let's say, mature. And you are typically competing with a fairly well-known competitor, sometimes our traditional full scope automation competitors, sometimes niche competitors. And that visualization, I would say, is similar to that, which is a big part of our software offering. Again, a little bit more stratified, but there's the new applications, IoT, analytics, things like that. It's still a fairly diffuse, let's say, competitor landscape customers are looking for the outcomes. And you're also having to dovetail into an installed base. That's a big part of it, because a lot of your challenges come in the interfaces with existing installations, and that's why we've taken that open approach to expect that these customers already have software and hardware in place and don't want to rip it all out. With respect to cybersecurity, even apart from the hardware, we got a cybersecurity business that's over $100 million in terms of the services. It grew double digits, very strong. We're seeing good contribution from recent acquisitions of Avnet and Oilo, and that's an area that I'm particularly proud of, because it's an area that when we introduced it, it wasn't one that customers necessarily thought of Rockwell first for. But we're having a great impact on customers, and we're working with a whole new set of decision-makers, including the CIO and his or her team in some really big companies, so very happy with the development of that part of our business.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up question on orders. Maybe taking a step back, I get that that $2 billion of orders really only covers about two-thirds of the business. And some of that's longer cycle. But cyclically, seasonally, I don't know if you necessarily go backwards from here. Does that suggest that Rockwell is an $8 billion company over the next couple of years? Like why wouldn't the $2 billion get multiplied by something near four, and you have a bit of a fudge factor for Lifecycle Services, like what leaks out of that equation, because it seems like a pretty big number pretty early in the cycle?\nBlake Moret: Well, we're happy with it. That's why we've called it down. I want to make sure and you know this, Josh that the $2 billion is a company number, but we're notching that figure even before Lifecycle Services really kicks in like we expected to over the next couple of quarters. But yes, we're expecting that as we've created more ways to win, our strategy is to accelerate profitable growth. That's what we've been talking about in the last two years, doing it by growing as a higher multiple of industrial production in our core, continued double digits in Information Solutions and Connected Services and making acquisitions that are going to, again, give us more ways to win.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hey, perfect. Thanks for that.\nBlake Moret: Thanks Josh.\nOperator: Your next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. Nick is going to hear new voice, we couldn\u2019t hear that well, and Steve congratulations on your retirement. I hate to go back over investor spend again, but I'm a little bit bamboozle about some of new pieces here. But when you talk about the increase in the full year, 2.5% mentioned, $50 million you okay with. Is that the second half increase, or is that $50 million for the full year and the second half is more than to that number? Just want to clarify that, please.\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Nigel, happy to clarify that. We were down in investment spend in the first half of the year. We were down approximately between $40 million and $50 million. We now expect the full year to be up approximately $50 million or $55 million that means the delta of $90 million to $100 million higher investment spend in the second half standalone.\nNigel Coe: Okay. That's clear. And then of that $90 million to $100 million, about $30 million is temporary and washes away, is that correct?\nNick Gangestad: Exactly.\nNigel Coe: Okay, got it. Okay. Clear as crystal. And then moving on to semi, I know it's a relatively small portion of your revenues. But, obviously, everyone very excited about the investment spend that we are seeing committed in the U.S. Can you just remind us where do you currently play? Where does Rockwell currently play in the fab? And what opportunities do you see to maybe increase the scope going forward?\nBlake Moret: Sure. Nigel, the primary applications are around facilities management. So it's making sure that the environment is clean and not the right temperature and the right humidity and so on. It's a fairly complex automation project, and that's our traditional area. Lately, we've had some success in increasing the scope even within that facilities management, including things like cybersecurity and other related services and networking. We see additional opportunity in the materials handling. And also, given that we are a good-sized user of electronic components and use circuit boards and so on. We've developed some artificial intelligence applications that have helped us be more productive, and we're working with some customers to acquaint them with our capabilities there as well. So, there's a lot of additional room expansion from that base.\nNigel Coe: Thanks, Blake. It\u2019s very helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Your final question is from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.\nNoah Kaye: Good morning and thanks. You commented earlier about the process of continuing to increase your importance to the customers. And Blake, some of the supply issues you've cited on this call around freight, narrowing and trip shortage and just materials availability in general. I mean, obviously a huge portion of your customer base is all going through that at the same time. And so, I was curious, if you can talk to us a little bit about, how you're seeing the customers use some of your software offerings like FactoryTalk and others to deal with these supply chain issues and how that is advancing your dialogue with them and your opportunity set?\nBlake Moret: One of the ways, just for an example looking at our own MES software, when we added that into our operations over the last decade there were a couple of ways that, that increased our efficiency. It decreased work in process, and it also helped us with airproofing, to be able to have a defined workflow, so as our customers are having to bring new talent on that may be new to these types of operations, that workforce development is a big deal. And it sometimes sits right on the critical path of getting new capacity up and running. So whether it's the MES software that we've been offering, augmented reality offerings that we have with PTC. We've got some great solutions as well as the training that we provide to help with these new hires at our customers come online just as fast as possible. I also believe that the flexibility that we are adding in our own operations, and I mentioned earlier, in our own contactor facility here in Milwaukee, is giving us insight that we can impart to our customers to help them be more agile, to produce a wider variety of SKUs on a single line. I saw an application recently with a beverage company that's able to make a very wide range of packaging formats for beverages, using our independent cart technology. And it's a whole different game than it was 10 years ago in terms of different types of SKUs that these companies can create to maximize their shelf space and retail outlets.\nNoah Kaye: Yes. And you mentioned, MES being able to reduce work in progress. But we're hearing about, for example, in auto suppliers trying to reach two and three layers deeper into their supply chain and trying to, through software, do better tracking, not walking away from just in time, but really trying to evolve and get a better visualization of the entire supply base. Is that something that Rockwell can play a role in and then how also?\nBlake Moret: Yes, absolutely. Being able to take those real-time production signals and to be able to look upstream into that supply base, and just as you said, going deeper and before, it's not a nice to have anymore, it's a requirement to be able to look at those suppliers and to be able to marry that with your real-time production requirements, particularly when you're looking at increasingly multiple potential sources of supply for those components or those materials that you need. So, we see a lot of activity going forward. And you talk customers, nothing gets them more interested in when you talk about the role that we can play in a connected supply chain. There's huge amounts of additional productivity that we can help with their and our ecosystem. Because that's an area that ecosystem is going to play a very large role.\nNoah Kaye: Make sense. Thanks so much.\nBlake Moret: Yes. Thanks, Noah.\nJessica Kourakos: Operator, now I'll turn it back to Blake for a few final comments.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Jessica. In summary, we're very pleased with our strong performance in the quarter. The recovery in manufacturing is accelerating at a much faster pace than we initially expected. Rockwell is extremely well positioned in this recovery, and we're especially excited about the new product introductions and services that we will bring to market over the next couple of years. It's an exciting time to be a part of the Rockwell journey. We thank you for your interest and ongoing support.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. At this time, you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. Slide 8, second quarter reported sales were up 5.6% year-over-year. Organic sales were up 1.3%, slightly better than our expectations. Acquisitions contributed 1.9 points of growth and currency translation increased sales by 2.4 points. Segment's operating margin was 22%, flat compared to Q2 of last year. This represents strong underlying improvement considering a $60 million headwind from the year-on-year change in the bonus. Corporate and other expense of $30 million was $12 million higher than last year, primarily due to mark-to-market adjustments related to our deferred [Technical Difficulty]. Adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter was 16.7% [Technical Difficulty] last year's rate benefited from several larger discrete items. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $2.41, well above our expectations, cover year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge for Q2 on a later slide. [Technical Difficulty] March 31, $674 million remain available [Technical Difficulty] authorization. Slide nine, provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. The Intelligent Devices segment had organic sales growth of 5.8% in the quarter. Segment margin was 23.8%, 80 basis points higher than last year, mainly due to higher sales and lower spend, partially offset by the reinstatement of incentive compensation. As Blake highlighted earlier, we once again had strong orders performance in the quarter, particularly in our products businesses. Intelligent Devices orders grew approximately 20%, both year-over-year and sequentially. Software & Control segment's organic sales grew 5.6% in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed four points to growth. Segment margin was 29% [Technical Difficulty]. Margin benefit from higher sales was offset by the reinstatement of incentive compensation. Software and control orders also grew mid-teens, both year-over-year and sequentially. Organic sales of the LifeCycle Services segment declined 11% year-over-year, as the recovery in this segment continues at a slower pace than our products businesses. Acquisitions contributed [Technical Difficulty]. Operating margin for this segment declined 310 basis points to 9% versus 12.1% a year ago, primarily due to lower sales and the reinstatement of incentive compensation, partially offset by favorable mix and cost savings from actions taken in the prior year. Second quarter book-to-bill performance for the LifeCycle Services segment was 1.19. In the next slide 10 provides the adjusted EPS block from Q2 [Technical Difficulty]. Starting on the left, [Technical Difficulty] positive impact of approximately [Technical Difficulty]. Slide 11 product order trend, slide shows our average daily order trends for our products. [Technical Difficulty]. Order intake for product [Technical Difficulty]. Q2 product order levels grew year-on-year as well as sequentially, they're at an all-time high, particularly strong areas were in [Indiscernible], utilization and Logix. Orders for the life cycle services segment also improved in the quarter sequentially, deliver slower pace than our product order growth. The overall strong order performance resulted in record company backlog, growing over 30% year-over-year, double-digits sequentially. This takes us to slide 12, updated guidance. We are increasing our organic sales growth outlook by one point across the range. The new range is 5.5% to 8.5% with a midpoint of 7%. We expect currency translation to now contribute about 2% to growth. We still expect acquisitions to contribute 1.5%. In total, the midpoint of our reported sales guidance range is 10.5% or about $7 billion. We've also updated the adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $8.95 to $9.35. I'll review the bridge from the prior guidance midpoint to the new $9.15 midpoint on the next slide. Segment operating margin is expected to be approximately 19.5%. This is unchanged from prior guidance and primarily reflects strong Q2 margin performance and the higher sales guidance offset by higher supply chain costs, bonus expense and less favorable currency. As a reminder, second half includes higher spend as well as the incremental one-time software development and sustainability investments that we discussed on last quarter's call. The one-time investments will primarily affect Software & Control segment. Our adjusted effective tax rate is still expected to be about 14%, the same as prior guidance. As previously mentioned, this includes a 300 basis point benefit related to discrete items, which we expect to realize late in the fiscal year. We continue to project free cash flow conversion to be approximately 100% of adjusted income. A few additional comments on fiscal 2021 guidance. Corporate and other expense is expected to be about $110 million. Total purchase accounting amortization expense for the full year is expected to be about $50 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2021 is still expected to be between $90 million and $95 million. And finally, we're still assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 117 million shares. This takes us to slide 13. This slide bridges the midpoint of our January adjusted EPS guidance range to the midpoint of our new guidance. Starting on the left. There's a higher contribution from core operating performance, primarily due to the higher organic sales guidance and favorable mix, partially offset by higher supply chain costs. Contribution from currency is now expected to be $0.10 lower compared to prior guidance. Next, given the increase in guidance, there's about a $0.15 impact from higher bonus expense, which brings the new midpoint of the guidance range to $9.15. Finally, a quick comment regarding the second half, we expect second half year-over-year organic sales growth of about 20%. With that, I'll hand it back to Blake for some additional comments. Good morning. So Scott, the run rate that we've been at for the first half is what we should expect for the second half as well. It's a little higher in the actual run rate in the second quarter. Because there's a little bit of catch-up given our added performance, but the run rate we're out through the first half is exactly what we expect to have in the second half. Thanks, Scott. John, as far as levers we would pull, I mean it is still a little early to say exactly what we would be doing. But we continue to look at how we would best optimize our supply chain and servicing our customers and what that would mean for our -- ultimately for our taxes. But in terms of other levers, I think we're just waiting to see how this materializes. As far as the impact it will have, like we've shared in the past in our 10-K, the components that this -- of our current tax rate and certainly, a higher tax rate would impact us, but also components like FDII and GILTI. And those are the provisions we're really waiting to see more specifics of what it ends up looking like to really know how this will impact us in total, and whether there are any additional levers we can go after. Yes. So, yes, you're exactly right, John. If there's an increase in the tax rate, that will impact us as I presume it will impact others fairly proportionately. What we see in what's been written that has an impact on what we have as an advantage in relatively low GILTI rate and some benefits from FDII. We're still waiting for any kind of information of theirs replacing FDII, if there's any incentives that are going to be put in place to be encouraging U.S. based manufacturing, which Rockwell does have a significant base of U.S. manufacturing. And then in the end, John, just making a bit broader macro changes to U.S. tax policy that ultimately do encourage more U.S. based manufacturing, that's ultimately benefiting our underlying business as well, given our strong presence that we have in the U.S. Hey, John, thanks for that question. So let me just describe it this way. What am I seeing as priorities? And then what I'm observing in the company? First, from a priority standpoint, a high degree of priority in my early days here on execution. There's a lot of moving parts in the world and in this company and making sure that our company delivers from an execution perspective, that's a high priority. And then Rockwell has some very sound strategies about how to be continuing to increase our importance on our customers as the world of automation changes and industrial automation changes. And my focus is going to be how do we best realize those strategies and make those happen. Now, John, part of your question, just early observations, a great company. And one of the things I find very refreshing and positive, this is a company full of engineers. Engineers focused on productivity. And that kind of productivity enables opportunity for investment. So I find a very healthy balance here of what are we doing to drive productivity, but also how do we invested for future growth. Yes. As far as the year-over-year margin, so comparing second half of 2020 to the second half of 2021. Those margins are going to -- as you just said, are going to be pretty similar. And some of the things that will be improving that margin year-over-year is the growth, which you just mentioned, some added price and also we'll be benefiting from some of the action -- structural actions that we've taken over the last 18 months. What will be depressing that or bringing that margin back down to year-on-year, more or less flat, is this bonus impact, which we've talked about, some rising input costs and then the investments that was, I think, really the heart of your question. And the investment spending that we're doing, and I'll put it in perspective for you. For the second quarter, our investment spending was down a couple of percentage points from the second quarter last year. For the full year, we expect them to be up 2.5 percentage points versus full year 2020. And those are coming from the investments that we've talked about with you already. Some of it the onetime accelerated software development expenses that we're funding, and that's going to be happening fairly evenly in the last two quarters of the year. But we're also investing in added growth platforms. That's been part of the plan. Some of that involves hiring and projects. And just as a little bit of color, we did see a $5 million to $10 million shift of spending from the -- that we intended to have in the second quarter, shifting into the second half of the year, primarily due to higher -- a bit higher -- bit delay in hiring as well as some project delays, not changing our overall spending plan but shifting a little of that in the second half of the year. So overall, we're expecting a noticeable uptick in investments in the second half of the year. As far as the run rate into next year, some of that will be trailing off. We've been very careful about some of these incremental investments, particularly the ones we talked about last quarter, that they will -- they are temporary one-time and will not be carrying forward into 2022. And all that into our second half EPS assumption, which more or less is unchanged from what we were saying a quarter ago. Yes. And -- Yes, as Blake just said, it will -- we continue to expect it to get better. We do expect for the full year, it will not be growing as fast as our other 2 segments. Thank you, Julian. Yes, Jeff, I think the part of that, that I just want to make sure is clear is that, that increase in investment spend is all second half. In fact, more than all in the second half because year-on-year the first half, it was down. So just as we look sequentially first half to second half, we're seeing that sequentially going up, brings the full year to that $50 million that you're talking about of the year-on-year change, but more than all of that change is coming in the second half. Hey, Andy. Sure. Thanks, Steve. I believe it's a little early to get anything too declarative on 2022. However, just to clarify, this increase in investment spend is approximately $30 million of that we are saying is temporary. The rest of it is part of our normal increase in investment spend. And then the other way to think about it, Steve, is we also expect a 30% to 35% potential the core conversion. And that's the way we've operated, and that's the way we continue to expect to operate. That's that. When we say that, 30% to 35%, that includes the investment spend. We, however, are holding ourselves to a higher bar and not giving ourselves that credit for that $30 million of incremental spend when we think about that core conversion next year. Yes, Nigel, happy to clarify that. We were down in investment spend in the first half of the year. We were down approximately between $40 million and $50 million. We now expect the full year to be up approximately $50 million or $55 million that means the delta of $90 million to $100 million higher investment spend in the second half standalone. Exactly."

            "name": "Blake Moret",
            "content": "Thanks Jessica. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Slide three. Strong orders momentum we saw last quarter accelerated and broadened across verticals in fiscal Q2 surpassed $2 billion, which is a new record. Organic orders grew double-digits from last year's orders. As you may recall, COVID did not significantly impact our business until the June quarter of last year. Total reported sales grew 6%, including a two-point contribution from recent acquisitions, including Awesome, Kalypso and Fiix. Organic sales grew a little over 1% versus prior year, despite significant supply chain constraints. Manufacturing supply chain continues to be stressed by sharply increased demand, along with various well public-sized defense surrounding the world and have reduced output and narrowed freight lanes. We'll continue to navigate these challenges in the coming months, take measures to continue increasing supply chain resiliency. I'll now comment on our topline performance by business segment. Intelligent Devices organic sales increased 6%, led by strong broad-based demand for our automation products. Our motion control offering continues to shine up double-digits. CPG companies continue to add packaging flexibility. Software & Control organic sales also grew 6%, led by strong demand across this segment. We saw growth in Logix control, visualization, hardware and software, network and security infrastructure across the balance of our FactoryTalk software portfolio. Net sales growth over 12% for the segment in the quarter. Orders for the Intelligent Devices and Software & Control business segments totaled strong double-digits year-over-year and sequentially. Turning to Lifecycle Services, organic sales declined 11% versus the prior year, primarily impacted by weaker performance in oil and gas. On a sequential basis, revenue and orders grew mid-single-digits; expect continued sequential sales improvement in this segment -- balance of the year. Information Solutions & Connected Services had another strong quarter. Organic sales and orders were double-digits contribution across a variety of end markets. This quarter's orders also included a number of meaningful software and infrastructure-as-a-service, multiyear wins for some of the world's largest food and beverage manufacturers. This included Kraft heinz, where we actively monitor our industrial network and cybersecurity environments. These wins also contribute to ARR, which grew double-digits year-over-year. Total backlog grew strong double-digits on an organic basis, both year-over-year and sequentially. Turning to profitability. Segment operating margin of 22% and adjusted EPS of $2.41 were above expectations and overcame headwinds from the reinstatement of the bonus and higher costs related to supply chain constraints. Stronger volume, favorable business mix, timing of spending, all contributed to our strong profit performance in the quarter as we continue to increase our business resiliency. Let's now turn to slide 4, where I'll provide a few highlights of our Q2 end market performance. Figures are for organic sales. We had a very good growth from discrete industry segment, high single-digit sales growth significantly above our expectations. Within this industry segment, automotive sales were in line with expectations. Declining mid single-digits versus a strong prior year period when auto grew by over 20%. We continue to estimate 10% organic sales growth for the year in this vertical, as MRO continues to grow and as an increasing number of capital projects are expected to launch in the second half of the year. Despite chip shortages impacting automotive production, we are not seeing related delays in capital or operational spending for our products. The semiconductor vertical significantly outperformed our expectations this quarter, growing about 15%. We believe strong secular tailwinds, increasing capital spend, broadening share of wallet with customers are all driving our growth and share gains in this vertical. As a result, we are raising our semiconductor growth outlook, approximately 15% for the year, up from our original November guidance of mid single-digit growth. Another highlight within discrete was our performance in e-commerce with sales growing over 70% versus prior year. Once again, our differentiated offering, featuring our independent Cart Technology is enabling e-commerce applications at a growing number of marquee accounts. This vertical has significant secular tailwinds, of course, and has become a bigger growth driver for our overall discrete industry segment. Turning now to our hybrid industry segment. These verticals also had a terrific quarter. Food and beverage grew over 10% as our strong product portfolio enables these customers to efficiently add SKUs as they seek to differentiate their offering and maximize their growth. We saw increased capital spending by food and beverage customers in the quarter. Not surprisingly, packaging OEMs are also very busy. They contributed another quarter of double-digit growth versus the prior year. Life Sciences grew about 15% in Q2, led by strong demand in North America and Asia Pacific. We won an important MES project via during the quarter, opened the dawn AST pharmaceutical company, face the challenge of exporting products that need to comply with FDA regulations. Dawn AST is expecting production efficiency and quality to improve by going paperless through their choice of Rockwell's PharmaSuite MES. Based on the broad-based increase in life sciences demand, the share gains we are seeing in this market. We're raising our view on life sciences and expected to grow about 20% in fiscal 2021. Process markets were down approximately 10% and were weaker than expected, led by larger declines in oil and gas. Process verticals typically lag our discrete business by about half a year. That said, we saw sequential improvement, again, in North America for oil and gas during Q2. Finding customers are also becoming more active. We saw low single-digit growth in the quarter. Turning now to slide 5 and our Q2 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales grew by 2% versus the prior year, primarily due to strong growth in food and beverage, e-Commerce and Life Sciences. EMEA sales declined 7%, driven by Oil & Gas, metals and auto, partially offset by strength in Food & Beverage. Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 16%, broad-based growth led by semiconductor, chemicals and Life Sciences. Asia Pacific backlog reached another record high in the quarter. We expect strong sales growth in the region, both the upcoming quarter and full year. In China, we saw over 30% organic growth, driven by strong growth in all three industry segments, including particular strength in EV and semiconductor in discrete, tire, Life Sciences and Food & Beverage and hybrid, mining and chemical and process. We expect growth in China will exceed the company average for the year as our longer cycle businesses kick in. Let's now turn to Slide 6. Highlights for the full year outlook. Orders momentum in the first half of the year expected to drive strong sales growth in the balance of the year, especially as we enter a period of easier comps. Higher top line guidance is driven by improvements during the quarter, our discrete and hybrid industry segments that more than offset incremental declines in process. Our new outlook for total reported sales is over 10% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, including 7% organic growth. Core automation is not the only driver of growth this year, as we also expect double-digit sales growth in Information Solutions & Connected Services. We're seeing good contribution from both organic and inorganic sources. We also expect double-digit ARR growth in fiscal 2021. We expect margins to stay relatively flat with last year, despite the reinstatement of our bonus and the incremental one-time investments we spoke about last quarter that will largely impact the second half. Our new adjusted EPS target, $9.15 at the midpoint of the range, represents over 16% growth compared to the prior year. More detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 7. I won't go into the details on this slide. But as you can see, we continue to expect broad-based organic sales growth this year with Oil & Gas lagging. Our diversification across higher growth end markets is one aspect of the increasing business resilience that we talked about during the Investor Day in November. With that, let me now turn it over to Nick, who will elaborate on our second quarter performance and updated financial outlook fiscal 2021. Nick? Thanks, Nick. With a solid first half under our belt, look at the remainder of fiscal 2021 with optimism, strong order trends and record backlog underpin a robust top-line outlook. We have confidence in our team's ability to navigate the supply chain challenges. Looking to our future. We continue to invest in software capabilities, including development, sales resources and infrastructure. These investments support strong growth in our software business and ARR fiscal 2022 and beyond. Our momentum would not be possible without the tremendous efforts of our employees. I'd like to thank everyone at Rockwell, and particularly, our integrated supply chain organization, which has done a great job managing pandemic challenges and now mitigating our sourcing and logistics constraints. We're leveraging our own manufacturing expertise to help customers be more resilient, agile and sustainable. Nobody is better positioned to help our customers deal with these increasingly complex manufacturing challenges and opportunities than Rockwell, and our ecosystem of best-in-class partners. With that, let me make some remarks about Steve Etzel, who is participating in his final earnings call. Steve stepped up during a critical period for us as we pivoted into the early stages of this recovery and accelerated our transformation. An experienced, dedication, hearing for fellow employees is exactly what we needed. Nick and I joined thousands of employees in wishing Steve and Michelle all the best, happy retirement, little adventure time. I now pass the baton back to Jessica to begin the Q&A session. Scott, we are seeing some increased business in semi. I don't know that it's going into the US fabs that have been announced. But with some of these customers, we're already seeing some significant orders, which contributed to semi helping to power the growth in Asia. So it's not just the big fabs going into the US, its activity in other parts of the world, and we're starting to see that now. As far as the US fabs go, I think you're right. I think that's more of a story for next year and beyond. But everybody in that industry is making investments, and we're working hard to maximize our share of wallet at each of those customers. Andrew, I do believe that this is the beginning of a sustained period of expansion in the North American manufacturing economy. The breadth of the orders that we're seeing, the mix of supply for existing operations plus expansions and then the occasional greenfield gives us a lot of confidence that we are seeing a sustained period of growth. And we're having those discussions across various industries. You look at EV, there's no chance of that slowing down. You look at semiconductor for the obvious reasons as they're increasing capacity, e-commerce with the secular tailwinds there; life sciences, food and beverage, the return of oil and gas. All of those are areas that we have significant exposure to. And we expect that, that's going to sustain for a period of time. Well, you look at increasing single points of failure in the supply chain, both on the part of our suppliers, as well as in our own internal operations. In some cases, that's done in supply. In other cases, it's redundant lines within our own operations. When it comes to areas where there's engineering required for specific projects, more work in terms of remote operations, to be able to go deeper in the commissioning process. Remotely, final acceptance testing, does it require the same degree of travel that it once did. And looking carefully at sizing our operations and inserting the agility, including our own automation to be able to maximize the number of different products that can come off a single line. So you look at the same kind of packaging flexibility that's driving the strong double-digit growth packaging to OEMs. We're incorporating a lot of those same concepts and our own operations, including our manufacturing, just down the hall from where we are right now in Milwaukee. Thanks, Andrew. Thanks, John. Yes. Let me just make the general comment, and then Nick can add additional color. But LifeCycle Services' backlog is up year-over-year and sequentially. And so, we are expecting sequential improvements through Q3 and Q4. Yes, Jeff, we factored supply chain constraints into our outlook. So there is an impact. And I think it's the things that you're hearing about throughout the industry that are affecting us like other manufacturers. So certainly, electronic components, including chips are in short supply, seeing other mechanical products and materials, sized strengths with resins that are used in a variety of manufacturing processes based on some of the bad weather, a little shorter-term than some of these other issues. Freight lanes continue to be narrow. And so seeing constricted building to transport products would be another area. We've done a nice job of having the necessary labor in [Technical Difficulty] so we really kept to an absolute minimum in our manufacturing operations, we still hire more. We've added several hundred people last quarter. And so that part is shared. But we're going to continue to be very dynamic situation based on sharply increased demand as well as others. And we're working with customers to minimize the disruption. Hi, Andy. Andy, let me start by saying, I hope you're right, and I hope seeing these large orders across different industries and different offerings becomes the rule rather than the exception. We are happy to see it. And the most recent one, as you said, was in e-commerce. We traditionally haven't called out in as much specificity the orders development from month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter. We thought during the pandemic, it made sense to give you that additional visibility. And it does show developing dynamic of having some of these large orders -- industries and in some cases, non-traditional offerings, so it gives us more ways to win. And so we're looking at that. We have seen a little bit of an uptick in large orders in general that began in Q2, and we would expect that to continue as our life cycle services segment kicks in, and that is where a fairly good proportion, our bigger traditional projects are home grown. So we do expect more of that to come. Majority of our business continues to be more run rate. We used to say $3 million to $5 million was a pretty big project for us. But now we're seeing an increasing frequency of bigger ones. I won't comment specifically on '22, but I really like the idea that our highest margin segment is also fastest growing, so that's a nice place to be. I've been very happy with the new perspectives that our new execs have brought to the organization and the way that the organization has embraced them. That's not easy to do, is to bring people in at a senior position into a well-established company with a long culture, a strong culture. But I've been very happy with the way that we brought in those new perspectives into the organization. Brian is focused on increasing the frequency and the impact of new product introductions, particularly around software. Scott's focused on doing the things to focus our sales force on delivering outcomes to customers and increasing our annual recurring revenue, great experience that he brings and high credibility as he works with our sales force. And obviously, as Nick said earlier, that the financial organization analyze the execution of this strategy are all good things. Hi, Steve. Good morning, Steve. Yes. Well -- and we wanted to call that out, because this is really before Lifecycle Services is kicking in full. So we're expecting a nice run of that magnitude of orders for the company over the next few quarters and this is primarily driven at this point with products. But again, as the project business ramps up, which is our expectation, that could deliver some continued nice results there. Thanks, Steve. Hey, Josh. Sure. So parts of the software business are still somewhat fragmented where you're largely competing against doing nothing on the part of our customer or a homegrown solution. And we still see a lot of that within, say, IoT applications. In MES, it's a little bit more, let's say, mature. And you are typically competing with a fairly well-known competitor, sometimes our traditional full scope automation competitors, sometimes niche competitors. And that visualization, I would say, is similar to that, which is a big part of our software offering. Again, a little bit more stratified, but there's the new applications, IoT, analytics, things like that. It's still a fairly diffuse, let's say, competitor landscape customers are looking for the outcomes. And you're also having to dovetail into an installed base. That's a big part of it, because a lot of your challenges come in the interfaces with existing installations, and that's why we've taken that open approach to expect that these customers already have software and hardware in place and don't want to rip it all out. With respect to cybersecurity, even apart from the hardware, we got a cybersecurity business that's over $100 million in terms of the services. It grew double digits, very strong. We're seeing good contribution from recent acquisitions of Avnet and Oilo, and that's an area that I'm particularly proud of, because it's an area that when we introduced it, it wasn't one that customers necessarily thought of Rockwell first for. But we're having a great impact on customers, and we're working with a whole new set of decision-makers, including the CIO and his or her team in some really big companies, so very happy with the development of that part of our business. Well, we're happy with it. That's why we've called it down. I want to make sure and you know this, Josh that the $2 billion is a company number, but we're notching that figure even before Lifecycle Services really kicks in like we expected to over the next couple of quarters. But yes, we're expecting that as we've created more ways to win, our strategy is to accelerate profitable growth. That's what we've been talking about in the last two years, doing it by growing as a higher multiple of industrial production in our core, continued double digits in Information Solutions and Connected Services and making acquisitions that are going to, again, give us more ways to win. Thanks Josh. Sure. Nigel, the primary applications are around facilities management. So it's making sure that the environment is clean and not the right temperature and the right humidity and so on. It's a fairly complex automation project, and that's our traditional area. Lately, we've had some success in increasing the scope even within that facilities management, including things like cybersecurity and other related services and networking. We see additional opportunity in the materials handling. And also, given that we are a good-sized user of electronic components and use circuit boards and so on. We've developed some artificial intelligence applications that have helped us be more productive, and we're working with some customers to acquaint them with our capabilities there as well. So, there's a lot of additional room expansion from that base. One of the ways, just for an example looking at our own MES software, when we added that into our operations over the last decade there were a couple of ways that, that increased our efficiency. It decreased work in process, and it also helped us with airproofing, to be able to have a defined workflow, so as our customers are having to bring new talent on that may be new to these types of operations, that workforce development is a big deal. And it sometimes sits right on the critical path of getting new capacity up and running. So whether it's the MES software that we've been offering, augmented reality offerings that we have with PTC. We've got some great solutions as well as the training that we provide to help with these new hires at our customers come online just as fast as possible. I also believe that the flexibility that we are adding in our own operations, and I mentioned earlier, in our own contactor facility here in Milwaukee, is giving us insight that we can impart to our customers to help them be more agile, to produce a wider variety of SKUs on a single line. I saw an application recently with a beverage company that's able to make a very wide range of packaging formats for beverages, using our independent cart technology. And it's a whole different game than it was 10 years ago in terms of different types of SKUs that these companies can create to maximize their shelf space and retail outlets. Yes, absolutely. Being able to take those real-time production signals and to be able to look upstream into that supply base, and just as you said, going deeper and before, it's not a nice to have anymore, it's a requirement to be able to look at those suppliers and to be able to marry that with your real-time production requirements, particularly when you're looking at increasingly multiple potential sources of supply for those components or those materials that you need. So, we see a lot of activity going forward. And you talk customers, nothing gets them more interested in when you talk about the role that we can play in a connected supply chain. There's huge amounts of additional productivity that we can help with their and our ecosystem. Because that's an area that ecosystem is going to play a very large role. Yes. Thanks, Noah. Thanks, Jessica. In summary, we're very pleased with our strong performance in the quarter. The recovery in manufacturing is accelerating at a much faster pace than we initially expected. Rockwell is extremely well positioned in this recovery, and we're especially excited about the new product introductions and services that we will bring to market over the next couple of years. It's an exciting time to be a part of the Rockwell journey. We thank you for your interest and ongoing support."

Before we begin discussing our results and outlook, I'd like to make a few opening remarks. On the leadership front, we have 2 exciting announcements today. First, we have hired Scott Genereux as our new Chief Revenue Officer. Scott built strong executive-level customer relationships and has spent most of his career leading global sales forces at major enterprise software and hardware companies. These include Oracle, and most recently, Veritas. And we're thrilled to bring him onboard in this newly created role. Scott will be responsible for all our worldwide sales and marketing efforts, leading our global go-to market strategies and accelerating Rockwell's growth, including software sales and annual recurring revenue. The second important announcement is that Brian Shepherd has been hired as the new leader of our Software & Control business segment. Brian has extensive experience in the industrial software space and joins Scott in bringing proven knowledge about ways to drive faster recurring revenue growth in our business. Prior to joining us, Brian was President of Production Software and Smart Factory Solutions, for Hexagon AB. And before that, was a long-time executive at PTC, where he led strategy and operations for their Enterprise Software segments. He has strong technical expertise across the design, operate and maintain phases of the customer journey and how industrial software can maximize customer value. We're excited to have them on board. Both Scott and Brian began on February 1. Finally, I'm happy to report we are well along in our CFO search and expect to make that announcement shortly. It's been a busy few months, but I'm very pleased with the new talent and fresh perspectives we're adding to our leadership team. In other news this quarter, we had very important win on the legal front. In Q1, Radwell International was found liable for trademark infringement and false advertising relating to its resale of Rockwell products. This latest legal victory underscores our commitment to protecting our intellectual property, as well as our authorized distribution network. We're using a portion of the gain that resulted from this ruling to make additional investments this year. This includes investments to pull forward software product launches that will increase recurring revenue in fiscal 2022 and beyond, as well as sustainability related investments to drive our ESG goals. With that, let me now turn to our Q1 results on Slide 3. In Q1, total reported sales declined 7%. Organic sales were down 10% versus prior year. Total sales included a 2 point positive contribution from our ASEM and Kalypso acquisitions. Note that Sensia is now included in our organic results. During the quarter, we saw a sharp acceleration in order intake, especially for our products. Total orders were back above pre-pandemic levels. The increased demand was broad based and well above our expectations and the higher order rates will benefit sales for the balance of the year. More on that in a moment. I'll now comment on our new business segments. Intelligent Devices' organic sales declined 8%. In the quarter, we saw positive year-over-year growth in Motion, where we believe we are gaining market share. Orders in this segment returned to positive growth a quarter ahead of our expectations. Software & Control organic sales declined 6%. In the quarter, we saw year-over-year growth in network and security infrastructure. Lifecycle Services' organic sales decline of 16% was led by continued weakness in oil and gas. We did see a 25% sequential uptick in Lifecycle Services orders in the quarter, which will drive sequential sales improvement through the balance of the year. In Information Solutions and Connected Services, organic sales were down slightly in the quarter, primarily due to COVID related project delays. However, we saw double-digit organic orders growth in IS as well as strong demand in the cybersecurity portion of Connected Services. IS/CS built backlog by about 30% versus prior year and we expect IS/CS to have a great year overall, growing double digits in fiscal 2021 with organic sales exceeding $500 million. Total backlog grew strong double digits on an organic basis both year-over-year and sequentially. Lifecycle Services book-to-bill reached a record of 1.18, reflecting a significant improvement both sequentially and year-over-year. Turning to profitability, segment operating margin performance of 20% in the quarter was roughly flat with last year on lower sales, a testament to our increasing business resilience. Adjusted EPS grew 11% versus prior year, including the legal settlement gain. Excluding the gain, adjusted EPS came in above our expectations for the quarter. Let's now turn to Slide 4, where I'll provide a few highlights of our Q1 end-market performance. Figures are for organic sales. Our discrete market segment sales declined by approximately 5%. However, we saw strong broad order momentum in the quarter, particularly in North America that should benefit sales performance for the remainder of the year. Automotive sales declined approximately 10% versus prior year with mid-single-digits growth in EMEA offset by tough comparisons in other regions. Our EV business significantly outperformed the rest of automotive and included key wins from a major auto brand-owner in Europe that is building a new line for EV battery manufacturing. We also won at a European Tier 1 OEM, who chose our Independent Cart Technology for the precision motion control necessary to build new electric vehicles. These were both hard-fought wins, where our strong customer support and technology differentiation were important factors in our success. Semiconductor grew low-single-digits in the quarter and is expected to improve significantly over the balance of the year. Strong secular tailwinds in this vertical are prompting some of our largest Semiconductor customers to increase their CapEx spend this year. As a result, we are raising our semiconductor outlook to high-single-digit growth for the year, up from our original guidance of mid-single-digit growth. Another highlight within Discrete was our performance in e-Commerce, with sales growing approximately 40% versus prior year. This is obviously another industry with secular tailwinds, and we are well-positioned to provide value that will continue to support its tremendous future growth. Our Independent Cart Technology is a long-term differentiator here, as it is in battery assembly and the packaging of consumer products. Turning now to our Hybrid market segment. This segment grew by low-single-digits and accounted for 45% of revenue this quarter. Food & Beverage grew low-single-digits. In addition, packaging OEMs delivered another quarter of double-digit growth versus the prior year. Life Sciences grew about 10% in Q1, well above our expectation for the quarter, led by strong broad-based demand in North America. Thermo Fisher is an important part of the vaccine ecosystem, and we were very proud this quarter to be awarded a significant multi-year enterprise software order to supply software and professional services to enable their Pharma 4.0 initiative and drive their COVID readiness and response. They chose Rockwell's FactoryTalk Innovation Suite which uniquely integrates MES, IIoT, Analytics and Augmented Reality in a single software solution to drive productivity. FTIS, in combination with strong pharma industry expertise, full lifecycle services, and best in breed digital partner ecosystem were key factors in why Thermo Fisher selected Rockwell. While there is a lot of focus on our role in vaccine formulation, we are also working with the broader vaccine ecosystem to support packaging and distribution requirements. For every one pallet of vaccines being shipped, 20 to 30 additional pallets of vaccine accessories are required. Based on the broad-based increase in life sciences demand, we are now expecting Life Sciences to grow mid-teens in fiscal 2021. Process markets were down approximately 25% and weaker than we expected, led by larger declines in Oil & Gas. Process verticals typically lag our discrete business by about half a year. Turning now to Slide 5, into our organic regional sales performance in the quarter. North America organic sales declined by 11% versus the prior year, primarily due to sales declines in Oil & Gas and Automotive. Business conditions improved significantly through the quarter and were reflected in strong product orders. EMEA sales declined 8%, led by Oil & Gas. Sales from Food & Beverage and Water customers were strong in the quarter. Sales in the Asia Pacific region declined 7%, largely due to declines in Process industries that were partially offset by growth in Mass Transit and Semiconductor. Asia Pacific backlog reached a record high in the quarter and we do expect strong sales growth in the region for both the upcoming quarter and full year. In China, we saw growth in auto with some important greenfield EV battery wins. Sequential orders growth in Q1 and double-digit year-over-year growth in backlog support our full-year sales growth outlook in China to be above the company average. Latin America declines were led by Oil & Gas and Mining. In the region, we saw good growth in Food & Beverage and Tire. Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review highlights for the full year outlook. Orders momentum in the first quarter is expected to drive strong growth in the balance of the year. The higher top-line guidance is primarily related to improvements in the outlook for Life Sciences and e-Commerce in North America, as well as in our global outlook for semiconductor growth. Our new reported sales outlook assumes 10% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, including 6% organic growth. We expect our new software offerings and expanded services will drive double-digit ARR growth in fiscal 2021. Our new hires will be focused on this objective. Our new Adjusted EPS target of $8.90 at the midpoint of the range represents 13% growth over the prior year. A more detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 7. I won't go into the details on this slide, but as you can see, we expect positive organic sales growth in all of our key end markets this year with the exception of Oil & Gas. A marked uptick in orders for Sensia in the latter part of Q1 sets the stage for improving sales later in the fiscal year. With that, let me now turn it over to Steve who will elaborate on our first quarter performance and updated financial outlook for fiscal 2021. Steve?\nSteve Etzel: Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8, first quarter key financial information. First quarter reported sales were down 7.1% year-over-year. Organic sales were down 9.7%. Acquisitions contributed 1.8 points of growth, and currency translation increased sales by 0.8 points. Segment operating margin was 19.8%, slightly below Q1 of last year. This is the second quarter in a row that segment margin was about flat year-over-year despite lower sales, so a good result. Corporate and other expense of $28 million was down about $5 million compared to last year. Last year's amount included transaction fees related to the formation of the Sensia joint venture. Note that previously we referred to this line item as general corporate-net. The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 15.4% compared to 8.3% last year. The increase in the tax rate is primarily due to a large discrete tax benefit recorded in Q1 last year related to the formation of Sensia and other discrete items. Moving on to EPS. As a reminder, beginning with this quarter we changed the definition of Adjusted EPS to also exclude the impact of purchase accounting depreciation and amortization expense. First quarter adjusted EPS was $2.38. As Blake mentioned earlier, this result includes $0.45 related to a favorable legal settlement. Adjusted EPS excluding the legal settlement was $1.93, identical to last quarter, and better than we expected. We are pleased with this result, since compared to last quarter, we were able to overcome a $0.30 headwind from the reinstatement of incentive compensation and the reversal of temporary cost actions as of the end of November. I'll cover a year-over-year Adjusted EPS bridge for Q1 on a later slide. Free cash flow was $319 million in the quarter, including the $70 million legal settlement. Free cash flow conversion was 115% of adjusted income. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased 356,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of about $88 million. This is in line with our full year placeholder of about $350 million. At December 31, $766 million remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our operating segments. As a reminder, this is the first quarter we're reporting under our new 3 segment structure. The Intelligent Devices segment had an organic sales decline of 7.9% in the quarter. Segment margin was 19.4%, 130 basis points lower than last year, mainly due to lower sales, partially offset by temporary and structural cost savings. As Blake highlighted earlier, we had strong orders performance in the quarter, particularly in our products businesses. Intelligent Devices orders grew low single digits year-over-year, and high-single-digits sequentially. Software & Control segment organic sales declined 6.2% in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed 2.7% to growth and segment margin was 30.2%, which was 80 basis points lower than last year's strong margin performance, mainly due to lower sales, partially offset by temporary and structural cost savings. Software & Control orders also grew low-single-digits year-over-year and high-single-digits sequentially. Organic sales of the Lifecycle Services segment declined 16.3% year-over-year, as the recovery in this segment's offerings tends to lag our products businesses. Acquisitions contributed 3.9% to growth. Operating margin for this segment increased 50 basis points to 8.9% versus 8.4% a year ago, despite lower sales. Contributing to the lower year-over-year margin improvement - I'm sorry, contributing to the year-over-year margin improvement were temporary and structural cost savings, and the absence of Sensia onetime items recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. First quarter book-to-bill performance for the Lifecycle Services segment was 1.18, a strong start to the year. The next Slide, 10, provides the Adjusted EPS walk from Q1 fiscal 2020 to Q1 fiscal 2021. Starting on the left, core performance had a negative impact of about $0.25 driven by lower organic sales. Temporary cost actions partially offset the sales impact by $0.20. These were the salary reductions and 401(k) match suspension that we implemented in Q3 of fiscal 2020, which remained in effect through the end of November 2020. Incentive compensation was a year-over-year headwind of about $0.10. Tax was a headwind of about $0.10, primarily due to the Sensia-related tax benefit recorded last year and other discrete items. Acquisitions contributed about $0.05. This represents the positive contribution from acquisitions that we completed in 2020 and so far in 2021. As a reminder, Sensia is now reported in core. Finally, as mentioned earlier, the legal settlement contributed $0.45 to Adjusted EPS. Moving to Slide 11, monthly product order trends. This slide shows our order - daily order trends for our Software & Control and Intelligent Devices segments, excluding the longer lead time configured-to-order offerings. The trends shown here account for about two-thirds of our overall sales. Order intake for products improved again this quarter, as the recovery continued. As you can see, there was a sharp acceleration in demand in November and December. Orders for the Lifecycle Services segment also improved in the quarter, but are recovering slower than product orders. The strong order performance resulted in record total company backlog, growing over 20% year-over-year and double digits sequentially. Our quarterly product order trends are shown on Slide 12. This is the same data as the prior slide, summarized by quarter. Our order levels in the first quarter are now clearly above pre-pandemic levels, both for products and the total company. This takes us to Slide 13, updated guidance. We are increasing our organic sales growth outlook by 1 point. The new range is 4.5% to 7.5%, with a mid-point of 6%. Given the weaker U.S. dollar, we now expect currency translation to contribute about 2.5% to growth. We expect acquisitions to contribute about 1.5%. In total, the midpoint of our reported sales guidance range is 10%. We have also updated the adjusted EPS guidance range to $8.70 to $9.10. I'll review the bridge from the prior guidance midpoint to the new $8.90 midpoint on the next slide. Segment operating margins is now expected to be about 19.5%. The lower margin compared to prior guidance reflects the software investments that Blake mentioned earlier and the impact of the Fiix acquisition. These will primarily affect the Software & Control segment and will be weighted toward the third and fourth quarters. Our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be about 14%, the same as prior guidance. As mentioned last quarter, this includes a 300 basis point benefit related to discrete items, which we expect to realize late in the fiscal year. We continue to project free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. A few additional comments on the fiscal 2021 guidance. Corporate and other expenses is expected to be between $105 million and $110 million. Purchase accounting amortization expense for the full year is expected to be about $50 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2021 is still expected to be between $90 million and $95 million. Finally, we're still assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 117 million shares. This takes us to Slide 14. This slide bridges the midpoint of our November adjusted EPS guidance range to the midpoint of our new guidance. Starting on the left. There is a higher contribution from core operating performance, primarily due to the higher organic sales guidance. Currency is projected to add about $0.05 compared to prior guidance. Next, given the increase in guidance, there is about a $0.10 impact from higher bonus expense. Finally, there is the $0.45 contribution from the Q1 legal settlement, partially offset by about $0.35 for the incremental investments and the impact of the Fiix acquisition. The new midpoint of the guidance range is $8.90. Finally, a couple of quick comments regarding fiscal Q2. Given our strong order performance in Q1, we expect Q2 sales to grow sequentially, and to be about flat year-over-year. We expect second half year-over-year organic sales growth in the mid to high teens. As a reminder, as we mentioned on the last earnings call, Q2 will have the largest year-over-year headwind from the reinstatement of the bonus in the range of $50 million. With that, I'll hand it back to Blake for some additional comments.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Steve. Historically, the pace of recovering demand for our products after a recession has come faster than we predicted when we were still in the downturn. This recovery is looking similar so far. And we will see Q2 sales and earnings begin to reflect the torrent of orders we received in November and December, with significant double-digit year-over-year growth expected in the second half of the year. The rate of infections in each region around the world has had a direct impact on the timing and rate of their respective economic recoveries. The Americas were last in and seem to be the last to recover with our sales most highly correlated to this geography, given our revenue there. We are working overtime to meet this demand and staying close to our components suppliers around the world. We're actively hiring and additional capacity for Logix is coming online this month. The new Milwaukee Manufacturing Center is working 2 shifts a day to keep pace with this increased level of orders activity. Turning to Slide 15, we're also investing in software development to drive our future growth. Last November at our Investor Day, we talked about how we will be releasing Software-as-a-Service within our FactoryTalk portfolio to add value in the design, operate and maintenance phases of the customers' investment lifecycle. The recent legal settlement gained will allow us to advance these deliverables. Recent acquisitions are playing an important role in these offerings as well, with Fiix software central to FactoryTalk Maintenance Hub within the Software & Control business segment. Fiix is already showing great momentum and just booked their first $1 million dollar annual recurring revenue contract. Their leadership is already a part of the larger plans for accelerating our SaaS offerings. It all begins with great people. And I continue to be immensely proud of our employees in all parts of the organization and around the world. We continue to hire top talent. And the 2 new members of the team we announced today will add to an already great leadership team. With that, let me pass the baton back to Jessica to begin the Q&A session.\nJessica Kourakos: Thanks, Blake. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and the quick follow-up. Thanks. Michelle, let's take our first question.\nOperator: Okay. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.\nKaren Lau: Hi, good morning, everyone. It's Karen Lau dialing in for John. Good morning.\nBlake Moret: Hey, Karen.\nKaren Lau: Hey. I was wondering, are there - have you guys seen any signs of maybe the order or sales conversions slowing down given the renewed flare-up in COVID cases around the world in Europe, China, and U.S. obviously? Have you seen any moderation in sales conversion? Understanding the order trends has been very strong, but curious, if there's any underlying moderation beneath maybe some sort of budget slash in the year and if you can comment on that?\nBlake Moret: Yeah, so a couple of pieces of that, first of all orders continued strong in the early part of January. So we don't see significant causal for what we saw through last quarter tailing off because of any sort of budget flush. So we see those trends continue. We do, obviously, continue to see challenges, particularly with our longer cycle solutions business due to continued mobility challenges, as infections have stayed high around the world. But we haven't seen any new obstacles placed with increased infections.\nKaren Lau: Okay, that's great to hear. And then my other question is on e-commerce. I don't recall you guys in the past calling out this end-market in particular. Obviously, it has been a very strong market for some time. So curious, if your positioning or anything has changed over there and maybe a comment - if you can comment on how big it is and what's like - how is your positioning and the potential and so forth?\nBlake Moret: Yes, so our role in distribution or fulfillment centers has always been good. We've always had a strong presence in the core automation there in terms of conveyors and sortation. It was a great fit for our core technology. What's changed and why we're talking more about it is, first, the explosive growth of the end-market itself, which I don't think shows much sign of slowing down. And 2, we do have even improved offerings to be able to serve that market. Independent Cart Technology is an example, where we really differentiate. We talked about that last quarter with respect to that Navy, when it differentiates us in e-commerce as well. And some of the potential opportunities there make the Navy order look small with respect to Independent Cart Technology as a form of precision motion control. So it's really a combination of the market expanding, as well as our readiness to serve going even higher. It's still a relatively small part of our total business. But we expect that to increase as a percentage of our total sales in the quarters and years to come.\nKaren Lau: That sounds great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open.\nTrish Gorman: Hey, good morning. This is Trish on for Julian. So maybe just a couple questions on the extra $0.35 of investments spent, maybe a little bit more color on the timing, of how we should expect that throughout the year? And then if this is a new run rate of investment spend or that should set down in 2022? And then just more broadly on margins, apart from the temporary cost reversals, is there anything abnormal to call out?\nBlake Moret: So I'll make a couple of comments. And then, Steve will add. The investment spend is expected to pull forward some of the development programs that we've been working on in our software area, and specifically, with an eye towards increasing the contribution of Software-as-a-Service to our annual recurring revenue next year. But it's expected to be onetime investments that we can make to accelerate it, not that automatically go into a run rate. And so the investments were selected specifically for that reason, to increase revenue beginning as soon as next year, but without going into an ongoing run rate.\nSteve Etzel: And as it relates to the $0.35, think of about $0.10 or so of that related to the Fiix acquisition, the dilution from that and the remainder to the software investments that Blake just described. And as it relates to the timing, you can think of it mostly affecting the third and fourth quarter of both items, and as well it's all in the Software & Control segment.\nTrish Gorman: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then maybe switching gears, in Asia sales down 7% seem to underperform factory automation, pure company. Can you just talk more about what's going on in that region and maybe what the business is specifically in China?\nBlake Moret: Sure. So, in general, our position in China is really strong with later cycle businesses. We've talked before about the higher percentage relatively towards longer lead time solutions, targeted at end users, as opposed to earlier cycle business that would be centered on indigenous machine builders. And I think you're seeing some of that play out with respect to China. Now, in China, we still see great opportunities, and we've had some exciting wins recently in EV, mass transit, water, wastewater, our software is a differentiator there. So I like our position there. But we're going to pick up the pace, so as we go after that market, with new opportunities, new go-to-market strategies to complement what we're already doing there.\nTrish Gorman: Got it. Thanks.\nBlake Moret: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Tusa from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nStephen Tusa: Hey, guys, good morning.\nBlake Moret: Hey, good morning.\nSteve Etzel: Hi, Steve.\nStephen Tusa: Can you just remind us of - on the kind of the product order trends? What's kind of the cycle time on those orders turning into sales?\nBlake Moret: So, those are typically characterized as weeks. In those trends, we excluded the longer lead time, configured to order lineups of Power Control. So when you look at those trends, those are typically turnarounds that are measured in weeks in average. A lot of that, of course, sits on our distributor shelf. So when an end customer places an order for it, then it can be fulfilled within hours or a few days.\nStephen Tusa: Right. So are you confident that this isn't - if that's the case, are you confident this isn't like a restock?\nBlake Moret: We are, because we have good visibility into our distributors' inventory management practices. And their buys are based on underlying end customer demand. So they'll be buying on us based on what they see from end users and integrators and panel builders. And the other point is that we saw continued strong orders into the first part of January. So we're not seeing any evidence that there's a large portion of this due to distributor restock, due to our visibility into their inventory management practices.\nStephen Tusa: Got it. And then, just one last one, it's kind of the raise of the organic guidance and the cut to the margin. You may have mentioned this earlier, but just curious as to what's driving that kind of lower leverage, if you will?\nBlake Moret: So some of it now, I'll ask Steve to top this up. But some of that is due to the investments we decided to make from a portion of the gain from that legal settlement we mentioned. So we made a decision to make investments that would be one-time investments in fiscal 2021 to pull forward the recurring revenue that we can get from certain strategic software development projects. So we expect to be releasing Software-as-a-Service for automation software, for information management through the next year and we expect that to impact our revenue next year. But importantly, this does not go into the run rate? So those increased investments were due to accelerate that, but they're not necessary as a part of a recurring spend base.\nSteve Etzel: Yeah, Steve, the other thing as well, the segment P&L that the subtle end game is outside of segment operating earnings, whereas these incremental investments, and the fixed impact are in segment operating earnings. So they're saying basically, the one side effect comes through the margin.\nStephen Tusa: Great. All right. Thanks for the color. I appreciate it.\nBlake Moret: Yeah.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Your line is open.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, guys.\nSteve Etzel: Hey, Andy.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Blake, it's not really a surprise that you took up your discrete and hybrid organic sales expectations and maybe took down process a little bit, but you did mention that you saw pickup at Sensia through the end of Q1. And obviously, we've seen a spike in commodity prices. So have you seen the stabilization now, overall process related bookings and have you seen any bigger uptick, especially on the mining side?\nBlake Moret: So the fundamentals for mining, particularly copper are encouraging given the price per pound of copper well above $3, while that presents a little bit of pressure on price for our materials. We don't use a lot of raw materials like that. So the potential benefit of new projects by the miners outweighs of any near-term cost pressure on us. I think, there are some big projects out there that we're looking at I know of a few that we're tracking in Latin America, we haven't seen it yet in terms of mining. But I would say we're more optimistic about that than in terms of a quick oil and gas recovery. On oil and gas, I did mention that we saw some good orders in Sensia towards the back half or of Q1. So the latter part of Q1, we did see some orders that will support the sequential sales improvement through the balance of the year for oil and gas.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: It's helpful, Blake. And then, just stepping back obviously you talked about orders picking up maybe faster than you expected. Could you talk about how much of the pickup you think is just sort of normal cyclical recovery versus the secular trends we've been talking about here, reshoring, step-ups and resilience to improve single source of failure? You talked about e-commerce a little bit, but also focused on ESG and energy transition, how much is all this stuff sort of helping with order recovery?\nBlake Moret: I think it fortifies the strength of the recovery. We have more ways to win. So it's not just the recovery of the general core automation and MRO spend having a larger software portfolio services; cybersecurity services that's in the neighborhood of $100 million for this year. These are offerings that we didn't really have in past downturns. And so I think we can participate more fully, as customers try to accelerate out of the curve, in terms of their digital transformation plans.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Thanks, Blake.\nBlake Moret: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Rick Eastman from Baird. Your line is open.\nRichard Eastman: Yes, good morning and thank you.\nBlake Moret: Hi, Rick.\nRichard Eastman: Blake, could you maybe speak to for a minute or 2? We've seen some fairly aggressive kind of EV expectations for the number of models here over the next 3 years. And I'm curious, your perspective there around the investments in bringing those models to market around EVs. How do you view that as - is that more than a zero-sum game versus investment in trailing ICE models? So maybe that's my first question. And then, just to follow on with that, are you starting to see some order growth around this significant EV model build forecast? Where does that spend kind of in a pipeline, if you will?\nBlake Moret: So we've always said that our auto business in general is based more on model changes, new models, new cockpit designs and things like that then the raw [SAR] [ph] count. And if you think of these EV launches as new models, then that's positive. And I think it is above a zero-sum game. So I think the opportunities are higher than just ICE going down, EV going up at the same amount. These are new projects, as we've also talked about, we can participate in all the traditional ways of that automation is needed to build a vehicle in terms of body and paint and stamping, and so on. But we also have a higher readiness to serve in the drive train with our capabilities in terms of battery assembly and so on. So there's a mix opportunity and a customer share opportunity there as well as the increased reliance on software to schedule the units in these EV plants. The MES offering that we have is being looked at as more market serving as opposed to a nice to have, it's being looked at is somewhat of an essential part of a modern automobile factory. So those were all very positive things. For us, I would also say if the focus on made in America pertains to fleets being made in the U.S., that's obviously a good thing for us as well, if given our strong position within that geography and within many of the EV brand owners.\nRichard Eastman: Very good. And then just as a follow-up around Life Sciences, again, we saw the strength in the book-to-bill there, and just maybe a thought, Blake, around - is our content greater within the life sciences marketplace? Or are we seeing just the accelerated spend kind of the pandemic, if you will, defensive spend that we're seeing across the board? Or is our content also greater there, as well?\nBlake Moret: Yeah, I think, it is expanded customer share as well as the market for automation and information expanding, you think about the things that we're providing to these companies. So it certainly includes the core automation and our capabilities in terms of formulation as well as packaging, track and trace. But then when you look at additional offerings that we can provide the software that we're providing, and again, in this face, it's not just on top of our core automation, it's on top of competitive control platforms. So it's another way to win. Augmented Reality that we have through our relationship with PTC is being used in many of these facilities. And then cybersecurity service is a very fast-growing part of our offering is something that's critically important to these life sciences' customers now more than ever.\nRichard Eastman: That's it. Great, thank you.\nBlake Moret: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is open.\nJoseph Giordano: Hey, guys, good morning.\nBlake Moret: Good morning, Joe.\nJoseph Giordano: Hey, just curious on auto, obviously, you have a big ramp in the rest of the year. With the shortage going on in semiconductors, obviously, you're not on the production vehicle side of things. But what's the risk that if that drags on longer that it delayed some of the investments then in putting the equipment in place?\nBlake Moret: I think, particularly on the EV side, these companies know they need to get units out in the market and an offering to begin to get revenue there. So I think it's given them a lot of headaches. But I still see a pretty dramatic uptake in the size of the project funnel that we're looking at in automotive. So when you look at that funnel of CapEx projects with an auto, our folks are telling us that they're really seeing a pretty market increase in that funnel. I think that, again, the semiconductor shortages that they're fighting with are going to be a hassle for them, but I don't see it causing them to add significant additional delays to these major projects, because they know they have to get their brands out there in the EV market.\nJoseph Giordano: Okay, great. And then just last for me, the temporary savings was a benefit this quarter does that flip to a give back starting next quarter?\nSteve Etzel: So year-over-year the temporary savings should now be a net-zero basically for Q2, we've restored the salaries and the 401(k) match, so that's basically a net-zero year-over-year. Now we have talked about the bonus, which is a big year-over-year headwind in Q2, it's about $50 million. Last year, we've reversed all of our bonus accruals in the second quarter due to the downturn, and this year, we're accruing a little above target now.\nJoseph Giordano: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nBlake Moret: Thank you.\nOperator: And our final question for today will come from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nNoah Kaye: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. It was really just on the software accelerated investment here, I'm trying to understand kind of combining this with you're bringing in a Chief Revenue Officer. And then, how much of that spend is really for actual product development versus a go-to market change or an investment in the selling infrastructure? Do you feel you have the rights to put sales infrastructure in place to accelerate the adoption of Software-as-a-Service? Any kind of changes you think you need to make in sort of the selling strategy or the business model there? If you can talk about that, that'd be helpful.\nBlake Moret: Sure. The vast majority of the additional spend that we're making is in the development of the software. So it's in Software-as-a-Service that will be start to release in the coming months and over the next year or so. And it's our automation software. So this is right at the core of what we do, interfacing with our intelligent devices and leveraging that home-field advantage that we have really right at that convergence of IT and operational technology. So it's mostly going into the software development. Because as I said, it's mainly a onetime investment, that doesn't go into our ongoing run rate. We've previously talked about doubling the number of our software specialist, assisting our general account managers, that's not a onetime cost. That's an investment that we've previously talked about and that is increasing. Our approach is really twofold with respect to selling more software. We have a large and growing number of software specialists, as well as technical consultants to assist with those sales. And then, we've got our general account managers who more and more are coming in with inherent software understanding as well. They've got big portfolios to sell to our customers. But I like that, I like having a single account manager that can draw on these various resources, because it simplifies how our customers interact with us and it also puts an emphasis on solutions, because we sell our software, but it is part of a collection of offerings that provide outcomes to those customers. So it typically involves hardware. And it involves software, it involves services. And sometimes we're actually integrating the project ourself. One of the things that Scott brings into the CRO role is a really good understanding of how all those things come together, and how it is provided to the customer as a solution, and how to describe that to increasingly senior levels of our customers, because it's not just selling to plant engineers, plant managers and design engineers. We're a bigger part of our customers' digital transformation with this expanded portfolio. And so, we're talking to people higher up in the company.\nNoah Kaye: That makes a lot of sense. And thank you for the color. And then I wanted to just touch the last. So you mentioned there is a portion of the investment you talked that is for ESG spend. And I was curious if you could give us just a little bit of details on that. I don't know you could care to quantify it. But in general, what is that spend driving towards?\nBlake Moret: Sure. Just so a couple of things, I mean, we announced our carbon-neutral goals during investor day. And so, that's what we're doing within our own facilities. And so, we are spending sizable amount of money, I mean, in the millions of dollars to make sure that we are going at a fast pace in terms of advancing those ESG goals in our own shop. But maybe even more important as an overall impact is what we can do for customers. We've always had a big impact on their energy efficiency in their plants. But there are other areas like recycling and our role in the circular economy, renewables, those are things that we're looking at new offerings in to be able to help our customers meet their own ESG goals.\nNoah Kaye: Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nBlake Moret: Thank you.\nOperator: This brings us to the end of our Q&A session. I turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks.\nJessica Kourakos: Thanks, Michelle. I'll now turn it back to Blake for a few final comments.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Jessica. In summary, we are very pleased with our very strong orders performance in the quarter. The recovery in manufacturing is clearly happening at a much faster pace than we were anticipating. And we expect that to result in strong revenue growth for the balance of the fiscal year. We're very excited about the new software product launches that we have lined up over the next 12 to 24 months, and the new talent we are bringing on board with Fiix and Oylo as well as our new leadership additions that will accelerate our growth and drive higher recurring revenue in the future. Nobody is better positioned than Rockwell and our partners to bring Information Technology and Industrial Operational Technology together. It is an exciting time to be aligned with Rockwell. And we thank you for your interest and ongoing support. Be well.",

            "name": "Steve Etzel",
            "content": "Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8, first quarter key financial information. First quarter reported sales were down 7.1% year-over-year. Organic sales were down 9.7%. Acquisitions contributed 1.8 points of growth, and currency translation increased sales by 0.8 points. Segment operating margin was 19.8%, slightly below Q1 of last year. This is the second quarter in a row that segment margin was about flat year-over-year despite lower sales, so a good result. Corporate and other expense of $28 million was down about $5 million compared to last year. Last year's amount included transaction fees related to the formation of the Sensia joint venture. Note that previously we referred to this line item as general corporate-net. The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 15.4% compared to 8.3% last year. The increase in the tax rate is primarily due to a large discrete tax benefit recorded in Q1 last year related to the formation of Sensia and other discrete items. Moving on to EPS. As a reminder, beginning with this quarter we changed the definition of Adjusted EPS to also exclude the impact of purchase accounting depreciation and amortization expense. First quarter adjusted EPS was $2.38. As Blake mentioned earlier, this result includes $0.45 related to a favorable legal settlement. Adjusted EPS excluding the legal settlement was $1.93, identical to last quarter, and better than we expected. We are pleased with this result, since compared to last quarter, we were able to overcome a $0.30 headwind from the reinstatement of incentive compensation and the reversal of temporary cost actions as of the end of November. I'll cover a year-over-year Adjusted EPS bridge for Q1 on a later slide. Free cash flow was $319 million in the quarter, including the $70 million legal settlement. Free cash flow conversion was 115% of adjusted income. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased 356,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of about $88 million. This is in line with our full year placeholder of about $350 million. At December 31, $766 million remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our operating segments. As a reminder, this is the first quarter we're reporting under our new 3 segment structure. The Intelligent Devices segment had an organic sales decline of 7.9% in the quarter. Segment margin was 19.4%, 130 basis points lower than last year, mainly due to lower sales, partially offset by temporary and structural cost savings. As Blake highlighted earlier, we had strong orders performance in the quarter, particularly in our products businesses. Intelligent Devices orders grew low single digits year-over-year, and high-single-digits sequentially. Software & Control segment organic sales declined 6.2% in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed 2.7% to growth and segment margin was 30.2%, which was 80 basis points lower than last year's strong margin performance, mainly due to lower sales, partially offset by temporary and structural cost savings. Software & Control orders also grew low-single-digits year-over-year and high-single-digits sequentially. Organic sales of the Lifecycle Services segment declined 16.3% year-over-year, as the recovery in this segment's offerings tends to lag our products businesses. Acquisitions contributed 3.9% to growth. Operating margin for this segment increased 50 basis points to 8.9% versus 8.4% a year ago, despite lower sales. Contributing to the lower year-over-year margin improvement - I'm sorry, contributing to the year-over-year margin improvement were temporary and structural cost savings, and the absence of Sensia onetime items recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. First quarter book-to-bill performance for the Lifecycle Services segment was 1.18, a strong start to the year. The next Slide, 10, provides the Adjusted EPS walk from Q1 fiscal 2020 to Q1 fiscal 2021. Starting on the left, core performance had a negative impact of about $0.25 driven by lower organic sales. Temporary cost actions partially offset the sales impact by $0.20. These were the salary reductions and 401(k) match suspension that we implemented in Q3 of fiscal 2020, which remained in effect through the end of November 2020. Incentive compensation was a year-over-year headwind of about $0.10. Tax was a headwind of about $0.10, primarily due to the Sensia-related tax benefit recorded last year and other discrete items. Acquisitions contributed about $0.05. This represents the positive contribution from acquisitions that we completed in 2020 and so far in 2021. As a reminder, Sensia is now reported in core. Finally, as mentioned earlier, the legal settlement contributed $0.45 to Adjusted EPS. Moving to Slide 11, monthly product order trends. This slide shows our order - daily order trends for our Software & Control and Intelligent Devices segments, excluding the longer lead time configured-to-order offerings. The trends shown here account for about two-thirds of our overall sales. Order intake for products improved again this quarter, as the recovery continued. As you can see, there was a sharp acceleration in demand in November and December. Orders for the Lifecycle Services segment also improved in the quarter, but are recovering slower than product orders. The strong order performance resulted in record total company backlog, growing over 20% year-over-year and double digits sequentially. Our quarterly product order trends are shown on Slide 12. This is the same data as the prior slide, summarized by quarter. Our order levels in the first quarter are now clearly above pre-pandemic levels, both for products and the total company. This takes us to Slide 13, updated guidance. We are increasing our organic sales growth outlook by 1 point. The new range is 4.5% to 7.5%, with a mid-point of 6%. Given the weaker U.S. dollar, we now expect currency translation to contribute about 2.5% to growth. We expect acquisitions to contribute about 1.5%. In total, the midpoint of our reported sales guidance range is 10%. We have also updated the adjusted EPS guidance range to $8.70 to $9.10. I'll review the bridge from the prior guidance midpoint to the new $8.90 midpoint on the next slide. Segment operating margins is now expected to be about 19.5%. The lower margin compared to prior guidance reflects the software investments that Blake mentioned earlier and the impact of the Fiix acquisition. These will primarily affect the Software & Control segment and will be weighted toward the third and fourth quarters. Our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be about 14%, the same as prior guidance. As mentioned last quarter, this includes a 300 basis point benefit related to discrete items, which we expect to realize late in the fiscal year. We continue to project free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. A few additional comments on the fiscal 2021 guidance. Corporate and other expenses is expected to be between $105 million and $110 million. Purchase accounting amortization expense for the full year is expected to be about $50 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2021 is still expected to be between $90 million and $95 million. Finally, we're still assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 117 million shares. This takes us to Slide 14. This slide bridges the midpoint of our November adjusted EPS guidance range to the midpoint of our new guidance. Starting on the left. There is a higher contribution from core operating performance, primarily due to the higher organic sales guidance. Currency is projected to add about $0.05 compared to prior guidance. Next, given the increase in guidance, there is about a $0.10 impact from higher bonus expense. Finally, there is the $0.45 contribution from the Q1 legal settlement, partially offset by about $0.35 for the incremental investments and the impact of the Fiix acquisition. The new midpoint of the guidance range is $8.90. Finally, a couple of quick comments regarding fiscal Q2. Given our strong order performance in Q1, we expect Q2 sales to grow sequentially, and to be about flat year-over-year. We expect second half year-over-year organic sales growth in the mid to high teens. As a reminder, as we mentioned on the last earnings call, Q2 will have the largest year-over-year headwind from the reinstatement of the bonus in the range of $50 million. With that, I'll hand it back to Blake for some additional comments. And as it relates to the $0.35, think of about $0.10 or so of that related to the Fiix acquisition, the dilution from that and the remainder to the software investments that Blake just described. And as it relates to the timing, you can think of it mostly affecting the third and fourth quarter of both items, and as well it's all in the Software & Control segment. Hi, Steve. Yeah, Steve, the other thing as well, the segment P&L that the subtle end game is outside of segment operating earnings, whereas these incremental investments, and the fixed impact are in segment operating earnings. So they're saying basically, the one side effect comes through the margin. Hey, Andy. So year-over-year the temporary savings should now be a net-zero basically for Q2, we've restored the salaries and the 401(k) match, so that's basically a net-zero year-over-year. Now we have talked about the bonus, which is a big year-over-year headwind in Q2, it's about $50 million. Last year, we've reversed all of our bonus accruals in the second quarter due to the downturn, and this year, we're accruing a little above target now."

            "name": "Blake Moret",
            "content": "Thanks, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Before we begin discussing our results and outlook, I'd like to make a few opening remarks. On the leadership front, we have 2 exciting announcements today. First, we have hired Scott Genereux as our new Chief Revenue Officer. Scott built strong executive-level customer relationships and has spent most of his career leading global sales forces at major enterprise software and hardware companies. These include Oracle, and most recently, Veritas. And we're thrilled to bring him onboard in this newly created role. Scott will be responsible for all our worldwide sales and marketing efforts, leading our global go-to market strategies and accelerating Rockwell's growth, including software sales and annual recurring revenue. The second important announcement is that Brian Shepherd has been hired as the new leader of our Software & Control business segment. Brian has extensive experience in the industrial software space and joins Scott in bringing proven knowledge about ways to drive faster recurring revenue growth in our business. Prior to joining us, Brian was President of Production Software and Smart Factory Solutions, for Hexagon AB. And before that, was a long-time executive at PTC, where he led strategy and operations for their Enterprise Software segments. He has strong technical expertise across the design, operate and maintain phases of the customer journey and how industrial software can maximize customer value. We're excited to have them on board. Both Scott and Brian began on February 1. Finally, I'm happy to report we are well along in our CFO search and expect to make that announcement shortly. It's been a busy few months, but I'm very pleased with the new talent and fresh perspectives we're adding to our leadership team. In other news this quarter, we had very important win on the legal front. In Q1, Radwell International was found liable for trademark infringement and false advertising relating to its resale of Rockwell products. This latest legal victory underscores our commitment to protecting our intellectual property, as well as our authorized distribution network. We're using a portion of the gain that resulted from this ruling to make additional investments this year. This includes investments to pull forward software product launches that will increase recurring revenue in fiscal 2022 and beyond, as well as sustainability related investments to drive our ESG goals. With that, let me now turn to our Q1 results on Slide 3. In Q1, total reported sales declined 7%. Organic sales were down 10% versus prior year. Total sales included a 2 point positive contribution from our ASEM and Kalypso acquisitions. Note that Sensia is now included in our organic results. During the quarter, we saw a sharp acceleration in order intake, especially for our products. Total orders were back above pre-pandemic levels. The increased demand was broad based and well above our expectations and the higher order rates will benefit sales for the balance of the year. More on that in a moment. I'll now comment on our new business segments. Intelligent Devices' organic sales declined 8%. In the quarter, we saw positive year-over-year growth in Motion, where we believe we are gaining market share. Orders in this segment returned to positive growth a quarter ahead of our expectations. Software & Control organic sales declined 6%. In the quarter, we saw year-over-year growth in network and security infrastructure. Lifecycle Services' organic sales decline of 16% was led by continued weakness in oil and gas. We did see a 25% sequential uptick in Lifecycle Services orders in the quarter, which will drive sequential sales improvement through the balance of the year. In Information Solutions and Connected Services, organic sales were down slightly in the quarter, primarily due to COVID related project delays. However, we saw double-digit organic orders growth in IS as well as strong demand in the cybersecurity portion of Connected Services. IS/CS built backlog by about 30% versus prior year and we expect IS/CS to have a great year overall, growing double digits in fiscal 2021 with organic sales exceeding $500 million. Total backlog grew strong double digits on an organic basis both year-over-year and sequentially. Lifecycle Services book-to-bill reached a record of 1.18, reflecting a significant improvement both sequentially and year-over-year. Turning to profitability, segment operating margin performance of 20% in the quarter was roughly flat with last year on lower sales, a testament to our increasing business resilience. Adjusted EPS grew 11% versus prior year, including the legal settlement gain. Excluding the gain, adjusted EPS came in above our expectations for the quarter. Let's now turn to Slide 4, where I'll provide a few highlights of our Q1 end-market performance. Figures are for organic sales. Our discrete market segment sales declined by approximately 5%. However, we saw strong broad order momentum in the quarter, particularly in North America that should benefit sales performance for the remainder of the year. Automotive sales declined approximately 10% versus prior year with mid-single-digits growth in EMEA offset by tough comparisons in other regions. Our EV business significantly outperformed the rest of automotive and included key wins from a major auto brand-owner in Europe that is building a new line for EV battery manufacturing. We also won at a European Tier 1 OEM, who chose our Independent Cart Technology for the precision motion control necessary to build new electric vehicles. These were both hard-fought wins, where our strong customer support and technology differentiation were important factors in our success. Semiconductor grew low-single-digits in the quarter and is expected to improve significantly over the balance of the year. Strong secular tailwinds in this vertical are prompting some of our largest Semiconductor customers to increase their CapEx spend this year. As a result, we are raising our semiconductor outlook to high-single-digit growth for the year, up from our original guidance of mid-single-digit growth. Another highlight within Discrete was our performance in e-Commerce, with sales growing approximately 40% versus prior year. This is obviously another industry with secular tailwinds, and we are well-positioned to provide value that will continue to support its tremendous future growth. Our Independent Cart Technology is a long-term differentiator here, as it is in battery assembly and the packaging of consumer products. Turning now to our Hybrid market segment. This segment grew by low-single-digits and accounted for 45% of revenue this quarter. Food & Beverage grew low-single-digits. In addition, packaging OEMs delivered another quarter of double-digit growth versus the prior year. Life Sciences grew about 10% in Q1, well above our expectation for the quarter, led by strong broad-based demand in North America. Thermo Fisher is an important part of the vaccine ecosystem, and we were very proud this quarter to be awarded a significant multi-year enterprise software order to supply software and professional services to enable their Pharma 4.0 initiative and drive their COVID readiness and response. They chose Rockwell's FactoryTalk Innovation Suite which uniquely integrates MES, IIoT, Analytics and Augmented Reality in a single software solution to drive productivity. FTIS, in combination with strong pharma industry expertise, full lifecycle services, and best in breed digital partner ecosystem were key factors in why Thermo Fisher selected Rockwell. While there is a lot of focus on our role in vaccine formulation, we are also working with the broader vaccine ecosystem to support packaging and distribution requirements. For every one pallet of vaccines being shipped, 20 to 30 additional pallets of vaccine accessories are required. Based on the broad-based increase in life sciences demand, we are now expecting Life Sciences to grow mid-teens in fiscal 2021. Process markets were down approximately 25% and weaker than we expected, led by larger declines in Oil & Gas. Process verticals typically lag our discrete business by about half a year. Turning now to Slide 5, into our organic regional sales performance in the quarter. North America organic sales declined by 11% versus the prior year, primarily due to sales declines in Oil & Gas and Automotive. Business conditions improved significantly through the quarter and were reflected in strong product orders. EMEA sales declined 8%, led by Oil & Gas. Sales from Food & Beverage and Water customers were strong in the quarter. Sales in the Asia Pacific region declined 7%, largely due to declines in Process industries that were partially offset by growth in Mass Transit and Semiconductor. Asia Pacific backlog reached a record high in the quarter and we do expect strong sales growth in the region for both the upcoming quarter and full year. In China, we saw growth in auto with some important greenfield EV battery wins. Sequential orders growth in Q1 and double-digit year-over-year growth in backlog support our full-year sales growth outlook in China to be above the company average. Latin America declines were led by Oil & Gas and Mining. In the region, we saw good growth in Food & Beverage and Tire. Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review highlights for the full year outlook. Orders momentum in the first quarter is expected to drive strong growth in the balance of the year. The higher top-line guidance is primarily related to improvements in the outlook for Life Sciences and e-Commerce in North America, as well as in our global outlook for semiconductor growth. Our new reported sales outlook assumes 10% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, including 6% organic growth. We expect our new software offerings and expanded services will drive double-digit ARR growth in fiscal 2021. Our new hires will be focused on this objective. Our new Adjusted EPS target of $8.90 at the midpoint of the range represents 13% growth over the prior year. A more detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 7. I won't go into the details on this slide, but as you can see, we expect positive organic sales growth in all of our key end markets this year with the exception of Oil & Gas. A marked uptick in orders for Sensia in the latter part of Q1 sets the stage for improving sales later in the fiscal year. With that, let me now turn it over to Steve who will elaborate on our first quarter performance and updated financial outlook for fiscal 2021. Steve? Thanks, Steve. Historically, the pace of recovering demand for our products after a recession has come faster than we predicted when we were still in the downturn. This recovery is looking similar so far. And we will see Q2 sales and earnings begin to reflect the torrent of orders we received in November and December, with significant double-digit year-over-year growth expected in the second half of the year. The rate of infections in each region around the world has had a direct impact on the timing and rate of their respective economic recoveries. The Americas were last in and seem to be the last to recover with our sales most highly correlated to this geography, given our revenue there. We are working overtime to meet this demand and staying close to our components suppliers around the world. We're actively hiring and additional capacity for Logix is coming online this month. The new Milwaukee Manufacturing Center is working 2 shifts a day to keep pace with this increased level of orders activity. Turning to Slide 15, we're also investing in software development to drive our future growth. Last November at our Investor Day, we talked about how we will be releasing Software-as-a-Service within our FactoryTalk portfolio to add value in the design, operate and maintenance phases of the customers' investment lifecycle. The recent legal settlement gained will allow us to advance these deliverables. Recent acquisitions are playing an important role in these offerings as well, with Fiix software central to FactoryTalk Maintenance Hub within the Software & Control business segment. Fiix is already showing great momentum and just booked their first $1 million dollar annual recurring revenue contract. Their leadership is already a part of the larger plans for accelerating our SaaS offerings. It all begins with great people. And I continue to be immensely proud of our employees in all parts of the organization and around the world. We continue to hire top talent. And the 2 new members of the team we announced today will add to an already great leadership team. With that, let me pass the baton back to Jessica to begin the Q&A session. Hey, Karen. Yeah, so a couple of pieces of that, first of all orders continued strong in the early part of January. So we don't see significant causal for what we saw through last quarter tailing off because of any sort of budget flush. So we see those trends continue. We do, obviously, continue to see challenges, particularly with our longer cycle solutions business due to continued mobility challenges, as infections have stayed high around the world. But we haven't seen any new obstacles placed with increased infections. Yes, so our role in distribution or fulfillment centers has always been good. We've always had a strong presence in the core automation there in terms of conveyors and sortation. It was a great fit for our core technology. What's changed and why we're talking more about it is, first, the explosive growth of the end-market itself, which I don't think shows much sign of slowing down. And 2, we do have even improved offerings to be able to serve that market. Independent Cart Technology is an example, where we really differentiate. We talked about that last quarter with respect to that Navy, when it differentiates us in e-commerce as well. And some of the potential opportunities there make the Navy order look small with respect to Independent Cart Technology as a form of precision motion control. So it's really a combination of the market expanding, as well as our readiness to serve going even higher. It's still a relatively small part of our total business. But we expect that to increase as a percentage of our total sales in the quarters and years to come. So I'll make a couple of comments. And then, Steve will add. The investment spend is expected to pull forward some of the development programs that we've been working on in our software area, and specifically, with an eye towards increasing the contribution of Software-as-a-Service to our annual recurring revenue next year. But it's expected to be onetime investments that we can make to accelerate it, not that automatically go into a run rate. And so the investments were selected specifically for that reason, to increase revenue beginning as soon as next year, but without going into an ongoing run rate. Sure. So, in general, our position in China is really strong with later cycle businesses. We've talked before about the higher percentage relatively towards longer lead time solutions, targeted at end users, as opposed to earlier cycle business that would be centered on indigenous machine builders. And I think you're seeing some of that play out with respect to China. Now, in China, we still see great opportunities, and we've had some exciting wins recently in EV, mass transit, water, wastewater, our software is a differentiator there. So I like our position there. But we're going to pick up the pace, so as we go after that market, with new opportunities, new go-to-market strategies to complement what we're already doing there. Thank you. Hey, good morning. So, those are typically characterized as weeks. In those trends, we excluded the longer lead time, configured to order lineups of Power Control. So when you look at those trends, those are typically turnarounds that are measured in weeks in average. A lot of that, of course, sits on our distributor shelf. So when an end customer places an order for it, then it can be fulfilled within hours or a few days. We are, because we have good visibility into our distributors' inventory management practices. And their buys are based on underlying end customer demand. So they'll be buying on us based on what they see from end users and integrators and panel builders. And the other point is that we saw continued strong orders into the first part of January. So we're not seeing any evidence that there's a large portion of this due to distributor restock, due to our visibility into their inventory management practices. So some of it now, I'll ask Steve to top this up. But some of that is due to the investments we decided to make from a portion of the gain from that legal settlement we mentioned. So we made a decision to make investments that would be one-time investments in fiscal 2021 to pull forward the recurring revenue that we can get from certain strategic software development projects. So we expect to be releasing Software-as-a-Service for automation software, for information management through the next year and we expect that to impact our revenue next year. But importantly, this does not go into the run rate? So those increased investments were due to accelerate that, but they're not necessary as a part of a recurring spend base. Yeah. So the fundamentals for mining, particularly copper are encouraging given the price per pound of copper well above $3, while that presents a little bit of pressure on price for our materials. We don't use a lot of raw materials like that. So the potential benefit of new projects by the miners outweighs of any near-term cost pressure on us. I think, there are some big projects out there that we're looking at I know of a few that we're tracking in Latin America, we haven't seen it yet in terms of mining. But I would say we're more optimistic about that than in terms of a quick oil and gas recovery. On oil and gas, I did mention that we saw some good orders in Sensia towards the back half or of Q1. So the latter part of Q1, we did see some orders that will support the sequential sales improvement through the balance of the year for oil and gas. I think it fortifies the strength of the recovery. We have more ways to win. So it's not just the recovery of the general core automation and MRO spend having a larger software portfolio services; cybersecurity services that's in the neighborhood of $100 million for this year. These are offerings that we didn't really have in past downturns. And so I think we can participate more fully, as customers try to accelerate out of the curve, in terms of their digital transformation plans. Thank you. Hi, Rick. So we've always said that our auto business in general is based more on model changes, new models, new cockpit designs and things like that then the raw [SAR] [ph] count. And if you think of these EV launches as new models, then that's positive. And I think it is above a zero-sum game. So I think the opportunities are higher than just ICE going down, EV going up at the same amount. These are new projects, as we've also talked about, we can participate in all the traditional ways of that automation is needed to build a vehicle in terms of body and paint and stamping, and so on. But we also have a higher readiness to serve in the drive train with our capabilities in terms of battery assembly and so on. So there's a mix opportunity and a customer share opportunity there as well as the increased reliance on software to schedule the units in these EV plants. The MES offering that we have is being looked at as more market serving as opposed to a nice to have, it's being looked at is somewhat of an essential part of a modern automobile factory. So those were all very positive things. For us, I would also say if the focus on made in America pertains to fleets being made in the U.S., that's obviously a good thing for us as well, if given our strong position within that geography and within many of the EV brand owners. Yeah, I think, it is expanded customer share as well as the market for automation and information expanding, you think about the things that we're providing to these companies. So it certainly includes the core automation and our capabilities in terms of formulation as well as packaging, track and trace. But then when you look at additional offerings that we can provide the software that we're providing, and again, in this face, it's not just on top of our core automation, it's on top of competitive control platforms. So it's another way to win. Augmented Reality that we have through our relationship with PTC is being used in many of these facilities. And then cybersecurity service is a very fast-growing part of our offering is something that's critically important to these life sciences' customers now more than ever. Thank you. Good morning, Joe. I think, particularly on the EV side, these companies know they need to get units out in the market and an offering to begin to get revenue there. So I think it's given them a lot of headaches. But I still see a pretty dramatic uptake in the size of the project funnel that we're looking at in automotive. So when you look at that funnel of CapEx projects with an auto, our folks are telling us that they're really seeing a pretty market increase in that funnel. I think that, again, the semiconductor shortages that they're fighting with are going to be a hassle for them, but I don't see it causing them to add significant additional delays to these major projects, because they know they have to get their brands out there in the EV market. Thank you. Sure. The vast majority of the additional spend that we're making is in the development of the software. So it's in Software-as-a-Service that will be start to release in the coming months and over the next year or so. And it's our automation software. So this is right at the core of what we do, interfacing with our intelligent devices and leveraging that home-field advantage that we have really right at that convergence of IT and operational technology. So it's mostly going into the software development. Because as I said, it's mainly a onetime investment, that doesn't go into our ongoing run rate. We've previously talked about doubling the number of our software specialist, assisting our general account managers, that's not a onetime cost. That's an investment that we've previously talked about and that is increasing. Our approach is really twofold with respect to selling more software. We have a large and growing number of software specialists, as well as technical consultants to assist with those sales. And then, we've got our general account managers who more and more are coming in with inherent software understanding as well. They've got big portfolios to sell to our customers. But I like that, I like having a single account manager that can draw on these various resources, because it simplifies how our customers interact with us and it also puts an emphasis on solutions, because we sell our software, but it is part of a collection of offerings that provide outcomes to those customers. So it typically involves hardware. And it involves software, it involves services. And sometimes we're actually integrating the project ourself. One of the things that Scott brings into the CRO role is a really good understanding of how all those things come together, and how it is provided to the customer as a solution, and how to describe that to increasingly senior levels of our customers, because it's not just selling to plant engineers, plant managers and design engineers. We're a bigger part of our customers' digital transformation with this expanded portfolio. And so, we're talking to people higher up in the company. Sure. Just so a couple of things, I mean, we announced our carbon-neutral goals during investor day. And so, that's what we're doing within our own facilities. And so, we are spending sizable amount of money, I mean, in the millions of dollars to make sure that we are going at a fast pace in terms of advancing those ESG goals in our own shop. But maybe even more important as an overall impact is what we can do for customers. We've always had a big impact on their energy efficiency in their plants. But there are other areas like recycling and our role in the circular economy, renewables, those are things that we're looking at new offerings in to be able to help our customers meet their own ESG goals. Thank you. Thanks, Jessica. In summary, we are very pleased with our very strong orders performance in the quarter. The recovery in manufacturing is clearly happening at a much faster pace than we were anticipating. And we expect that to result in strong revenue growth for the balance of the fiscal year. We're very excited about the new software product launches that we have lined up over the next 12 to 24 months, and the new talent we are bringing on board with Fiix and Oylo as well as our new leadership additions that will accelerate our growth and drive higher recurring revenue in the future. Nobody is better positioned than Rockwell and our partners to bring Information Technology and Industrial Operational Technology together. It is an exciting time to be aligned with Rockwell. And we thank you for your interest and ongoing support. Be well."

Later in the call, we will open up the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead.\nAijana Zellner: Thank you, Julianne. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation\u2019s Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include in our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today\u2019s call. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties and that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. So with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Blake.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let\u2019s turn to our fourth quarter results on Slide 3. We had a great finish to the fiscal year and delivered very strong operating performance. I\u2019m proud of how our teams navigated this challenging year with continued supply chain volatility, significant inflation and currency headwinds. Our Q4 results were in line with our expectations with organic sales and earnings, both growing double-digits year-over-year and sequentially. Orders came in as expected in the quarter. Our record backlog, along with very low order cancellation rates reflect the continued solid underlying demand from our customers across many industries and regions. Total revenue of over $2.1 billion was up 17.6% year-over-year. Organic sales grew 20.5% versus prior year in line with our expectations. Acquisitions contributed almost two points of growth this quarter. Currency translation reduced sales by about 5%, driven by continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. As expected, we continue to see a gradual stabilization of global supply chain. Similar to last quarter, the split of Q4 shipments by business segment and region was driven by access to specific electronic components. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales grew over 16% versus prior year with growth in all regions. While growth in this segment for the quarter was once again disproportionately impacted by component availability, we were able to mitigate these supply issues with the benefits from our resiliency actions. We see continued market need for our intelligent devices from PowerFlex drives to our motion technology to our best-in-class safety solutions. Our independent cart technology business had a record year with both orders and sales growing over 35% year-over-year. Software & Control organic sales growth of over 32% versus prior year was above expectations. Strong double-digit growth in View and Logix was driven by an improving component supply and our redesign investments. Lifecycle Services organic sales were up 16% year-over-year. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.02, very good for our fourth quarter. Information Solutions and Connected Services had another quarter of double-digit growth in both orders and sales. Here are a couple of wins in ISCS to highlight the continued value of our recent acquisitions and new releases in these areas. One of our Plex wins this quarter was with Futaba North America, a member of the Toyota business network. Futaba has selected Plex Smart Manufacturing platform for ERP, MES, quality management and production monitoring. Our state-of-the-art solution provides real-time inventory management complex planning and full visibility into this customer\u2019s manufacturing operations. Another example of how our new offerings are adding new value to our traditional customers is our win with Kraft Heinz this quarter. Our Plex platform, along with Kalypso\u2019s digital design and implementation services are helping Kraft meet its productivity, yield and quality goals. We also continue to broaden our customer base with our Fiix, cloud-native maintenance management system. In the quarter, Fiix was chosen by Barrett Steel, the UK\u2019s largest independent steel stockholder to help reduce their unplanned downtime with a solution that could be easily scaled across 28 sites. Connected Services sales were also strong in the quarter with double-digit growth in digital projects and cybersecurity services. In the quarter, ARR grew 14%, bringing our ARR to over 8% of total revenue. Segment margin of over 23% was up 540 basis points year-over-year, reflecting another quarter of strong execution. Adjusted EPS grew 30% year-over-year. Earlier this week, we completed the acquisition of the Danish company, CUBIC, a worldwide leader in modular systems for electrical panels. This acquisition will help expand the global REIT for our intelligent devices and will bring new customers and partners, including a broader market access in renewable energy and data centers. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q4 end market performance. All three industry segments grew double-digits this quarter driven by continued gradual improvement in the availability of electronic components. In our discrete industries, sales were up almost 20%. Within discrete, automotive sales were up 25% versus prior year. We had numerous wins this quarter with our customers continuing to invest in their global operations, whether it\u2019s starting up a new factory, securing their network infrastructure, or upgrading existing facilities with cloud-native software. One of our key EV wins this quarter was with Hyundai Motors for their U.S. greenfield mega site in Bryan County, Georgia. Hyundai Motors has selected Rockwell as their controls partner for press, body, paint and general assembly. Semiconductor sales grew 30% year-over-year with several global wins this quarter. In addition to securing a sizable turnkey project in Asia with our proven facilities monitoring system, we had an important win here in the U.S. to provide flexible wafer transfers as part of this customer\u2019s automated material handling system. Our Independent Cart Technology is being leveraged at scale to support this customer\u2019s labor productivity and capacity goals. In e-commerce and warehouse automation, our sales were up high-single digits in the quarter. Even with the slowdown in new e-commerce fulfillment center investment, retailers continue to adopt our solutions for greater warehouse efficiency and throughput. Moving to our hybrid industry segment. Sales in this segment grew over 20%, led by growth in food and beverage, life sciences and eco-industrial. Food and beverage sales were up 20% versus prior year. Similar to last quarter, we continue to see a good pipeline of greenfield and brownfield projects at our key customers. In the quarter, we won several multi-site deals with some of the largest food and beverage companies with a healthy mix of intelligent devices, software and digital consulting and implementation services. Life Sciences sales grew over 35% in the quarter with continued customer investments in software, cybersecurity and modular process control. Tire was up 20% versus prior year, led by growth at our end user customers. This is another vertical where we are seeing an increase in greenfield projects in all regions. Turning to process. This industry segment grew mid-teens versus prior year, with growth in metals, chemicals and oil and gas. One of the wins in chemicals this quarter was with Bora Lyondell Basell Petrochemical, the joint venture between Lyondell Basell and Bora Enterprise Group. The customer chose our advanced analytics solution to help improve product quality and increase production capacity at their new polymer production plant in China. Turning now to Slide 5 in our Q4 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales grew by 20% versus the prior year. Latin America sales were also up 20%, EMEA sales grew over 24%, and Asia-Pacific was up almost 18%. Let\u2019s move to Slide 6, an update to our orders and backlog performance this fiscal year. Order cancellations continue to stay within our historical low-single digit range. Our orders of over $10 billion and record backlog of over $5 billion this year set the stage for another year of strong sales growth in fiscal year 2023. As we turn to Slide 7, let\u2019s review highlights of fiscal 2022. We had another year of record orders with total orders of over $10 billion, growing 20% versus prior year. Reported and organic sales grew 11%, an impressive performance in light of all the challenges of the year. Information Solutions and Connected Services continue to meaningfully contribute to our growth with over $800 million in sales, growing double digits. ARR is also growing double digits and now accounts for more than 8% of our total revenue. Adjusted EPS was up 1% versus prior year. Excluding last year\u2019s one-time items, adjusted EPS was up 11%. Free cash flow conversion of 61% was driven by higher working capital. Nick will cover this in more detail later. The investments we\u2019ve made this year have strengthened the resiliency of our business model and position us for sustained growth in fiscal year 2023 and beyond. Let\u2019s now move to Slide 8, fiscal 2023 outlook. With the size of our record backlog, our outlook for fiscal 2023 is predicated on the availability of components. Given continued supply chain volatility, we think a conservative approach is appropriate. Our fiscal 2023 guidance projects total reported sales growth of 9.5%. Organic sales growth of 11% at the mid-point assumes continued supply chain stabilization with 4 points of growth coming from price and 7 points coming from volume. We expect acquisitions to contribute a point of profitable growth and currency to be a headwind of about 2.5 points. ARR is expected to have another year of double-digit growth. We are projecting segment margin to expand by 60 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow 12% versus prior year. And we target generation of over $1.1 billion of free cash flow next year with a return to a more normalized conversion of 95%. Let me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q4 performance and financial outlook for fiscal 2023. Nick?\nNick Gangestad: Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start on Slide 9, fourth quarter key financial information. Fourth quarter reported sales were up 17.6% over last year. Q4 organic sales were up 20.5% and acquisitions contributed 1.9 points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by 4.8 points. Segment operating margin expanded to 23.3% and was in line with our expectations. The 540 basis point increase was driven by higher sales and positive price costs, partially offset by the negative impact from currency. Corporate and other expense was $35 million and in line with the prior year. Adjusted EPS of $3.04 was in line with our guidance and grew 30% versus the prior year. I\u2019ll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 17.8%. The year-over-year increase was related to the cumulative impact of several onetime discrete items recognized in the prior year. Free cash flow was $359 million and was up $200 million over the prior year, driven by higher pretax income. Working capital on a currency-neutral basis grew 10% sequentially versus our plans for a 10% decline. Our planned inventory reductions did not materialize in the quarter due to the continued build of raw material and work in process waiting on critical components. The actions we put in place to rightsize inventory are taking longer to implement in the current supply chain environment. Our inventory days on hand at the end of the current year were close to 130 days versus a pre-pandemic average of 90 to 100 days. One additional item not shown on the slide. We repurchased approximately 300,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $76 million. For the full year, our share repurchases totaled $301 million, in line with our July guidance. On September 30, $1.3 billion remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 10 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Total and organic sales grew double digits across all three segments with software and control growing over 30% year-over-year. Backlog for all three segments grew sequentially and was up over 75% year-over-year. Segment margins for the Intelligent Devices segment expanded to 22.3% on higher sales and positive price/costs, partially offset by the negative impact from currency. Compared to last year, software and control margins were up over 10 percentage points driven by higher sales and positive price/cost, partially offset by negative currency impacts. Lifecycle Services segment margin was 10.7% and increased 260 basis points versus prior year, benefiting from higher sales. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.02. The next Slide 11 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q4 fiscal 2021 to Q4 fiscal 2022. Core performance was up $1.15 on a 20.5% organic sales increase. Approximately $0.10 were related to non-recurring accelerated investments that were made in the prior year. These investments were mostly in our Software & Control segment. The impact of currency was a $0.25 reduction in EPS, which was about $0.10 worse than our expectations, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar throughout the quarter. Incentive compensation was a $0.10 benefit. As previously noted, our higher adjusted effective tax rate was a $0.60 headwind due to prior year comps. Acquisitions, including the impact of interest added $0.15, primarily related to the prior year Plex deal fees. Our reduction in outstanding shares added about $0.05. Slide 12 provides a walk from our Q4 midpoint in our July guidance to our actual Q4 adjusted EPS results. Other than currency, sales and profits in the quarter played out in line with our guidance. Currency impact on sales was about $25 million worse than we expected and a $0.10 worse on EPS. The impact from currency on EPS was offset by a slightly lower incentive compensation and a more favorable adjusted tax rate. Strong organic sales growth and good execution delivered over 23% operating margin in the quarter. Slide 13 provides key financial information for the full year fiscal 2022. Reported sales grew 10.9% to $7.8 billion, including over 2 points coming from acquisitions. Currency negatively impacted sales by approximately $200 million or 2.7 points. Organic sales were up over 11% with growth bounced across all regions and business segments. Full year segment margin remained at about 20%. The benefit from higher volumes and lower incentive compensation was fully offset by higher wages and labor inefficiencies in our projects and in our plants caused by supply chain constraints. Margins were also negatively impacted by negative price costs, primarily in the first half of the year. We increased our growth investments by double digits this year with a big focus on key product launches, new digital capabilities, increased sales force investments and plant capacity expansion. Corporate and other was down $16 million, mostly related to acquisition costs associated with the Plex acquisition in the prior year. Adjusted EPS was up 1%. A detailed year-over-year adjusted EPS walk can be found in the appendix for your reference. Excluding the impact of the tax rate and the prior year onetime items, which included a favorable legal settlement and onetime accelerated investments, our adjusted EPS was up 11%. As discussed earlier, free cash flow performance was below our expectations with free cash flow conversion of 61%. The $460 million decrease in free cash flow was driven by a 50% increase in working capital on a currency-neutral basis as well as the payments of the fiscal year 2021 bonus in fiscal year 2022. There was no bonus payment made in fiscal year 2021. Working capital as a percent of sales was 16% compared to 12% a year earlier. Return on invested capital was 15.2% for fiscal year 2022 and 16 points worse than the prior year, primarily related to higher invested capital and lower pretax GAAP income driven by our mark-to-market adjustments made on our PTC investment in both years. For the year, we deployed about $900 million of capital towards dividends, share repurchases and inorganic investments in fiscal 2022. We also paid down debt by about $150 million. Our capital structure and liquidity remains strong. Before I cover fiscal year 2023 guidance, let\u2019s turn to Page 14. In fiscal year 2022, our backlog grew by over 75% year-over-year, including strong double-digit growth in each segment. Pre-pandemic, we had about one month or less of the following year\u2019s revenue in the backlog for Software & Control and Intelligent Devices. Our backlog now represents over 50% of our fiscal year 2023 sales guide for both of these segments. This unprecedented backlog coverage adds to our confidence in our revenue outlook. Our backlog also includes the benefits of price increases that were implemented throughout fiscal year 2022. Let\u2019s move on to the next Slide 15, guidance for fiscal year 2023. We are expecting sales of about $8.5 billion in fiscal 2023, up 9.5% at the midpoint of the range. We expect organic sales growth to be in a range of 9% to 13% and 11% at the midpoint of our range. This outlook includes our current backlog levels, our latest assumptions on supply chain stabilization as well as continued price growth momentum. We expect full year segment operating margins to be about 20.5%. At the midpoint, our guidance assumes full year core earnings conversion of between 30% and 35%. I\u2019ll cover a few more details on this on the next slide. We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate will be around 18%. We do not anticipate any material discrete items to impact our tax rate in fiscal 2023. Our adjusted EPS guidance is $10.20 to $11. This compares to fiscal 2022 adjusted EPS of $9.49. At the midpoint of the range, this represents 12% adjusted EPS growth. I will cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS walk on a later slide. We expect full year fiscal 2023 free cash flow conversion of about 95% of adjusted income. This reflects $190 million of capital expenditures. We are planning for a reduction in our working capital days with a focus on inventory days on hand. Our working capital is targeted to be about 15% of sales, still above our historic amount of around 12% as the return to pre-pandemic supplier lead times is slow. Finally, our projections include additional income tax payments of around $100 million related to the change in U.S. tax law that no longer allows for the immediate expensing of R&D. A few additional comments on fiscal 2023 guidance. Corporate and other expense is expected to be around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2023 is expected to be around $120 million. And finally, we\u2019re assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.1 million shares. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 16. Given the continued supply chain volatility and many moving pieces, we wanted to provide a slide that lays out the tailwinds and headwinds that are included in our fiscal year 2023 guidance. From a top line perspective, our 11% organic sales growth is supported by our higher backlog. This includes about 7% from higher volumes due to general supply chain stabilization, low cancellation rates and resiliency benefits coming from our redesign efforts done in fiscal 2022 and continuing in fiscal 2023. About 4% is coming from price growth, mostly tied to price actions that went into effect in fiscal 2022. We also have factored in about 1% inorganic growth for our recently completed acquisition of CUBIC. While the supply chain shows some signs of stabilization in Q4, there continues to be volatility along with a dynamic macroeconomic environment including the unfavorable impact of currency. All of these factors have informed our sales guidance and range. On adjusted EPS, we expect margin expansion from increased volume and positive price growth. The net favorable impact of price/cost on margins is about 100 basis points. We also will benefit from a higher discount rate favorably impacting our pension expense and will see about a $0.15 benefit from share repurchases. We continue to make investments in attracting and retaining key talent as well as restoring our bonus payout back to 100%. Combined these two items are around a 150-basis point headwind to our margins. While we do expect a positive price/cost for the year, we are also factoring in continued inflation, primarily in electronic components. We expect our margins to be negatively impacted by unfavorable mix and currency. Combined these two items will be a negative impact of around 150 basis points. We are expecting an adjusted effective tax rate of 18% or about a $0.20 headwind. The next Slide 17 provides the adjusted EPS walk from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023 guidance at the midpoint for your reference and which I spoke to on the previous slide. From a calendarization viewpoint, we expect our second and third quarters to have the highest sales growth rates for the year with each up mid-to-high teens year-over-year. We expect Q1 and Q4 to be in the single-digit growth range. Following the first quarter, we expect sequential sales to improve over the balance of the year. We expect segment margins and adjusted EPS to decline year-over-year in Q1. We see segment margins in the mid-teens for Q1 which is factored into our full year view of 20.5%. In Q1, we are projecting a year-over-year margin decrease from increases in spend, unfavorable mix, and currency, partially offset by positive price/cost. We are seeing margins improved sequentially following Q1 driven by higher volumes and continued positive price/cost. Moving on to the next Slide 18. I\u2019ll make a few comments on our capital deployment framework. Our long-term capital deployment priorities remain the same. Our first priority is organic growth. After that, we focus capital deployment on inorganic activities. Then we focus on capital returns to shareowners, through our dividend, and then share repurchases. In addition to our organic and inorganic investments, our capital deployment plans for fiscal 2023 include a focus on de-levering, dividends of about $540 million, and share repurchases of between $200 million and $300 million. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Nick. As we look to 2023, we are confident in our ability to execute our strategy. Our record backlog, underlying customer demand, and a more resilient operating model set the stage for a year of double-digit sales and earnings growth. As you heard today, we are continuing to invest for our future, including investing in attracting and retaining key talent. I would like to thank our people for their relentless commitment to solving the immediate needs of our customers while focusing on continued innovation and investment for the future. We are excited to share some of these innovations with you at our Investor Day in Chicago during Automation Fair later this month. We will be introducing an industry-first, cloud-native programming application for Logix, a new operator interface package, new I/O for process industries, on-machine motor control, and a host of other differentiated offerings that make this time a historic moment in Rockwell\u2019s journey. Aijana will now begin the Q&A session.\nAijana Zellner: We would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow up. Thank you. Julianne, let\u2019s take our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nScott Davis: Hey, good morning, guys, Blake, Nick, Aijana.\nBlake Moret: Hey, good morning.\nAijana Zellner: Good morning.\nScott Davis: Thanks for the detail. But can you give us a sense of inflection points and end markets, things that you\u2019re expecting to get perhaps meaningfully better or meaningfully worse in your 2023 guide?\nBlake Moret: So Scott, just working through the different industry segments, we talk about continued investment within the discrete industry segment in EV and battery. I mentioned the Hyundai wind, great wind force for with the greenfield, and we continue to see both the established brand owners as well as the startups increase capacity in their EV fleets because they have to, otherwise they\u2019re going to lose share and they\u2019re not going to be ready to meet growing consumer demand there. So we see that continuing. We continue to see a semiconductor moving forward. And even with a decrease in demand in the consumer markets, the trends remain that people are going to try to make every product that they produce smarter and there\u2019s going to continue to be growth in semiconductor, in consumer and certainly in the industrial markets that we participate in and automotive and so on. So we see continued investment there. And as we talked about a little bit, we\u2019re playing an expanded role in semiconductor production most specifically referenced by that material handling that way for handling wind that we talked about on the call. We see warehouse automation continuing. I don\u2019t see an immediate reacceleration in e-commerce, but for retailers wanting to be more efficient in back of store and in their own warehouses, we continue to see good business there going forward into fiscal 2023. In the Hybrid Industry segment, food and beverage continues a lot of that activity apart from a few of the green fields that we\u2019re participating in is actually productivity and resilience plays within existing facilities. So this is one of the best areas for our cyber security offerings. The services that we\u2019re providing in assessing and remediating and monitoring these facilities is particularly attractive to a lot of these food and beverage and consumer packaged goods companies. Pharmaceuticals, we continue to see the trends towards personalized medicine continuing on and within the Hybrid Industry segment, eco industrial with renewables and energy management water treatment that continues to be strong I think with good secular tailwinds. And then in process oil and gas, we continue to see double-digit growth ahead for the Sensia joint venture. Obviously, there\u2019s a lot of interest in the U.S. expanding our ability to provide energy both for our own domestic needs as well as potentially more export and along with traditional fossil fuels and helping them with their energy transition plans. And all of them of course have those plans. Renewables as well, and we\u2019ve talked before about customers like for solar that are continuing to build out their capabilities in renewables, and we\u2019re playing a strong role in that. So when we look at these verticals, we continue to see strength even in the face of what are certainly some macroeconomic headwinds.\nScott Davis: Good answer, Blake, or good thorough answer. When you get into the detail of auto. When you think about the spend \u2013 higher spend in EV and batteries, is there a certain negative offset in ice [ph] or is there some pent-up demand? I suppose just from the COVID lockdowns and such in that part of the world where there still needs to be some money spent, some color there would be helpful. Thanks.\nBlake Moret: Yes, Scott, I think the brand owners are going to continue to focus on their profit makers, right? They\u2019ve got their own sources of profit that are funding these new ventures. And so when you think of the trucks and the bigger vehicles, the luxury vehicles that are providing an outsized percentage of the profit, they\u2019re going to be working to keep those areas strong through this. They\u2019re probably going to be very judicious when it comes to model changeovers and things like that, but in terms of keeping those plants up and running that\u2019s a good read for us with all the installed base that we have.\nScott Davis: Okay. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you and best of luck.\nBlake Moret: Yes. Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrew Obin: Hi. Can you hear me?\nBlake Moret: We can.\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Excellent. Just, can you just talk about maybe any one time items that you got to ship a third quarter that you\u2019re not getting to ship in the first quarter? Other than normal seasonality, a price cost, but any specific market or geography that was particularly strong in the quarter, that sort of leading to very conservative forecast on mix and revenue in Q1? Thank you.\nNick Gangestad: Yes, the biggest swing we\u2019re going to see Andrew is in our Software & Control segment. Our fourth quarter, we saw good availability of components that we\u2019re benefiting our results in the fourth quarter. As we work with our suppliers there, we are seeing a decline in our Software & Control in the first quarter as we work specific \u2013 there\u2019s specific components that we \u2013 that will be during part of the first quarter that will be an even shorter supply. And that\u2019s part of what we\u2019re causing \u2013 what we\u2019re guiding in our statements about first quarter. This is really coming from our increase \u2013 as you can imagine, Andrew, throughout the year, it become even tighter engaged with our component suppliers to make sure we are making the right plans and making the right promises to our customers. And with this, we could see that there\u2019s a couple components that are going to be impacting us in partway through first quarter.\nBlake Moret: Yes. Nick, just to add to that, Andrew, the granularity of our analysis and out of our key suppliers, I should add continues to improve. And we think that had a bearing on Q3 and Q4 coming in as we expected in terms of the component supply. Working with these suppliers, we did identify a constraint in chip supply that will disproportionately affect offering control for a portion of Q1. The suppliers that we\u2019re working with have a high say/do ratio. They have characterized the issue. We understand it. We\u2019re working closely with them. But that\u2019s embedded in the Q1 implied guide.\nAndrew Obin: Got you. And just to understand in terms of your backlog and as you look into 2023, what percent of your revenue is underwritten at this point by the existing backlog? And how does it compare to sort of a normal year end? Thanks so much.\nBlake Moret: Yes. So, Nick will add some additional details to this. But we have about 60% of the full year in backlog. Typically, we have about a month. Most of our products are delivered off of a distributor shelf or very quickly from one of our factories either drop ship or through the distributor. And so having well over half the year of our shipments in the guidance in backlog is absolutely unprecedented. And you see the slide that we posted to kind of show the development of that across all three of our business segments.\nAndrew Obin: Right. Sorry, Nick. Yes?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Andrew, I don\u2019t really have anything to add to that, that those comments about less than a month and greater than half a year, that\u2019s really focused on our Software & Control and Intelligent Devices. I would call our Lifecycle Services a more normal. It\u2019s slightly elevated backlog, but that\u2019s a more normal type backlog. It\u2019s the other two segments that have the extended amounts of backlog.\nAndrew Obin: So it\u2019s just a real ability to ship as the gating factor.\nNick Gangestad: That is correct.\nAndrew Obin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: Hey, thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nBlake Moret: Hey, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Hey, I just wanted to try to deconstruct the grid \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, the bridge a little bit more if we could. In particular, just thinking about price cost, right, I think you talked about a 100 basis point tailwind there. And Nick, I guess the math that I\u2019m doing here is 4% price is kind of like over $300 million, right. So that\u2019s like $2 a share. So to get price/cost down to, call it, roughly $1 that we\u2019d be talking about cost being about half of what price is. So that gets me to like $150 million benefit on price/cost or maybe 200 basis points. I don\u2019t know if you agree with that math, but I just love some more color on what\u2019s going on in price/cost and mix and just how to really frame that number up a little bit more precisely.\nNick Gangestad: Yes. Most of your math make sense and aligns with how we\u2019re thinking about it. We are expecting input cost inflation to continue in 2023, and that\u2019s reflected. And again, about half of what we\u2019re seeing at price, that\u2019s accurate REIT that you\u2019re making, Jeff. As far as the \u2013 where that inflation that we\u2019re expecting, we\u2019re expecting all or virtually all of it in electronic components, where we\u2019ve been seeing that continue to go up, and we\u2019re projecting that to continue to go up in fiscal year 2023. Things like logistics, we\u2019ve seen some benefits more recently but we\u2019re calling that closer to flat for next year because while we\u2019re seeing some rate decreases, we\u2019re also anticipating some extra fuel costs that will largely offset that on the logistics side. So in terms of the math on it, I think the only thing I\u2019d point out is that price not only affects the numerator in that equation. It also affects the denominator as well. So adjusting both your \u2013 the income benefit but also the impact it has on revenue. That\u2019s what I \u2013 that\u2019s where I get to the 100 basis point impact on margin.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thanks for that. And then just a little bit more on Q1, pretty clear on the answer to Andrew\u2019s question about supply availability but maybe just give us a little color on the cadence of investment spending. It always seems to be a bit of a parlor game every year figuring out how that\u2019s progressing over the year. It sounds like it\u2019s heavier in Q1 and then tapers off, but can you give us a little bit more color on how to think about that.\nNick Gangestad: No. Our investment spend now \u2013 and you got to realize, Jeff, this is coming off a year where we increased our investment spend by 10% or a little over that. And now we\u2019re planning in our plans this year about a 5% increase on top of that. So that brings us to the cadence throughout the year. I don\u2019t see any big significant change in the cadence. When I was talking about the movement of spend, that\u2019s really more a statement on Q1 of last year to Q1 of fiscal year 2023 that will be going up. Sequentially from Q4 to Q1, I don\u2019t see our investment spend changing very much. That will stay at a pretty consistent level.\nJeff Sprague: Great, thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning.\nBlake Moret: Hi, Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: I guess, first question on backlog conversion. You sort of touched on a little bit of it, but any sort of explicit view on whether or not you guys will be working down backlog or any view on how order rates kind of progress throughout the year like is that something that you\u2019re planning on dipping into as part of that volume growth? Or is the expectation \u2013 that order rates kind of stay in the ZIP code and you kind of end up kind of flattish on the backlog situation. I know it\u2019s not normal guidance item, but we\u2019re kind of at an unusual point in time.\nBlake Moret: Yes, for sure. Let me just start by saying even with orders and shipments converging a bit in Q4, we still built backlog in Q4. And so we continue to expect significant backlog as we exit fiscal year 2023. We\u2019re going to continue to provide orders information through the year. We think it\u2019s an important point. But as we\u2019ve been saying and as we\u2019re now seeing as lead times in certain areas become \u2013 start coming down and our levels of customer service are increasing, we\u2019ll see those orders and those shipments converge, but they remained well above pre-pandemic order rates. Nick?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. I don\u2019t think I have much to add to what Blake said there. We \u2013 I think, particularly in the second half of the year, if we started to see some reduction in the backlog driven by reductions in our lead times, we would see that as healthy.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just on the incremental margins. I think longer term targeting something a little bit higher and sort of a reference point last year. Do you expect those to accelerate? I guess, sort of the input cost environment and some of the 1Q noise around supply chain. But on the investment side, I guess, what changed or what are you guys seeing to accelerate that a little further here? Like is there a specific market or channel shortfall? Or what exactly should we kind of anchor to as the driver of maybe that slightly higher number?\nNick Gangestad: The 5% increase that we\u2019re talking about in fiscal 2023, I just want to make sure I\u2019m answering the right question.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Yes. Or I guess more broadly, what\u2019s driving the incrementals apart from the things that are kind of beyond your control?\nNick Gangestad: Well, first, on the investment spend, that\u2019s \u2013 that I would put in a very normal range of growth for us from a historic perspective. And it\u2019s the typical things that we\u2019ve been investing in. We\u2019re investing in product development. We\u2019re investing in our SaaS capabilities, some of our enterprise digitization. We continue to invest in our sales force and as well as we\u2019ve been doing some investment in plant capacity expansion and we see that continuing to go. We\u2019re also investing in our own talent and the compensation that we are providing for the talent. That\u2019s all part of that roughly 5% increase in 2023. Now one of the big things we have \u2013 I said earlier that we have a core conversion that in the 30% to 35% range, that\u2019s in line with our financial framework that we\u2019ve laid out. One of the bigger moving items in that is just the restoration of our bonus that, that we had a noticeably less-than-planned bonus in fiscal year 2022. In this guide, we\u2019re planning for that to go back to our 100% level. And our core conversion if we were to normalize for that would be at 40%.\nBlake Moret: Yes. Just to add a little bit more. I touched on some of the new product introductions that we\u2019re going to be bringing out and that really are creating new streams of value for customers and investors for that matter. At Automation Fair, we\u2019re going to be introducing a cloud-native programming package for Logic. This is going to be an industry first for a major programmable controller line. It\u2019s a big deal. It went general availability, it went GA a few days ago. And this is the start of a whole new level of value for our customers for many, many years to come. A new operator interface package that came to us began really with our acquisition of ASEM, it was an extra benefit in addition to the hardware that we have from ASEM. That\u2019s going to be at Automation Fair. A brand-new line of process IO, specifically for process industries, a major step in the areas that we\u2019ve been talking about for a while now to add new process functionality to Logix control systems. On machine motion control with kinetics and PowerFlex, so these are things that customers have been asking for, for years. And we\u2019re coming out now with these items and at the beginning of these new revenue streams. In areas like cloud native software, one of the most important things you get is continued innovation and releases to the market. With on-prem software, you\u2019re often bound by annual or semiannual releases. And while we\u2019ll continue to do that with our strong on-prem offering, continuing to innovate at a faster pace with these new cloud-native offerings is a whole new source value for us. And so some of that is embedded with those investment spending increases, along with the go-to-market to make sure that we\u2019re getting the word out, and we\u2019re in front of the customers we need to be.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, Good morning. And I just wanted to circle back maybe just some of the comments on the first fiscal quarter. So I think you talked about 15% segment margins down from, I guess, 23% sequentially in Q4. And you mentioned mix a couple of times. So is the point there that the Software & Control margins are down very heavily versus that kind of 8-point firm-wide average. And then are we right in thinking it\u2019s around sort of $1.80, $1.90 of EPS in fiscal Q1? There\u2019s nothing odd happening below the line or anything like that? Just wanted to clarify that a little bit on mix and the EPS.\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Julian. The biggest thing I\u2019m talking about when I talk about mix is exactly what you referenced of our Software & Control. It was a noticeable help to us in Q4 with the 30%-plus growth there, and it will become a headwind to us in the first quarter because we expect it to be growing below the rest of the company average. So that swing there will be part of what\u2019s happening. In terms of other things, like things with corporate, other, with tax rate, I don\u2019t see anything out of the norm impacting us in Q1 disproportionately one way or the other versus the full year.\nJulian Mitchell: Got it. So that sort of $1.80, $1.90 isn\u2019t a bad sort of starting point, if you\u2019re down from the $2.10 a year ago of EPS.\nNick Gangestad: Julian, you\u2019re asking me to start to guide quarterly EPS guidance. I\u2019m trying to give as much color as I can, but I haven\u2019t pegged a exact range for EPS for Q1. We tend to guide for the full year what we expect for EPS.\nJulian Mitchell: Understood. And then just \u2013 thank you, Nick. Just my quick follow-up would be around the order intake. I think Blake, you made some very positive comments around the overall environment. I guess ABB had talked about kind of a normalization of discrete automation orders by their customers as supply chains are easing and maybe slightly extended kind of times for the customers to place orders because of the macro. So kind of two different drivers maybe weighing on orders a little bit. I just wondered if Rockwell had seen either of those points affecting the order intake at all.\nBlake Moret: Yes. I think in the first, with \u2013 as lead times come in a bit, and we\u2019re seeing that with certain of our product lines, you need less coverage, particularly if you\u2019re a machine builder, you don\u2019t need as many months of coverage of the products to complete your equipment. And so that\u2019s going to reduce the size and maybe the frequency of those orders. And I think that is a positive trend because it means customer service is coming back to where we expected to be. And graphically, you see a bit of that on some of the charts that we showed. In terms of customers with your second point, customers saying, no, we don\u2019t really need it now, not seeing much of that. I can tell you that the calls I\u2019m having with customers frequently are that they want their stuff. And so we\u2019re not seeing much at all in the way of customers saying, ship it when you can. That stuff I ordered a few weeks ago. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not getting those calls. So that would be my characterization of what we\u2019re seeing.\nQ - Julian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nNick Gangestad: Yes. Thanks, Julian.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brendan Luecke from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrendan Luecke: Good morning, all. Thanks for taking my questions.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning.\nBrendan Luecke: So I just wanted to double click on the cancellation trends. They\u2019ve ticked up a little bit over the last couple of quarters. I guess two questions here. One, is there a root cause? Or is this just noise in the numbers? And then two, just a point of clarification. The 1%, 2%, 3%, are these quarterly cancellation rates? Or is that an annualized rate?\nBlake Moret: Yes, those are quarterly rates and I\u2019d put them more in the noise category. I mean, these are rates that are low single digits and they\u2019re well within the range of what we\u2019ve seen historically.\nBrendan Luecke: Okay. Excellent. Thank you.\nBlake Moret: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nBlake Moret: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: On the end markets, can you give us a little bit of color around very strong sales growth orders a bit less of growth. Maybe just give us a little bit of color on the orders to the extent, you know, were there any end markets that were actually down? Or are they all up on orders?\nBlake Moret: Yes. So we don\u2019t provide specific information on incoming orders by industry. But based on the line of sight that we have with customers in these areas where we\u2019re working specifically with them on projects, whether it\u2019s in pharmaceutical for getting new medicines to market or it\u2019s new plants for EV like the Hyundai win or oil and gas wins that we see through Sensia. We\u2019ve got pretty good line of sight to that incoming activity, and it remains robust. I mean, again, while the order rates have moderated a bit, they\u2019re still well above pre-pandemic levels in the verticals that I talked about during my tour in answer to Scott\u2019s question.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. And then just on this \u2013 on the S&C margin, it\u2019s just a little bit like more lumpy than what we\u2019ve heard from others. Is there anything in the rev rec, revenue recognition around the software businesses that\u2019s kind of moving these margins around at all that we have to consider for a business like this going forward that may have an influence on 4Q to 1Q, it\u2019s just the seasonality here for that business? And also, why wouldn\u2019t these supply constraints impact intelligent devices more if they were kind of based on more of the products?\nBlake Moret: Sure. Let me start with that and then Nick may have additional comment. The Software & Control story is really around reduced volume. There\u2019s nothing in there with software rev rec, Plex continues to perform well. We didn\u2019t talk as much about it on the call, but we\u2019re very happy with the development of Plex, with the strategic value, the industrial logic as well as the financial performance of Plex, and we will talk more about that during Investor Day in a few weeks. So there\u2019s nothing there that\u2019s causing margins to be affected. It\u2019s more about the volume. And the issue that I talked a little bit about is with a specific components that are disproportionately used in Software & Control, there\u2019s a reduced supply for a portion of Q1 that picks back up. And so really, that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re giving a little bit more insight there. But that\u2019s what\u2019s causing the reduction after an over 30% year-over-year growth rate in the fourth quarter with Software & Control. And as we\u2019ve talked about often, all of our products are very highly impacted, positively by increasing growth. We saw that manifested in Q4 with Software & Control, and we\u2019re seeing that moderate in Q1 and then with sequential growth from there through the balance of the year.\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Steve, one way, we are still seeing, from a macro standpoint, general stabilization occurring from a supply chain perspective. What I\u2019m pointing out what we\u2019re seeing with Software & Control is some particular isolated incidences where we have this visibility of what\u2019s coming at us during the current quarter, and we just wanted to highlight that to you. It\u2019s not a general trend. It\u2019s something very specific and very short term.\nSteve Tusa: Right. But not software, not related to software rev rec? Yes. Okay. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone.\nBlake Moret: Hey, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Blake, there\u2019s obviously concern out there regarding a slower global economy, but your orders, as you\u2019ve talked about have remained strong. Can you give more color into what your customers are telling you about their CapEx plans? We\u2019ve already talked about some of your more cyclical end markets outperforming the semis and autos. But how much do you think reshoring is helping you at this point? And where do you think we are and let\u2019s call it the reshowing cycle, if you may?\nBlake Moret: Yes. I like talking about shoring rather than reshoring because it\u2019s really more about the U.S. being an outsized beneficiary of new CapEx as opposed to shuttering plants in China and other parts of Asia and bringing it back to the U.S. It\u2019s really about new lines of business, new capacity, filling out a little more of a local-for-local strategy, got a lot of manufacturers are providing, and I don\u2019t see anything with the current economic headwinds that would cause people to say just kidding. Let\u2019s go back to pushing manufacturing to other parts of the world and chase lower labor rates. I see, if anything, the U.S. continuing to be a beneficiary as people are trying to add redundant lines as people are trying to get closer to their consumers so that they\u2019re not having to rely on 10,000-mile supply chains. We\u2019re going to continue. And one of the things I look at is our own plans as a manufacturer. What is Rockwell doing? And we look at our CapEx that Nick talked about, which is up year-over-year for things that we feel like we need to do for the near-term in office to sustain share gains going forward and the continued investment in the U.S. We have a very important manufacturing that we\u2019re going to continue in the U.S. because it\u2019s our biggest market. And we continue to support manufacturing close to consumer here just as we do in Europe and in Asia and in Latin America.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Very helpful, Blake. And then can you give us a little more color to what you\u2019re seeing in process automation markets? It seems like you\u2019re forecasting a bit of an uptick in mining related growth for 2023? You\u2019re still forecasting double-digit chemicals-related growth despite chemical-related companies having more difficult time lately. So what are your customers telling you there? And then given the later cycle nature of Lifecycle solutions, should we expect a bigger margin tick up in that business in 2023 versus the other segments?\nBlake Moret: So process, we\u2019re expecting good things in fiscal year 2023. And this is an area where even apart from the recent activity, the recent dynamics backlog is very meaningful. And so when we look at backlog, for instance, in Sensia, it\u2019s very strong. It\u2019s an even higher number in terms of the percentage of revenue that\u2019s in backlog for fiscal 2023 than the Rockwell company average. And that\u2019s typical because it\u2019s engineered solutions that take longer to plan and stage and design, commission and so on. So we see that as a good read for oil and gas. There\u2019s activity in mining, and we\u2019ve had some decent wins. I wouldn\u2019t call mining back at a torrid pace there. Metal is pretty good. And we don\u2019t talk as much about metals, but metals continues to be a big automation market and especially with the release of some of the new high-performance drives, we\u2019ve got better capacity, better capabilities than we\u2019ve had in years for addressing that market. There\u2019s still some activity in forest products and chemicals, and we talked about the win with Bora LyondellBasell, where our offerings, our continued enhancement of offerings with Logix Space control systems is going to help us in chemical, the new IO that we\u2019re going to be introducing an automation fair is going to be a major step for chemical as well. So those are some of the things going on there. And then in life science, as you mentioned that, really strong growth in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve talked about how life sciences is not as affected by the component shortages because so much of our business in life sciences is actually based on software and high-value services. And from a macro standpoint, people want to live longer, healthier lives and personalized medicine is a way to help that objective, and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re particularly strong in.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Appreciate the color.\nAijana Zellner: Julianne, we will take one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Phil Buller from Berenberg. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPhil Buller: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. I\u2019m keen to hear what level of safety buffer you\u2019ve baked into this organic growth guide for the year. There was a bit of an overshoot this time last year. I appreciate that there\u2019s 60% of the year already in the backlog, but I guess I\u2019m surprised to see an 11% midpoint given the macro. So anything you can share in terms of overall confidence levels or safety buffer would be great and where that might reside be that on the top line assumptions or perhaps it\u2019s more in the margin side, which collectively give you the right confidence levels for the earnings for the year.\nBlake Moret: Sure. Well, let me start by saying that the overarching driver is what we have in backlog, over $5 billion in backlog is unprecedented. And with continued strong order entry and with continued very low cancellation rates, that\u2019s the primary story. Now in terms of the tone, I did mention during my prepared remarks that we feel like a conservative approach is appropriate. I\u2019m not going to dimension that or quantify that, but that was a deliberate comment in the prepared remarks.\nPhil Buller: Got it. Thanks. And just as a bit of a follow-up or a slight adjacency really is the company\u2019s appetite for M&A at this point, be that large or small, I\u2019m thinking more in the context of peers. We\u2019ve now got Emerson, who are going to have a lot of firepower. Schneider, who are looking to acquire the rest of Aviva. So does M&A need to move higher on Rockwell\u2019s agenda from a competitive dynamics standpoint? Or has your thinking evolved in terms of the need to participate more strongly in M&A? Thanks.\nBlake Moret: Well, we\u2019re very happy at the increased participation in M&A that we\u2019ve demonstrated over the last few years and more importantly, the way that it\u2019s helped add new value for customers as well as investors. And we\u2019ll go into this in a little more detail in a couple of weeks at Investor Day. But first, looking at the strategic fit with some well-defined priorities that we\u2019ve talked about and then the financial framework. We\u2019re very happy with the way that our M&A that we\u2019ve already completed, most recently with the CUBIC acquisition and that we have in the funnel will continue to strengthen us as a pure-play automation provider. It\u2019s one of our strengths, and the market access that we have to provide new value from M&A immediately into all of the industry segments of discrete and hybrid and process is second to none. So I\u2019m happy with the way that we\u2019re positioned with M&A. We\u2019re going to keep doing it. We have a strong balance sheet, and we\u2019ve got a great track record of turning these acquisitions into real value.\nPhil Buller: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: We are out of time for questions today. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Ms. Zellner for closing remarks.\nAijana Zellner: Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. At this time, you may disconnect. Thank you.",

            "content": "Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 9, fourth quarter key financial information. Fourth quarter reported sales were up 17.6% over last year. Q4 organic sales were up 20.5% and acquisitions contributed 1.9 points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by 4.8 points. Segment operating margin expanded to 23.3% and was in line with our expectations. The 540 basis point increase was driven by higher sales and positive price costs, partially offset by the negative impact from currency. Corporate and other expense was $35 million and in line with the prior year. Adjusted EPS of $3.04 was in line with our guidance and grew 30% versus the prior year. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 17.8%. The year-over-year increase was related to the cumulative impact of several onetime discrete items recognized in the prior year. Free cash flow was $359 million and was up $200 million over the prior year, driven by higher pretax income. Working capital on a currency-neutral basis grew 10% sequentially versus our plans for a 10% decline. Our planned inventory reductions did not materialize in the quarter due to the continued build of raw material and work in process waiting on critical components. The actions we put in place to rightsize inventory are taking longer to implement in the current supply chain environment. Our inventory days on hand at the end of the current year were close to 130 days versus a pre-pandemic average of 90 to 100 days. One additional item not shown on the slide. We repurchased approximately 300,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $76 million. For the full year, our share repurchases totaled $301 million, in line with our July guidance. On September 30, $1.3 billion remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 10 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Total and organic sales grew double digits across all three segments with software and control growing over 30% year-over-year. Backlog for all three segments grew sequentially and was up over 75% year-over-year. Segment margins for the Intelligent Devices segment expanded to 22.3% on higher sales and positive price/costs, partially offset by the negative impact from currency. Compared to last year, software and control margins were up over 10 percentage points driven by higher sales and positive price/cost, partially offset by negative currency impacts. Lifecycle Services segment margin was 10.7% and increased 260 basis points versus prior year, benefiting from higher sales. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.02. The next Slide 11 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q4 fiscal 2021 to Q4 fiscal 2022. Core performance was up $1.15 on a 20.5% organic sales increase. Approximately $0.10 were related to non-recurring accelerated investments that were made in the prior year. These investments were mostly in our Software & Control segment. The impact of currency was a $0.25 reduction in EPS, which was about $0.10 worse than our expectations, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar throughout the quarter. Incentive compensation was a $0.10 benefit. As previously noted, our higher adjusted effective tax rate was a $0.60 headwind due to prior year comps. Acquisitions, including the impact of interest added $0.15, primarily related to the prior year Plex deal fees. Our reduction in outstanding shares added about $0.05. Slide 12 provides a walk from our Q4 midpoint in our July guidance to our actual Q4 adjusted EPS results. Other than currency, sales and profits in the quarter played out in line with our guidance. Currency impact on sales was about $25 million worse than we expected and a $0.10 worse on EPS. The impact from currency on EPS was offset by a slightly lower incentive compensation and a more favorable adjusted tax rate. Strong organic sales growth and good execution delivered over 23% operating margin in the quarter. Slide 13 provides key financial information for the full year fiscal 2022. Reported sales grew 10.9% to $7.8 billion, including over 2 points coming from acquisitions. Currency negatively impacted sales by approximately $200 million or 2.7 points. Organic sales were up over 11% with growth bounced across all regions and business segments. Full year segment margin remained at about 20%. The benefit from higher volumes and lower incentive compensation was fully offset by higher wages and labor inefficiencies in our projects and in our plants caused by supply chain constraints. Margins were also negatively impacted by negative price costs, primarily in the first half of the year. We increased our growth investments by double digits this year with a big focus on key product launches, new digital capabilities, increased sales force investments and plant capacity expansion. Corporate and other was down $16 million, mostly related to acquisition costs associated with the Plex acquisition in the prior year. Adjusted EPS was up 1%. A detailed year-over-year adjusted EPS walk can be found in the appendix for your reference. Excluding the impact of the tax rate and the prior year onetime items, which included a favorable legal settlement and onetime accelerated investments, our adjusted EPS was up 11%. As discussed earlier, free cash flow performance was below our expectations with free cash flow conversion of 61%. The $460 million decrease in free cash flow was driven by a 50% increase in working capital on a currency-neutral basis as well as the payments of the fiscal year 2021 bonus in fiscal year 2022. There was no bonus payment made in fiscal year 2021. Working capital as a percent of sales was 16% compared to 12% a year earlier. Return on invested capital was 15.2% for fiscal year 2022 and 16 points worse than the prior year, primarily related to higher invested capital and lower pretax GAAP income driven by our mark-to-market adjustments made on our PTC investment in both years. For the year, we deployed about $900 million of capital towards dividends, share repurchases and inorganic investments in fiscal 2022. We also paid down debt by about $150 million. Our capital structure and liquidity remains strong. Before I cover fiscal year 2023 guidance, let's turn to Page 14. In fiscal year 2022, our backlog grew by over 75% year-over-year, including strong double-digit growth in each segment. Pre-pandemic, we had about one month or less of the following year's revenue in the backlog for Software & Control and Intelligent Devices. Our backlog now represents over 50% of our fiscal year 2023 sales guide for both of these segments. This unprecedented backlog coverage adds to our confidence in our revenue outlook. Our backlog also includes the benefits of price increases that were implemented throughout fiscal year 2022. Let's move on to the next Slide 15, guidance for fiscal year 2023. We are expecting sales of about $8.5 billion in fiscal 2023, up 9.5% at the midpoint of the range. We expect organic sales growth to be in a range of 9% to 13% and 11% at the midpoint of our range. This outlook includes our current backlog levels, our latest assumptions on supply chain stabilization as well as continued price growth momentum. We expect full year segment operating margins to be about 20.5%. At the midpoint, our guidance assumes full year core earnings conversion of between 30% and 35%. I'll cover a few more details on this on the next slide. We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate will be around 18%. We do not anticipate any material discrete items to impact our tax rate in fiscal 2023. Our adjusted EPS guidance is $10.20 to $11. This compares to fiscal 2022 adjusted EPS of $9.49. At the midpoint of the range, this represents 12% adjusted EPS growth. I will cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS walk on a later slide. We expect full year fiscal 2023 free cash flow conversion of about 95% of adjusted income. This reflects $190 million of capital expenditures. We are planning for a reduction in our working capital days with a focus on inventory days on hand. Our working capital is targeted to be about 15% of sales, still above our historic amount of around 12% as the return to pre-pandemic supplier lead times is slow. Finally, our projections include additional income tax payments of around $100 million related to the change in U.S. tax law that no longer allows for the immediate expensing of R&D. A few additional comments on fiscal 2023 guidance. Corporate and other expense is expected to be around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2023 is expected to be around $120 million. And finally, we're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.1 million shares. Let's turn to Slide 16. Given the continued supply chain volatility and many moving pieces, we wanted to provide a slide that lays out the tailwinds and headwinds that are included in our fiscal year 2023 guidance. From a top line perspective, our 11% organic sales growth is supported by our higher backlog. This includes about 7% from higher volumes due to general supply chain stabilization, low cancellation rates and resiliency benefits coming from our redesign efforts done in fiscal 2022 and continuing in fiscal 2023. About 4% is coming from price growth, mostly tied to price actions that went into effect in fiscal 2022. We also have factored in about 1% inorganic growth for our recently completed acquisition of CUBIC. While the supply chain shows some signs of stabilization in Q4, there continues to be volatility along with a dynamic macroeconomic environment including the unfavorable impact of currency. All of these factors have informed our sales guidance and range. On adjusted EPS, we expect margin expansion from increased volume and positive price growth. The net favorable impact of price/cost on margins is about 100 basis points. We also will benefit from a higher discount rate favorably impacting our pension expense and will see about a $0.15 benefit from share repurchases. We continue to make investments in attracting and retaining key talent as well as restoring our bonus payout back to 100%. Combined these two items are around a 150-basis point headwind to our margins. While we do expect a positive price/cost for the year, we are also factoring in continued inflation, primarily in electronic components. We expect our margins to be negatively impacted by unfavorable mix and currency. Combined these two items will be a negative impact of around 150 basis points. We are expecting an adjusted effective tax rate of 18% or about a $0.20 headwind. The next Slide 17 provides the adjusted EPS walk from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023 guidance at the midpoint for your reference and which I spoke to on the previous slide. From a calendarization viewpoint, we expect our second and third quarters to have the highest sales growth rates for the year with each up mid-to-high teens year-over-year. We expect Q1 and Q4 to be in the single-digit growth range. Following the first quarter, we expect sequential sales to improve over the balance of the year. We expect segment margins and adjusted EPS to decline year-over-year in Q1. We see segment margins in the mid-teens for Q1 which is factored into our full year view of 20.5%. In Q1, we are projecting a year-over-year margin decrease from increases in spend, unfavorable mix, and currency, partially offset by positive price/cost. We are seeing margins improved sequentially following Q1 driven by higher volumes and continued positive price/cost. Moving on to the next Slide 18. I'll make a few comments on our capital deployment framework. Our long-term capital deployment priorities remain the same. Our first priority is organic growth. After that, we focus capital deployment on inorganic activities. Then we focus on capital returns to shareowners, through our dividend, and then share repurchases. In addition to our organic and inorganic investments, our capital deployment plans for fiscal 2023 include a focus on de-levering, dividends of about $540 million, and share repurchases of between $200 million and $300 million. With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Yes, Andrew. Yes, the biggest swing we're going to see Andrew is in our Software & Control segment. Our fourth quarter, we saw good availability of components that we're benefiting our results in the fourth quarter. As we work with our suppliers there, we are seeing a decline in our Software & Control in the first quarter as we work specific \u2013 there's specific components that we \u2013 that will be during part of the first quarter that will be an even shorter supply. And that's part of what we're causing \u2013 what we're guiding in our statements about first quarter. This is really coming from our increase \u2013 as you can imagine, Andrew, throughout the year, it become even tighter engaged with our component suppliers to make sure we are making the right plans and making the right promises to our customers. And with this, we could see that there's a couple components that are going to be impacting us in partway through first quarter. Yes, Andrew, I don't really have anything to add to that, that those comments about less than a month and greater than half a year, that's really focused on our Software & Control and Intelligent Devices. I would call our Lifecycle Services a more normal. It's slightly elevated backlog, but that's a more normal type backlog. It's the other two segments that have the extended amounts of backlog. That is correct. Yes. Most of your math make sense and aligns with how we're thinking about it. We are expecting input cost inflation to continue in 2023, and that's reflected. And again, about half of what we're seeing at price, that's accurate REIT that you're making, Jeff. As far as the \u2013 where that inflation that we're expecting, we're expecting all or virtually all of it in electronic components, where we've been seeing that continue to go up, and we're projecting that to continue to go up in fiscal year 2023. Things like logistics, we've seen some benefits more recently but we're calling that closer to flat for next year because while we're seeing some rate decreases, we're also anticipating some extra fuel costs that will largely offset that on the logistics side. So in terms of the math on it, I think the only thing I'd point out is that price not only affects the numerator in that equation. It also affects the denominator as well. So adjusting both your \u2013 the income benefit but also the impact it has on revenue. That's what I \u2013 that's where I get to the 100 basis point impact on margin. No. Our investment spend now \u2013 and you got to realize, Jeff, this is coming off a year where we increased our investment spend by 10% or a little over that. And now we're planning in our plans this year about a 5% increase on top of that. So that brings us to the cadence throughout the year. I don't see any big significant change in the cadence. When I was talking about the movement of spend, that's really more a statement on Q1 of last year to Q1 of fiscal year 2023 that will be going up. Sequentially from Q4 to Q1, I don't see our investment spend changing very much. That will stay at a pretty consistent level. Yes. I don't think I have much to add to what Blake said there. We \u2013 I think, particularly in the second half of the year, if we started to see some reduction in the backlog driven by reductions in our lead times, we would see that as healthy. The 5% increase that we're talking about in fiscal 2023, I just want to make sure I'm answering the right question. Well, first, on the investment spend, that's \u2013 that I would put in a very normal range of growth for us from a historic perspective. And it's the typical things that we've been investing in. We're investing in product development. We're investing in our SaaS capabilities, some of our enterprise digitization. We continue to invest in our sales force and as well as we've been doing some investment in plant capacity expansion and we see that continuing to go. We're also investing in our own talent and the compensation that we are providing for the talent. That's all part of that roughly 5% increase in 2023. Now one of the big things we have \u2013 I said earlier that we have a core conversion that in the 30% to 35% range, that's in line with our financial framework that we've laid out. One of the bigger moving items in that is just the restoration of our bonus that, that we had a noticeably less-than-planned bonus in fiscal year 2022. In this guide, we're planning for that to go back to our 100% level. And our core conversion if we were to normalize for that would be at 40%. Yes, Julian. The biggest thing I'm talking about when I talk about mix is exactly what you referenced of our Software & Control. It was a noticeable help to us in Q4 with the 30%-plus growth there, and it will become a headwind to us in the first quarter because we expect it to be growing below the rest of the company average. So that swing there will be part of what's happening. In terms of other things, like things with corporate, other, with tax rate, I don't see anything out of the norm impacting us in Q1 disproportionately one way or the other versus the full year. Julian, you're asking me to start to guide quarterly EPS guidance. I'm trying to give as much color as I can, but I haven't pegged a exact range for EPS for Q1. We tend to guide for the full year what we expect for EPS. Yes. Thanks, Julian. Good morning. Yes, Steve, one way, we are still seeing, from a macro standpoint, general stabilization occurring from a supply chain perspective. What I'm pointing out what we're seeing with Software & Control is some particular isolated incidences where we have this visibility of what's coming at us during the current quarter, and we just wanted to highlight that to you. It's not a general trend. It's something very specific and very short term."

            "content": "Thanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our fourth quarter results on Slide 3. We had a great finish to the fiscal year and delivered very strong operating performance. I'm proud of how our teams navigated this challenging year with continued supply chain volatility, significant inflation and currency headwinds. Our Q4 results were in line with our expectations with organic sales and earnings, both growing double-digits year-over-year and sequentially. Orders came in as expected in the quarter. Our record backlog, along with very low order cancellation rates reflect the continued solid underlying demand from our customers across many industries and regions. Total revenue of over $2.1 billion was up 17.6% year-over-year. Organic sales grew 20.5% versus prior year in line with our expectations. Acquisitions contributed almost two points of growth this quarter. Currency translation reduced sales by about 5%, driven by continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. As expected, we continue to see a gradual stabilization of global supply chain. Similar to last quarter, the split of Q4 shipments by business segment and region was driven by access to specific electronic components. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales grew over 16% versus prior year with growth in all regions. While growth in this segment for the quarter was once again disproportionately impacted by component availability, we were able to mitigate these supply issues with the benefits from our resiliency actions. We see continued market need for our intelligent devices from PowerFlex drives to our motion technology to our best-in-class safety solutions. Our independent cart technology business had a record year with both orders and sales growing over 35% year-over-year. Software & Control organic sales growth of over 32% versus prior year was above expectations. Strong double-digit growth in View and Logix was driven by an improving component supply and our redesign investments. Lifecycle Services organic sales were up 16% year-over-year. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.02, very good for our fourth quarter. Information Solutions and Connected Services had another quarter of double-digit growth in both orders and sales. Here are a couple of wins in ISCS to highlight the continued value of our recent acquisitions and new releases in these areas. One of our Plex wins this quarter was with Futaba North America, a member of the Toyota business network. Futaba has selected Plex Smart Manufacturing platform for ERP, MES, quality management and production monitoring. Our state-of-the-art solution provides real-time inventory management complex planning and full visibility into this customer's manufacturing operations. Another example of how our new offerings are adding new value to our traditional customers is our win with Kraft Heinz this quarter. Our Plex platform, along with Kalypso's digital design and implementation services are helping Kraft meet its productivity, yield and quality goals. We also continue to broaden our customer base with our Fiix, cloud-native maintenance management system. In the quarter, Fiix was chosen by Barrett Steel, the UK's largest independent steel stockholder to help reduce their unplanned downtime with a solution that could be easily scaled across 28 sites. Connected Services sales were also strong in the quarter with double-digit growth in digital projects and cybersecurity services. In the quarter, ARR grew 14%, bringing our ARR to over 8% of total revenue. Segment margin of over 23% was up 540 basis points year-over-year, reflecting another quarter of strong execution. Adjusted EPS grew 30% year-over-year. Earlier this week, we completed the acquisition of the Danish company, CUBIC, a worldwide leader in modular systems for electrical panels. This acquisition will help expand the global REIT for our intelligent devices and will bring new customers and partners, including a broader market access in renewable energy and data centers. Let's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q4 end market performance. All three industry segments grew double-digits this quarter driven by continued gradual improvement in the availability of electronic components. In our discrete industries, sales were up almost 20%. Within discrete, automotive sales were up 25% versus prior year. We had numerous wins this quarter with our customers continuing to invest in their global operations, whether it's starting up a new factory, securing their network infrastructure, or upgrading existing facilities with cloud-native software. One of our key EV wins this quarter was with Hyundai Motors for their U.S. greenfield mega site in Bryan County, Georgia. Hyundai Motors has selected Rockwell as their controls partner for press, body, paint and general assembly. Semiconductor sales grew 30% year-over-year with several global wins this quarter. In addition to securing a sizable turnkey project in Asia with our proven facilities monitoring system, we had an important win here in the U.S. to provide flexible wafer transfers as part of this customer's automated material handling system. Our Independent Cart Technology is being leveraged at scale to support this customer's labor productivity and capacity goals. In e-commerce and warehouse automation, our sales were up high-single digits in the quarter. Even with the slowdown in new e-commerce fulfillment center investment, retailers continue to adopt our solutions for greater warehouse efficiency and throughput. Moving to our hybrid industry segment. Sales in this segment grew over 20%, led by growth in food and beverage, life sciences and eco-industrial. Food and beverage sales were up 20% versus prior year. Similar to last quarter, we continue to see a good pipeline of greenfield and brownfield projects at our key customers. In the quarter, we won several multi-site deals with some of the largest food and beverage companies with a healthy mix of intelligent devices, software and digital consulting and implementation services. Life Sciences sales grew over 35% in the quarter with continued customer investments in software, cybersecurity and modular process control. Tire was up 20% versus prior year, led by growth at our end user customers. This is another vertical where we are seeing an increase in greenfield projects in all regions. Turning to process. This industry segment grew mid-teens versus prior year, with growth in metals, chemicals and oil and gas. One of the wins in chemicals this quarter was with Bora Lyondell Basell Petrochemical, the joint venture between Lyondell Basell and Bora Enterprise Group. The customer chose our advanced analytics solution to help improve product quality and increase production capacity at their new polymer production plant in China. Turning now to Slide 5 in our Q4 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales grew by 20% versus the prior year. Latin America sales were also up 20%, EMEA sales grew over 24%, and Asia-Pacific was up almost 18%. Let's move to Slide 6, an update to our orders and backlog performance this fiscal year. Order cancellations continue to stay within our historical low-single digit range. Our orders of over $10 billion and record backlog of over $5 billion this year set the stage for another year of strong sales growth in fiscal year 2023. As we turn to Slide 7, let's review highlights of fiscal 2022. We had another year of record orders with total orders of over $10 billion, growing 20% versus prior year. Reported and organic sales grew 11%, an impressive performance in light of all the challenges of the year. Information Solutions and Connected Services continue to meaningfully contribute to our growth with over $800 million in sales, growing double digits. ARR is also growing double digits and now accounts for more than 8% of our total revenue. Adjusted EPS was up 1% versus prior year. Excluding last year's one-time items, adjusted EPS was up 11%. Free cash flow conversion of 61% was driven by higher working capital. Nick will cover this in more detail later. The investments we've made this year have strengthened the resiliency of our business model and position us for sustained growth in fiscal year 2023 and beyond. Let's now move to Slide 8, fiscal 2023 outlook. With the size of our record backlog, our outlook for fiscal 2023 is predicated on the availability of components. Given continued supply chain volatility, we think a conservative approach is appropriate. Our fiscal 2023 guidance projects total reported sales growth of 9.5%. Organic sales growth of 11% at the mid-point assumes continued supply chain stabilization with 4 points of growth coming from price and 7 points coming from volume. We expect acquisitions to contribute a point of profitable growth and currency to be a headwind of about 2.5 points. ARR is expected to have another year of double-digit growth. We are projecting segment margin to expand by 60 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow 12% versus prior year. And we target generation of over $1.1 billion of free cash flow next year with a return to a more normalized conversion of 95%. Let me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q4 performance and financial outlook for fiscal 2023. Nick? Thanks, Nick. As we look to 2023, we are confident in our ability to execute our strategy. Our record backlog, underlying customer demand, and a more resilient operating model set the stage for a year of double-digit sales and earnings growth. As you heard today, we are continuing to invest for our future, including investing in attracting and retaining key talent. I would like to thank our people for their relentless commitment to solving the immediate needs of our customers while focusing on continued innovation and investment for the future. We are excited to share some of these innovations with you at our Investor Day in Chicago during Automation Fair later this month. We will be introducing an industry-first, cloud-native programming application for Logix, a new operator interface package, new I/O for process industries, on-machine motor control, and a host of other differentiated offerings that make this time a historic moment in Rockwell's journey. Aijana will now begin the Q&A session. Hey, good morning. So Scott, just working through the different industry segments, we talk about continued investment within the discrete industry segment in EV and battery. I mentioned the Hyundai wind, great wind force for with the greenfield, and we continue to see both the established brand owners as well as the startups increase capacity in their EV fleets because they have to, otherwise they're going to lose share and they're not going to be ready to meet growing consumer demand there. So we see that continuing. We continue to see a semiconductor moving forward. And even with a decrease in demand in the consumer markets, the trends remain that people are going to try to make every product that they produce smarter and there's going to continue to be growth in semiconductor, in consumer and certainly in the industrial markets that we participate in and automotive and so on. So we see continued investment there. And as we talked about a little bit, we're playing an expanded role in semiconductor production most specifically referenced by that material handling that way for handling wind that we talked about on the call. We see warehouse automation continuing. I don't see an immediate reacceleration in e-commerce, but for retailers wanting to be more efficient in back of store and in their own warehouses, we continue to see good business there going forward into fiscal 2023. In the Hybrid Industry segment, food and beverage continues a lot of that activity apart from a few of the green fields that we're participating in is actually productivity and resilience plays within existing facilities. So this is one of the best areas for our cyber security offerings. The services that we're providing in assessing and remediating and monitoring these facilities is particularly attractive to a lot of these food and beverage and consumer packaged goods companies. Pharmaceuticals, we continue to see the trends towards personalized medicine continuing on and within the Hybrid Industry segment, eco industrial with renewables and energy management water treatment that continues to be strong I think with good secular tailwinds. And then in process oil and gas, we continue to see double-digit growth ahead for the Sensia joint venture. Obviously, there's a lot of interest in the U.S. expanding our ability to provide energy both for our own domestic needs as well as potentially more export and along with traditional fossil fuels and helping them with their energy transition plans. And all of them of course have those plans. Renewables as well, and we've talked before about customers like for solar that are continuing to build out their capabilities in renewables, and we're playing a strong role in that. So when we look at these verticals, we continue to see strength even in the face of what are certainly some macroeconomic headwinds. Yes, Scott, I think the brand owners are going to continue to focus on their profit makers, right? They've got their own sources of profit that are funding these new ventures. And so when you think of the trucks and the bigger vehicles, the luxury vehicles that are providing an outsized percentage of the profit, they're going to be working to keep those areas strong through this. They're probably going to be very judicious when it comes to model changeovers and things like that, but in terms of keeping those plants up and running that's a good read for us with all the installed base that we have. Yes. Thanks, Scott. We can. Yes. Nick, just to add to that, Andrew, the granularity of our analysis and out of our key suppliers, I should add continues to improve. And we think that had a bearing on Q3 and Q4 coming in as we expected in terms of the component supply. Working with these suppliers, we did identify a constraint in chip supply that will disproportionately affect offering control for a portion of Q1. The suppliers that we're working with have a high say/do ratio. They have characterized the issue. We understand it. We're working closely with them. But that's embedded in the Q1 implied guide. Yes. So, Nick will add some additional details to this. But we have about 60% of the full year in backlog. Typically, we have about a month. Most of our products are delivered off of a distributor shelf or very quickly from one of our factories either drop ship or through the distributor. And so having well over half the year of our shipments in the guidance in backlog is absolutely unprecedented. And you see the slide that we posted to kind of show the development of that across all three of our business segments. Hey, Jeff. Hi, Josh. Yes, for sure. Let me just start by saying even with orders and shipments converging a bit in Q4, we still built backlog in Q4. And so we continue to expect significant backlog as we exit fiscal year 2023. We're going to continue to provide orders information through the year. We think it's an important point. But as we've been saying and as we're now seeing as lead times in certain areas become \u2013 start coming down and our levels of customer service are increasing, we'll see those orders and those shipments converge, but they remained well above pre-pandemic order rates. Nick? Yes. Just to add a little bit more. I touched on some of the new product introductions that we're going to be bringing out and that really are creating new streams of value for customers and investors for that matter. At Automation Fair, we're going to be introducing a cloud-native programming package for Logic. This is going to be an industry first for a major programmable controller line. It's a big deal. It went general availability, it went GA a few days ago. And this is the start of a whole new level of value for our customers for many, many years to come. A new operator interface package that came to us began really with our acquisition of ASEM, it was an extra benefit in addition to the hardware that we have from ASEM. That's going to be at Automation Fair. A brand-new line of process IO, specifically for process industries, a major step in the areas that we've been talking about for a while now to add new process functionality to Logix control systems. On machine motion control with kinetics and PowerFlex, so these are things that customers have been asking for, for years. And we're coming out now with these items and at the beginning of these new revenue streams. In areas like cloud native software, one of the most important things you get is continued innovation and releases to the market. With on-prem software, you're often bound by annual or semiannual releases. And while we'll continue to do that with our strong on-prem offering, continuing to innovate at a faster pace with these new cloud-native offerings is a whole new source value for us. And so some of that is embedded with those investment spending increases, along with the go-to-market to make sure that we're getting the word out, and we're in front of the customers we need to be. Yes. I think in the first, with \u2013 as lead times come in a bit, and we're seeing that with certain of our product lines, you need less coverage, particularly if you're a machine builder, you don't need as many months of coverage of the products to complete your equipment. And so that's going to reduce the size and maybe the frequency of those orders. And I think that is a positive trend because it means customer service is coming back to where we expected to be. And graphically, you see a bit of that on some of the charts that we showed. In terms of customers with your second point, customers saying, no, we don't really need it now, not seeing much of that. I can tell you that the calls I'm having with customers frequently are that they want their stuff. And so we're not seeing much at all in the way of customers saying, ship it when you can. That stuff I ordered a few weeks ago. Don't worry. I'm not getting those calls. So that would be my characterization of what we're seeing. Yes, those are quarterly rates and I'd put them more in the noise category. I mean, these are rates that are low single digits and they're well within the range of what we've seen historically. Yes. Good morning, Steve. Yes. So we don't provide specific information on incoming orders by industry. But based on the line of sight that we have with customers in these areas where we're working specifically with them on projects, whether it's in pharmaceutical for getting new medicines to market or it's new plants for EV like the Hyundai win or oil and gas wins that we see through Sensia. We've got pretty good line of sight to that incoming activity, and it remains robust. I mean, again, while the order rates have moderated a bit, they're still well above pre-pandemic levels in the verticals that I talked about during my tour in answer to Scott's question. Sure. Let me start with that and then Nick may have additional comment. The Software & Control story is really around reduced volume. There's nothing in there with software rev rec, Plex continues to perform well. We didn't talk as much about it on the call, but we're very happy with the development of Plex, with the strategic value, the industrial logic as well as the financial performance of Plex, and we will talk more about that during Investor Day in a few weeks. So there's nothing there that's causing margins to be affected. It's more about the volume. And the issue that I talked a little bit about is with a specific components that are disproportionately used in Software & Control, there's a reduced supply for a portion of Q1 that picks back up. And so really, that's \u2013 we're giving a little bit more insight there. But that's what's causing the reduction after an over 30% year-over-year growth rate in the fourth quarter with Software & Control. And as we've talked about often, all of our products are very highly impacted, positively by increasing growth. We saw that manifested in Q4 with Software & Control, and we're seeing that moderate in Q1 and then with sequential growth from there through the balance of the year. Hey, Andy. Yes. I like talking about shoring rather than reshoring because it's really more about the U.S. being an outsized beneficiary of new CapEx as opposed to shuttering plants in China and other parts of Asia and bringing it back to the U.S. It's really about new lines of business, new capacity, filling out a little more of a local-for-local strategy, got a lot of manufacturers are providing, and I don't see anything with the current economic headwinds that would cause people to say just kidding. Let's go back to pushing manufacturing to other parts of the world and chase lower labor rates. I see, if anything, the U.S. continuing to be a beneficiary as people are trying to add redundant lines as people are trying to get closer to their consumers so that they're not having to rely on 10,000-mile supply chains. We're going to continue. And one of the things I look at is our own plans as a manufacturer. What is Rockwell doing? And we look at our CapEx that Nick talked about, which is up year-over-year for things that we feel like we need to do for the near-term in office to sustain share gains going forward and the continued investment in the U.S. We have a very important manufacturing that we're going to continue in the U.S. because it's our biggest market. And we continue to support manufacturing close to consumer here just as we do in Europe and in Asia and in Latin America. So process, we're expecting good things in fiscal year 2023. And this is an area where even apart from the recent activity, the recent dynamics backlog is very meaningful. And so when we look at backlog, for instance, in Sensia, it's very strong. It's an even higher number in terms of the percentage of revenue that's in backlog for fiscal 2023 than the Rockwell company average. And that's typical because it's engineered solutions that take longer to plan and stage and design, commission and so on. So we see that as a good read for oil and gas. There's activity in mining, and we've had some decent wins. I wouldn't call mining back at a torrid pace there. Metal is pretty good. And we don't talk as much about metals, but metals continues to be a big automation market and especially with the release of some of the new high-performance drives, we've got better capacity, better capabilities than we've had in years for addressing that market. There's still some activity in forest products and chemicals, and we talked about the win with Bora LyondellBasell, where our offerings, our continued enhancement of offerings with Logix Space control systems is going to help us in chemical, the new IO that we're going to be introducing an automation fair is going to be a major step for chemical as well. So those are some of the things going on there. And then in life science, as you mentioned that, really strong growth in the fourth quarter. We've talked about how life sciences is not as affected by the component shortages because so much of our business in life sciences is actually based on software and high-value services. And from a macro standpoint, people want to live longer, healthier lives and personalized medicine is a way to help that objective, and that's something that we're particularly strong in. Sure. Well, let me start by saying that the overarching driver is what we have in backlog, over $5 billion in backlog is unprecedented. And with continued strong order entry and with continued very low cancellation rates, that's the primary story. Now in terms of the tone, I did mention during my prepared remarks that we feel like a conservative approach is appropriate. I'm not going to dimension that or quantify that, but that was a deliberate comment in the prepared remarks. Well, we're very happy at the increased participation in M&A that we've demonstrated over the last few years and more importantly, the way that it's helped add new value for customers as well as investors. And we'll go into this in a little more detail in a couple of weeks at Investor Day. But first, looking at the strategic fit with some well-defined priorities that we've talked about and then the financial framework. We're very happy with the way that our M&A that we've already completed, most recently with the CUBIC acquisition and that we have in the funnel will continue to strengthen us as a pure-play automation provider. It's one of our strengths, and the market access that we have to provide new value from M&A immediately into all of the industry segments of discrete and hybrid and process is second to none. So I'm happy with the way that we're positioned with M&A. We're going to keep doing it. We have a strong balance sheet, and we've got a great track record of turning these acquisitions into real value."

Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead.\nAijana Zellner: Thanks Rex. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include and our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our Company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. So with that, I'll hand it over to Blake.\nBlake Moret: Thanks Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I want to also take this opportunity to congratulate Aijana on her promotion since our last earnings call. Let's turn to our third quarter results on Slide 3. We had a strong quarter with orders, shipments, margin, and profit, all at or above our expectations. We successfully navigated supply chain disruptions in a still volatile environment. And we saw the positive impact of pricing actions that demonstrate our strong position in the market. Total orders grew over 17% versus prior year with strong demand in all three business segments. Our continued orders strength reflects the value our customers place on Rockwell's differentiated offerings and the increased need for automation solutions regardless of the current macroeconomic backdrop. Total revenue of almost $2 billion was up 6.5% year-over-year. Organic sales came in as expected and grew over 7% versus prior year. Acquisitions contributed 2.5 points of growth. Currency translation reduced sales by over 3% driven by continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. While we saw a gradual overall improvement in supply chain through the quarter, our sales volume and mix continue to be impacted by component shortages as we've been discussing for a while now. Our top line performance, both by segment and region was driven by specific component availability in Q3, more than the underlying demand, which remains strong. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales were up over 2% year-over-year, but below expectations. This segment was disproportionately impacted by component availability, further exacerbated by extended China COVID shutdowns. Software & Control organic sales growth of over 13% versus prior year was above expectations. A strong performance here reflects both an improvement in the chip supply and some early benefits from the recent resiliency investments. Sales of our View operator interface panels, which we redesigned to optimize our component supply, were up almost 60% year-over-year. Our software sales grew double-digits versus prior year. In Lifecycle Services, organic sales increased almost 9% versus the prior year, despite continued component shortages and a partial shutdown of our Shanghai facility earlier in the quarter. Within Lifecycle Services, Sensia had another quarter of strong growth with both orders and sales up over 20% year-over-year. Sales in our services business also grew double-digits driven by higher demand for asset management and cybersecurity. Lifecycle Services\u2019 book-to-bill was 1.27 in the quarter, reflecting continued strength in our orders. Information Solutions & Connected Services, orders and sales both grew strong double-digits in the quarter with particular strength in the MES software and industrial cybersecurity sales. Within Information Solutions, we had a number of strategic wins this quarter, thanks to our industry leading portfolio of scalable and flexible software offerings. For instance, Eli Lilly and Company has chosen Rockwell Automation's PharmaSuite MES solution as the next-generation MES platform for their drug products. In addition to our on-prem software wins, we continue to gain traction with our recent cloud native acquisitions. One of our Plex wins this quarter was with ZEVx, an Arizona based company, focused on electrification of light and medium duty fleet vehicles worldwide. Our smart manufacturing platform will help this customer's aggressive growth plan with advanced supplier and inventory management, improved data visibility and reporting. We're also happy to report the sale of a Plex application that will run natively on Microsoft Azure in Europe, as well as a growing list of wins in food and beverage companies. These are important deal synergies that we are starting to realize. At Fiix, we continue to see strong double-digit sales growth led by both new logo wins and expansion deals. Our competitive maintenance management wins across many verticals, including EV and food and beverage reflect the platform's differentiated AI capabilities and ease of deployment. Connected Services\u2019 orders and sales were also strong in the quarter, demonstrating customers increasing reliance on our deep domain expertise, cybersecurity services and 24/7 remote support, especially as many companies are struggling with labor shortages and temporary budget constraints. In the quarter, total ARR was up almost 60%, an organic ARR grew 18%. Our strong operating performance and focus on price cost execution resulted in exceptional earnings this quarter. With adjusted EPS growing 15% versus prior year. Let's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q3 end market performance. As I mentioned earlier, what we saw a gradual overall improvement in supply chain constraints this quarter, some of our businesses and industry verticals mainly discrete and the hardware intensive parts of hybrid were disproportionately impacted by the ongoing component supply issues. In our discrete industries, sales were up low single-digits. Within this industry segment, automotive sales were up 6% versus prior year. We continue to see investments in the EV transition from both traditional brand owners and EV startups with a healthy mix of greenfield and brownfield activities. In Q3, we had a strategic greenfield win in Asia, where a Chinese automotive company, Chery Auto chose Rockwell's differentiated MES IoT and core automation offerings over their traditional European supplier to build a smart plant and increase their speed to market. In addition to working with leading electric vehicle manufacturers, we continue to gain share in the EV battery space. With several competitive wins in the quarter, both in Asia and Europe, while most of our previous wins in this space were in battery assembly and conveyance. We're starting to expand our presence in battery cells. Rockwell's integrated logics and motion offering was selected by Doer Clean Technology Systems to provide an end to end coating process from powder handling and slurry mixing to coating and drying. Semiconductor sales decline 2% versus prior year and were significantly impacted by COVID-related shutdowns in China. Despite the near-term supply chain challenges impacting its own ecosystem this industry continues to see strong demand with about 80 greenfield and 300 brownfield projects announced today. In the e-commerce and warehouse automation, our sales were down over 15% in the quarter, mainly driven by electronic component shortages and tough prior year comps. While we are seeing a slowdown in investments from some e-commerce customers, we continue to work with traditional retailers and grocers who are investing in new automated infrastructure to gain share in the market. Turning to our Hybrid Industry segment. Sales in this segment grew mid single digits led by growth in life sciences and food and beverage. Food and beverage sales were up mid single digits versus prior year, while inflation might put some pressure on new expansion investments, we continue to expect, especially strong demand in certain markets like agriculture processing, where Rockwell has high share and a differentiated technology offering. We saw a number of CapEx wins in Latin America this quarter with one of our food and beverage wins coming from CP Kelco a Brazilian nature-based ingredients manufacturer, which chose Rockwell and our plant PlantPAx process control architecture as their automation partner for the next capacity expansion project. Life sciences sales grew over 15% in Q3 with strong year-over-year growth in medical devices, pharma and biotech. This was another industry where our differentiated process controller along with strong network infrastructure and overall project management expertise helped us win a competitive project with Thermo Fisher in their joint venture plant in China. A combination of industry leading MES and IoT software and the multidiscipline logics platform for hybrid applications along with our increasing expertise in biotech and cell gene therapies position us well in this fast growing vertical. Tire was up low single digits in the quarter, we continued to see increased customer demand for our software and services in this vertical. In the quarter, we had our first Plex win in tire with Prometeon Tyre Group, a global leader in tire manufacturing, headquartered in Italy. The customer chose our Plex QMS to standardize quality management across its global operations. Moving to process. This industry segment group 12% versus prior year with oil and gas, mining and metals all growing double digits. We continue to grow our presence in process by displacing the traditional DCS players across oil and gas, mining and chemical industries. Our investments in process control technology and petrochemical expertise are paying off as demonstrated by our recent wins in North America and Europe. We also had a strategic multimillion dollar ESG win where Rockwell will be helping one of the most active operators in the Permian Basin, reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and bring all operated oil and gas assets to net zero by 2050. Turning now to Slide 5 in our Q3 organic regional sales performance. Once again, these results were heavily impacted by our component availability. North America organic sales grew by 11% versus the prior year, Latin America sales increased by over 15%, EMEA sales were up over 3% and Asia Pacific was down almost 6%. Let's move to Slide 6, an update to a new slide we had provided last quarter. As you can see, order cancellations remained very low and are within our historical ranges. Our strong orders and record backlog of over $5 billion, continue to support strong sales in fiscal year 2022 and beyond. As we turn to Slide 7 let's review highlights for the full year outlook. Orders are expected to stay strong for the remainder of this fiscal year. While we continue to expect strong double digit year-over-year and sequential organic sales growth in Q4, resulting in double digit growth for the full year, we're reducing the midpoint of our organic growth range to 11%. Our revised guidance reflects ongoing supply chain volatility in this environment, especially for business operations and suppliers located in Asia. The supply of electronic components is gradually improving, but remains volatile. Acquisitions are expected to contribute 2.5 points of profitable growth, more than offsetting a 2 point headwind from currency translation. We continue to expect double digit growth in both core automation as well as information solutions and connected services. We continue to expect another year of double digit annual recurring revenue growth. Our organic investments and acquisitions help make this revenue stream become a more meaningful contributor to our overall business resilience. Our additional investments in resiliency actions are progressing well as we develop deeper relationships with key suppliers, complete redesign projects and realize price to mitigate inflation. We expect our margins to expand in Q4 on higher sales and continued price cost execution. With only one more quarter to go, we have narrowed our adjusted EPS guidance range with our midpoint still at $9.50. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion of 85% for the full year. Nick will now add detail to our Q3 results and financial outlook for fiscal 2022. Nick?\nNick Gangestad: Thank you, Blake and good morning everyone. I'll start on Slide 9, third quarter key financial information. Third quarter reported sales were up 6.5% over last year with organic sales up 7.1% and acquisitions adding another 2.5 points to total growth. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 3.1%, while the U.S. dollar has strengthened against many currencies, the strength against the euro has had the largest impact on Rockwell in the quarter. We saw our organic sales improve through the quarter, helped by some easing of supply chain constraints following the listing of COVID restrictions in China. Segment operating margin was 20.8%, an increase of 90 basis points versus last year, mostly due to higher sales and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by higher investment spend. Last quarter, we shared our expectation that price cost would improve significantly in Q3. And that is exactly what happened. Price in the quarter more than offset our year-over-year increases in input costs. Our adjusted EPS in the quarter was $2.66, up 15% from the prior year. I\u2019ll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was 14.5% and in line with the prior year. This was better than our expectations due to a favorable return to provision true up. Free cash flow dollar generation was $327 million in the quarter and down compared to the prior year due to higher working capital primarily in receivables. We saw a higher percentage of our sales in June than in the prior year and our free cash flow conversion exceeded 100% in the quarter, despite our increases in working capital. One additional item not shown on the slide. We repurchased 860,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $176 million. On June 30, $1.3 billion remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 10 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. We had a good quarter with organic sales up in all three business segments both year-over-year and sequentially. Improving sales in our strong operating execution resulted in sequential margin growth of over 500 basis points. Intelligent Devices organic sales were up 2.7% in Q3. This segment had the largest negative impact in the quarter from component availability and extended shutdowns in China. Compared to last year, Intelligent Devices margins declined 220 basis points to 19.7% primarily driven by higher investment spend. Year-over-year price increases were able to neutralize the impact of higher input costs. Margin in this segment improves sequentially by 510 basis points driven by positive price costs and higher volume. Software & Control total sales were up 19%, including 13.4% organic growth versus the prior year. Strong sales were driven by improved chip supply and benefited from resiliency actions taken earlier in the year. Segment margins were up 620 basis points compared to last year and up 680 basis points sequentially, mostly due to higher sales. Price cost was positive year-over-year and sequentially. Lifecycle Services organic sales grew 8.7% led by strong double-digit growth in Sensia. Demand continues to remain strong across all businesses. Book-to-bill was 1.27 for Q3. Segment margin declined 90 basis points compared to the prior year driven by supply chain constraints and higher investment spend, partially offset by higher sales and lower incentive compensation. Segment margin was up against sequentially on higher sales. With gradual improvement in the supply chain, we expect the trend of sequential margin expansion to continue in the coming quarters. The next Slide 11 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q3 fiscal 2021 to Q3 fiscal 2022. Starting on the left. Core performance was up about $0.15, including about $0.25 from higher sales. Price cost contributed $0.05. Strong execution led to about $0.10 of productivity. We saw some favorable corporate items about half of which were due to timing between Q3 and Q4. We also continue to invest in growth and resiliency, which offset the core growth by $0.35. In the prior year, we made about $0.10 of non-recurring accelerated investments that mostly impacted our Software & Control business. Currency negatively impacted our earnings by about $0.10. On a year-over-year basis, incentive compensation was about a $0.20 tailwind. This brings us to our total adjusted EPS of $2.66. Let\u2019s move to the next Slide 12, our guidance for fiscal 2022. We are updating our sales guidance to a new range of approximately $7.7 billion to $7.9 billion in fiscal 2022, up 10.5% to 12.5% for the year. We expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 10% to 12%. And we expect about 2.5 points of growth coming from acquisitions and currency translation will be a headwind of about two points. Our sales guidance range reflects the continued volatility we see in the supply chain. The midpoint of our guidance implies a 9% sequential increase in Q4 total sales driven by improved material flow from key suppliers including those in China, further sequential improvement from resiliency actions and higher sequential price realization. We continue to expect full year segment operating margins to be about 20% and unchanged from our prior guide. We expect our margins to continue to expand in the fourth quarter. The margin expansion will come primarily from higher sequential sales and continued positive momentum on price costs. While price costs will be negative for the full year, it is positive in the second half. We now expect second half core conversion above 40%. We expect a full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 16.5%. And we are narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance range to $9.30 to $9.70 with no change to our midpoint of $9.50 from prior guidance. Finally, we continue to expect full year fiscal 2022 free cash flow conversion of about 85% of adjusted income. A few additional comments on fiscal 2022 guidance. Corporate and other expense is now projected to be around $110 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2022 is now expected to be about $120 million. We\u2019re assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 116.7 million shares. Finally on capital deployment, our capital allocation priorities for this year remain the same, including our focus on de-leveraging. As I mentioned earlier, we repurchased about $176 million worth of shares in Q3 and are now projecting our full year share repurchases to be about $300 million. Turning now to Page 13. While there is no change to the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance, we wanted to show some of the moving pieces within this number, starting on the left. There is a lower contribution due to the lower organic sales guidance. This is fully offset by improved productivity, favorable segment mix and lower corporate expenses. Currency is an additional headwind of about $0.05. A more favorable tax rate adds $0.05, which brings us to our midpoints of $9.50. Although not on this page, we continue to expect our acquisitions including Plex to be about neutral this year, including incremental interest expense or a year-over-year benefit of about $0.15. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake?\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Nick. We had a good quarter of growth, price realization, profitability, and investment for the future. We are executing well, and I\u2019m proud of how our teams are managing supply chain complexity to serve the needs of our customers. In volatile times, a relentless focus on helping customers creates long-term differentiation and value. Aijana, we will now begin the Q&A session.\nAijana Zellner: We would like to get to as many of you as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Rex, let\u2019s take our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis. [Melius Research] Your line is open.\nScott Davis: Good morning, guys. Good morning, Aijana.\nBlake Moret: Good morning.\nAijana Zellner: Good morning.\nScott Davis: Little bit different tone this quarter than last quarter, and that\u2019s nice to see it bounce back. But this may be a little hard to answer. But you have an order book that\u2019s up about 17%. How much of that and you don\u2019t have to give me an exact number, but is price because I know you had some pretty big price increases that were announced, is it order magnitude is half of that order book price? Is it \u2013 is there some way to kind of size that?\nNick Gangestad: Hey, Scott. For the full \u2013 for the third quarter, we had about 3.5% price growth for the total company. That\u2019s about half of our total organic growth. I think that\u2019s a pretty fair estimate to apply to our order growth as well. That 3.5% is about \u2013 of that 17% order growth, 3.5% of that is coming from price.\nScott Davis: Yes. Wow. So. Yes. Okay. Sorry, Blake.\nBlake Moret: Yes, Scott, I was just going to add. When we talk about orders, just to give some scale to the magnitude of the orders, they remain around 45% above pre pandemic levels. So in addition to the very large existing backlog, we\u2019re continuing to add that at a rate above our expectations.\nScott Davis: No, that\u2019s good to hear. And then you gave the example that cherry when example Blake, which I thought was interesting. Can \u2013 is a deal like that priced in U.S. dollars. Is it priced in local currency? I mean, how do you kind of compete against a suite of competitors that have such a big currency advantage if [indiscernible].\nBlake Moret: Hey Scott. Most of our transactions in a country like China are priced in the local currency and that\u2019s generally the way we do business. When there start to be large movements in FX, like what we\u2019re seeing there that becomes part of our pricing strategy. We have hedges in place to protect us, protect earnings in the short term. And in the longer term, then pricing becomes part of that strategy of how we\u2019ll adjust pricing in the local currency to be offsetting what we\u2019re seeing in terms of FX movements.\nScott Davis: Really helpful. All right, I\u2019ll pass it on. Good luck. Thank you.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski. [Morgan Stanley] Your line is open.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning, team.\nBlake Moret: Hi, Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Just Software & Control, pretty solid quarter there. I guess, that division has been a little bit less impacted by supply chain versus Intelligent Devices. But I guess if I think back to kind of other periods of macro volatility, it just seems to do this every now and then where you\u2019ll have a pretty decently big quarter on margins and the revenue. Anything lumpy in terms of shipments or availability pull forward, like you guys had earlier in the year, anything that could sort of give us a direction on timeline would be helpful?\nBlake Moret: Sure. Well, Josh, first of all limited pull through or pull forward in that. We\u2019re still looking at large year-over-year and sequential growth in Q4. I think you can think of this, the hardware portion of Software & Control as having less SKUs than Intelligent Devices. And the chip availability was relatively higher for Software & Control being able to ship logics, compact logics and the associated IO. So in the quarter it was less impacted. And again, with the kind of backlog that we have in the continuing orders, we can ship as much as we have components for across all of the business segments, and we expect that to be the case for quarters to come.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just quick follow-up on the orders, anything that you can kind of break down further in there, whether it\u2019s any currency headwinds, I noticed not a cancellations, but any kind of change in that growth. So have cancellation stepped up and project size like are those getting bigger or smaller? Thanks.\nNick Gangestad: Josh, we have been seeing over time the size of our orders getting larger and that trend continues. But in terms of the specifics of your question, there\u2019s really nothing significant to call out. Everything is tracking very similar to what we\u2019ve seen in the past. As Blake mentioned in our prepared comments, orders are coming in even stronger than what we had anticipated for the quarter.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: And the FX piece is that did that move around well? [Ph]\nNick Gangestad: FX is one of the things can impacting our orders within Europe, but \u2013 and that\u2019s included in what we\u2019re seeing for that. So seeing the Euro devalue about 10% and that\u2019s part of what we\u2019re seeing in the order in the total global orders that we reported in Q3.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Super helpful. Appreciate it. Best of luck.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell. [Barclays] Your line is open.\nAijana Zellner: Rex, let\u2019s move on to the next one.\nOperator: Excellent. Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz. [Citigroup] Your line is open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nBlake Moret: Good morning, Andy.\nNick Gangestad: Hey, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Blake, can you elaborate on your comments regarding and improving supply chain? Did you see continued improvement in component availability throughout the quarter and through July here? And I know you mentioned chip starting to get better. Maybe give us a little more color around that. Do you have visibility toward more normalized growth, less pressure by supply chain as you go into FY 2023?\nBlake Moret: So, Andy look, we continue to see chip constraints being a factor for the near term. We did see improvement through the quarter as you\u2019ll recall, we saw the more severe wave of COVID shutdowns in China in April and May. And we were able to largely recover from that as chips began flowing a little bit more strongly in the back half of the quarter. And we continued to see gradual improvement in Q4 and into our fiscal year 2023. But it remains a volatile situation. You can\u2019t count the chips until they show up on your receiving doc. But we do see a gradual improvement that continues into the early part of Q4.\nAndy Kaplowitz: And thanks for that Blake. And then Blake or Nick, I know you don\u2019t want to talk too much about 2023, but when you think about incremental margin, obviously it\u2019s picked up here in the second half, as you said, Nick. As you look at next year, maybe talk about the puts and takes you remind us about investments spend and incentive comp as we were in the second half at this point. And then, obviously growth is picking up. Usually you guys are 30% to 35%, but if growth is a bit higher, could you do higher incremental margins given the easy comps at least in the first half of the year?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. So some of the puts and takes to be thinking about that we\u2019re thinking about for fiscal year 2023. As Blake just said, supply chain component availability that\u2019s going to continue to be probably our most important factor in particular around growth. Some of the things that will be impacting our margin and what we\u2019re thinking about now is aspects like price cost, where as I\u2019ve said earlier, that was negative in the first half of the year, shifting to positive in the second half, we expect that to continue to be positive for us. Issues like inflation, issues like FX and what that can be doing to our profit and margin. The level of investment spend another factor we\u2019re thinking about. We also have a number of new product launches and how that will be impacting us in fiscal year 2023. So all of those things in comp, oh, the other one, we \u2013 right now, we are paying a bonus this year that is below our normal planned level. We would expect that to go back to the planned level in fiscal year 2023, all of those things in combination, we think the \u2013 our financial framework around core conversion of 30% to 35% remains a good starting point to think about 2023 and profit and margin expansion for us.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Thanks for that, Nick.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell. [Barclays]. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks very much and good morning. Maybe Nick, I know there was an effort there to talk about next year\u2019s sort of EBIT bridge moving parts. But if we just focus on Slide 4, sorry, Slide 11 and you look at those main points around price cost, investment spend, productivity and incentive comp, maybe those items in particular, when we\u2019re thinking about the fourth quarter and the year-on-year impact, anything major to call out versus what you just saw in the third quarter? I\u2019m assuming price cost is a bigger tailwind than that $0.05 figure. But anything perhaps to mention on investment spend or productivity or the incentive comp for Q4?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. In Q4, a couple things that are changing. I had mentioned in my prepared remarks, corporate items, while it\u2019s a benefit for Q3. We expect some of that is timing and we\u2019ll come back in Q4 that will flip from being a benefit to a headwind in Q4 versus what we were originally estimating price costs, as you estimated will continue to improve for us. Volume will continue to be a positive as we're expecting even higher volume growth in Q4 then in Q3. And then overall investment spend, we expect that to be pretty flat between Q3 and Q4, not really a big change happening there. And we do expect productivity to continue to be a benefit to us in Q4 as well.\nJulian Mitchell: That's very helpful. Thank you, Nick. And then maybe sort of a broader question, the Software & Control operating margins very volatile, particularly from the outside and maybe the inside as well. Quite hard to predict on a sort of three to six month view. It looks like for the sort of in fiscal half overall, you have a low 30s sort of Software & Control operating margin. Is that a reasonable sort of run rate looking into 2023 and the medium term, or are there any sort of exceptional mix tailwinds or something that you'd call out that are bolstering that Software & Control margin right now?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, so a few things to keep in mind when you're looking at the margins that we've been experiencing and experiencing right now. The higher margin that we had in Q3 are higher sales volume was by far the driving factor on that. In the first half of the year, it was being negatively impacted by a lower volume growth. It was also being impacted by negative price cost, which is now flipping to positive. We also, in the first half of the year, where we had the lion's share of our Plex integration expenses. And while we're still investing there, that's going to be at a lower level. So the 30 plus percent that we're experiencing, I don't see that as something being off track of what to be expecting going forward from Software & Control.\nJulian Mitchell: That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye [Oppenheimer & Company]. Your line is open.\nNoah Kaye: Thanks for taking the question. Blake, obviously looks like we're going to have elevated backlogs here for a period of time, given the continuing order strength but you mentioned e-commerce as one area starting to slow down, any other pockets where you're starting to see some softening, I know, possibly in the longer cycle type parts of the business. It can all be green lights at this point. So, curious for where you think we may see some softness as we head into 2023 in the order environment and where you think you've got some cushion there in terms of the mix of products and services you're offering.\nBlake Moret: Yes. Thanks, Noah. I think e-commerce in particular has been the outlier that we've seen so far in that they've taken a pause and in some of the expansion. Within that vertical, we also talk about warehouse automation outside of e-commerce. And they're continuing to look at productivity opportunities with in some cases, reducing labor requirements, more efficient handling of product at the front end and of their process and of their stores. So that continues to be pretty strong with some nice, recent wins there. I would say in general, the closer to the consumer that you are, those would be the areas that we're probably watching the most closely. We do continue to see strong industrial production figures. And as you know, over a long period of time, IP is what Rockwell's performance \u2013 top line performance is most correlated to. And we still see a positive IP number in our served markets, especially in the U.S. So EV continues strong. We've talked before that. It's hard to imagine that either the established brand owners or the startups are going to take a pause in trying to convert their fleet capacity to EV, they're going to have to continue because they got fear of missing out and being able to get in early to get some experience and to get some volume there. Semiconductor, we see a lot of in-process activity, regardless of what happens from a legislative standpoint, pharmaceutical, food and beverage. It's just hard to bet, too much against these verticals but again, e-commerce, so we have seen some softening and in general, the closer to the consumer, you are, maybe recreational vehicles but that's obviously, it's not a big part of our overall auto number there.\nNoah Kaye: Yes. And maybe just to follow up on this, I don't know if the current environment affects how customers think about on-prem versus cloud native, but what are you seeing in terms of customer preferences. Does this environment create a little bit more momentum for cloud native? And are you seeing kind of relatively stronger orders trends on some of your cloud native offerings and talk about that kind of balance configurations?\nBlake Moret: Sure. No, it's a good question. I mean, some of the advantages of a cloud native deployment is that you don't have to continue to invest or to create a large IT on-prem infrastructure to either acquire the assets, the servers and such and the IT staff. You can deploy a cloud native solution much quicker and that's why offerings like Plex and Fiix have been so popular among small and medium sized businesses that just don't have that money to invest in those areas. And they want to get up and running quick, they're on a kind of a quicker time constant there. And some of the bigger companies are taking that play and looking at how they can apply that as well. And I think that's part of the reason that we're seeing Plex win in some of the verticals that were part of the synergy that we had baked into the model where we see food and beverage, tire, these are new verticals that they just didn't have the resources to address. And we're seeing some wins there. And similarly with Fiix, some of the wins that we've seen in Asia, in India, for instance I think are part of that where customers want it now, and they don't want to have to wait to build all the infrastructure. So it's part of the reason that we have a parallel offering. We have a really strong on-prem offering with our production center based MES that continues to grow well. And then Plex and Fiix are doing what we expected them to do for us.\nNoah Kaye: Okay. Thanks for the color, Blake. Appreciate it.\nBlake Moret: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa [J.P. Morgan]. Your line is open.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, good morning.\nBlake Moret: Hey, Steve.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: So what are you guys seeing in the process industries just as a start or orders there seem to be holding up pretty well.\nBlake Moret: Yes. Orders are going quite well in process and I would say, orders and shipments for that matter. If you notice that we gave a little bit more in the way of customer wins this quarter, that wasn't a coincidence. I have seen the number of bigger wins tick up a bit in process. And I think some of the investments that we've made over the last really five or six years beginning with MAVERICK in expertise, obviously the joint venture was Schlumberger, Sensia, Kalypso, that expertise along with the steady drumbeat of new technology introductions are helping increase the win rate. And as Nick mentioned, increasing the order size, from a macro standpoint, oil and gas spending, particularly in areas of efficiency, which is really where we're centered even more than the CapEx side of things is helpful. But chemical had, I think, their best quarter ever for us, metals still a very big automation market, mining out there. I don't think mining has hit its full stride, but we are seeing activity particularly in battery materials. So a lot of wins in lithium over the recent past.\nSteve Tusa: Just to follow up on the \u2013 I guess, the S&C margin and then the cash flow. Nick, what do you think is kind of your long-term cash conversion? I mean, this year 85% is a little low relative to history. It actually, I mean, your fourth quarter looks like a pretty big step up to get to that number to begin with, but even putting that aside, maybe you could just comment on that. What \u2013 how much confidence you guys have in that fourth quarter ramp, because it's a big number, but then beyond that, what is the normal cash conversion. And does that lower cash conversion have anything to do with the growing software revenue that may be a little more lumpy versus the actual cash?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, thanks for that question, Steve. On the cash flow conversion side, 100% is our \u2013 what I consider our normal run rate. In fiscal year 2022, we are seeing noticeable increases in our working capital, some of the supply chain constraints that we're seeing. We see places where we've been building inventory. And so the biggest constraint on that's causing our free cash flow projection for the full year to be 85% is working capital. I don't think that's a permanent thing. I think that we will start to see some normalcy. In fact, we expect our working capital to be in total dollars to be coming down in the fourth quarter. And that's why we're expecting a pretty noticeable free cash flow generation in Q4 to benefit, it'll be benefited by higher profits in Q4, but even higher conversion as we bring down some of those working capital balances. It won't get to normal in 2022, but in 2023 and 2024, we see our working capital, the types of turns we have getting back closer to our normal range, which is why I say 100% is about right. You mentioned a little at the beginning on Software & Control margin. Is there something in particular you wanted to talk about on that, Steve?\nSteve Tusa: Yes. I hopped on a little late, but the margin there was obviously very strong. Is there something \u2013 what was driving that outside of maybe just the \u2013 was it just the devices within that business, the price cost there? Or is there something else going on with the more software oriented revenue streams?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. First of all, it\u2019s not being negatively impacted by software. That\u2019s a nice growing part of the total software. Portfolio part of that business is portfolio. The three big things that were driving up the margin this quarter, one is the higher sales. This is a business that \u2013 as our sales go up, we clearly see the margin benefit impacting that. We were also benefited by price cost, looking from negative in the first half of the year to being positive in the third quarter, it will become even more positive in the fourth quarter. And then finally, you maybe missed me say that earlier, earlier we were investing more in our Plex integration and while we\u2019re still investing the level of investment in Plex integration is as planned coming down. And that\u2019s another thing that\u2019s helping our margin go up in software and control.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: The next question comes from a line of Andrew Obin [Bank of America]. Your line is open.\nAndrew Obin: Hi. Yes. Good morning.\nBlake Moret: Hey Andrew.\nNick Gangestad: Hi, Andrew.\nAijana Zellner: Good morning.\nAndrew Obin: Just a question in terms of, as we think about supply chain for chips. As far as you can tell, where are we in terms of adding capacity for what you need, right? Because based on talking to chip brokers, sort of lower end stuff that industrials use are still in very short supply. And my understanding is that the big hope is capacity additions in North America. At the same time, we\u2019re hearing that not only you guys can get chips, but guys like Lam Research can get chips to provide the equipment. So where are we in terms of the scope and timing of capacity additions in North America over the next 12 to 18 months that would be relevant for Rockwell? Thank you.\nBlake Moret: Yes, it\u2019s a good question, Andrew. And it supports the thesis of gradually improving supply. So obviously it\u2019s important for us to continue to deepen relationships with our existing suppliers. And the ones that are going to be most important to us, going forward are ones for whom industrial is an important part of their business models. And as we talk to them specifically about the process nodes and the increased supply, that\u2019s going to be important to us, we see some of that capacity starting to come online at the end of this calendar year. So TI has a couple of plants coming online, analog devices, Intel with their Tower acquisition recently and some of their new investments. So we look closely at the new capacity and while a lot of it is in the leading edge notes for handsets and communications and so on for the suppliers that are most important to us, they are making investments in the fabs that are going to produce the wafers that ultimately result in the chips that are most important to us. So when we go through our analysis product by product and chip by chip within those products, we look at are we getting increased allocation, are redesign efforts going to have an impact such as with the view terminals that I\u2019ve talked about for the last couple of quarters. And we have some more of those projects that are coming to fruition here in the next few months and then the capacity additions that are coming from either our existing suppliers or in some cases, new suppliers that we\u2019re adding to the list of qualified vendors there.\nAndrew Obin: Thank you. And just a follow up question also to keep on chips. There is a lot of news on incremental semiconductor capacity coming into the U.S., specifically I think Samsung has filed with the state of Texas. And the spending seems to be very, very material. I think $200 billion is what the number is used. The pushback we get on this thesis that this is important for you guys is that historically, semiconductor end market just doesn\u2019t represent a large vertical for you. Yet the spending number seems to be very material, right, very material impact on overall CapEx in the U.S. How should we think about opportunity in semiconductors for Rockwell? And are you having conversations with the folks who are in the news that would be material to your numbers over the next year or two? Thanks.\nBlake Moret: Yes. I would characterize the opportunity as growing both in terms of the base of total announced CapEx as well as our ability to serve. So traditionally the majority of our business in semiconductors has been the facilities management control systems, the FMCS systems, which are controlling the temperature and the cleanliness and the humidity of the air in the environment, particularly in clean rooms. And we\u2019ve always had some capability in that space, turns out that Maverick is really good at that as well. And so we considerably increased our expertise in that area. There are drives that go into those air handling systems, and we\u2019re beginning to win a larger proportion of the drives in addition to the software and the engineering in those FMCS systems. And those are multimillion dollar systems. We\u2019re one few of those here recently that are noteworthy. Independent cart for material handling is also a technology that we didn\u2019t traditionally have. And as that technology gets qualified for clean room environments, we\u2019re seeing increased opportunities there. Cyber security, so obviously these fabs are very concerned about being resilient in that dimension as well. And we\u2019ve got the best offering to go in on the production floor. So we\u2019re seeing a lot of meaningful wins in cyber security as well. So those are just a few of the areas that we\u2019re providing value, not only for the direct fabs themselves, but also for the capital equipment suppliers, which remain good customers of ours.\nAndrew Obin: And as more incremental capacity sort of shifts to North America versus what we\u2019ve seen Asia, does it create opportunities and adjacencies longer-term that have not been present just to grow organically or through M&A?\nBlake Moret: Yes, for sure, because you\u2019ve got ecosystems. It\u2019s one thing to announce a fab and for Intel or TI or Micron or Samsung to build their facility, but they need a village, right? They need an ecosystem in each of these areas for the chemicals that are need, the substrates, the lead frames, all of those things. And those are all opportunities for us, particularly in the U.S., where we have overwhelmingly the strongest support and installed base.\nAndrew Obin: Very much.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Rob Mason. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Good morning. I had a question about the order pace. And what we\u2019ve been seeing there it sounds like, orders will still stay solid in the fourth quarter, maybe up a little bit. Previously Blake you talked about some order pull forwards \u2013 pull ahead, I\u2019m just curious how that dynamic is continuing to play out in the order rate if you\u2019re still seeing that if it\u2019s backed off. You talked about larger order sizes, whether that plays into that dynamic that you spoke to.\nBlake Moret: Yes. I think there\u2019s still \u2013 some of what we\u2019ve talked about in the past where, because the lead times are still long, they\u2019re longer than we or our customers would like. People are placing orders to cover that spread between now and when they actually expect to get the materials. And we see that most market with the machinery builders, they have a certain amount of machines and in the past they might have only placed orders to cover X months of those bookings that they have in their backlog and their needs for our automation equipment. And they may have doubled that at this point to be able to cover that. But that\u2019s the machine builders. And I think while we continue to see some of that, we hope to see over the coming quarters, those lead times pull in and we\u2019ve seen some green shoots where we\u2019ve seen some improvements in the lead times. In fact, we\u2019ve won some competitive business because we could deliver faster than competitors in certain areas. And as we see those lead times reduce naturally, we\u2019ll see the orders from some of those machine builders, for instance, reduce a bit. They also have big backlogs. And so, they\u2019re looking to get that material. But as shown by those continued low cancellation rates and as I mentioned earlier, these customers want the equipment they need it. And I can tell you from the conversations that we continue to have with the leadership of our customers, they continue to want that material just as fast as they can. So that would be, I\u2019d say the most tangible element of pull forward. But we don\u2019t see people placing orders in the last quarter, the current quarter to avoid price increases and things like that. So I would say our order development continues to be healthy.\nUnidentified Analyst: Very good. Just one quick follow up for Nick, just around price cost. It sounds like we\u2019ll continue to get some incremental benefit in the fourth quarter. Is there a way to think about the year-over-year benefit? Do we top out in the fourth quarter and start to moderate as we go into 2023? Or are you still expecting that year-over-year benefit to rise as you go into 2023?\nNick Gangestad: So the fourth quarter will be the highest benefit of all the quarters, Rob. Well, I\u2019m not guiding for 2023 yet. The first half of 2023 will be getting the benefit of the fact that we don\u2019t anticipate it to be negative as it was in the first half of 2022. So just the absence of that negative, we think creates some year-on-year benefit in the first half of fiscal year 2023. I\u2019m not yet guiding for the full year of 2023, what we\u2019re expecting for the net price cost.\nUnidentified Analyst: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Ms. Zellner, I turn the call back over to you.\nAijana Zellner: Thanks, Rex. Okay. That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s conference call. At this time you may disconnect. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nick Gangestad",
            "content": "Thank you, Blake and good morning everyone. I'll start on Slide 9, third quarter key financial information. Third quarter reported sales were up 6.5% over last year with organic sales up 7.1% and acquisitions adding another 2.5 points to total growth. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 3.1%, while the U.S. dollar has strengthened against many currencies, the strength against the euro has had the largest impact on Rockwell in the quarter. We saw our organic sales improve through the quarter, helped by some easing of supply chain constraints following the listing of COVID restrictions in China. Segment operating margin was 20.8%, an increase of 90 basis points versus last year, mostly due to higher sales and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by higher investment spend. Last quarter, we shared our expectation that price cost would improve significantly in Q3. And that is exactly what happened. Price in the quarter more than offset our year-over-year increases in input costs. Our adjusted EPS in the quarter was $2.66, up 15% from the prior year. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was 14.5% and in line with the prior year. This was better than our expectations due to a favorable return to provision true up. Free cash flow dollar generation was $327 million in the quarter and down compared to the prior year due to higher working capital primarily in receivables. We saw a higher percentage of our sales in June than in the prior year and our free cash flow conversion exceeded 100% in the quarter, despite our increases in working capital. One additional item not shown on the slide. We repurchased 860,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $176 million. On June 30, $1.3 billion remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 10 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. We had a good quarter with organic sales up in all three business segments both year-over-year and sequentially. Improving sales in our strong operating execution resulted in sequential margin growth of over 500 basis points. Intelligent Devices organic sales were up 2.7% in Q3. This segment had the largest negative impact in the quarter from component availability and extended shutdowns in China. Compared to last year, Intelligent Devices margins declined 220 basis points to 19.7% primarily driven by higher investment spend. Year-over-year price increases were able to neutralize the impact of higher input costs. Margin in this segment improves sequentially by 510 basis points driven by positive price costs and higher volume. Software & Control total sales were up 19%, including 13.4% organic growth versus the prior year. Strong sales were driven by improved chip supply and benefited from resiliency actions taken earlier in the year. Segment margins were up 620 basis points compared to last year and up 680 basis points sequentially, mostly due to higher sales. Price cost was positive year-over-year and sequentially. Lifecycle Services organic sales grew 8.7% led by strong double-digit growth in Sensia. Demand continues to remain strong across all businesses. Book-to-bill was 1.27 for Q3. Segment margin declined 90 basis points compared to the prior year driven by supply chain constraints and higher investment spend, partially offset by higher sales and lower incentive compensation. Segment margin was up against sequentially on higher sales. With gradual improvement in the supply chain, we expect the trend of sequential margin expansion to continue in the coming quarters. The next Slide 11 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q3 fiscal 2021 to Q3 fiscal 2022. Starting on the left. Core performance was up about $0.15, including about $0.25 from higher sales. Price cost contributed $0.05. Strong execution led to about $0.10 of productivity. We saw some favorable corporate items about half of which were due to timing between Q3 and Q4. We also continue to invest in growth and resiliency, which offset the core growth by $0.35. In the prior year, we made about $0.10 of non-recurring accelerated investments that mostly impacted our Software & Control business. Currency negatively impacted our earnings by about $0.10. On a year-over-year basis, incentive compensation was about a $0.20 tailwind. This brings us to our total adjusted EPS of $2.66. Let's move to the next Slide 12, our guidance for fiscal 2022. We are updating our sales guidance to a new range of approximately $7.7 billion to $7.9 billion in fiscal 2022, up 10.5% to 12.5% for the year. We expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 10% to 12%. And we expect about 2.5 points of growth coming from acquisitions and currency translation will be a headwind of about two points. Our sales guidance range reflects the continued volatility we see in the supply chain. The midpoint of our guidance implies a 9% sequential increase in Q4 total sales driven by improved material flow from key suppliers including those in China, further sequential improvement from resiliency actions and higher sequential price realization. We continue to expect full year segment operating margins to be about 20% and unchanged from our prior guide. We expect our margins to continue to expand in the fourth quarter. The margin expansion will come primarily from higher sequential sales and continued positive momentum on price costs. While price costs will be negative for the full year, it is positive in the second half. We now expect second half core conversion above 40%. We expect a full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 16.5%. And we are narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance range to $9.30 to $9.70 with no change to our midpoint of $9.50 from prior guidance. Finally, we continue to expect full year fiscal 2022 free cash flow conversion of about 85% of adjusted income. A few additional comments on fiscal 2022 guidance. Corporate and other expense is now projected to be around $110 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2022 is now expected to be about $120 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 116.7 million shares. Finally on capital deployment, our capital allocation priorities for this year remain the same, including our focus on de-leveraging. As I mentioned earlier, we repurchased about $176 million worth of shares in Q3 and are now projecting our full year share repurchases to be about $300 million. Turning now to Page 13. While there is no change to the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance, we wanted to show some of the moving pieces within this number, starting on the left. There is a lower contribution due to the lower organic sales guidance. This is fully offset by improved productivity, favorable segment mix and lower corporate expenses. Currency is an additional headwind of about $0.05. A more favorable tax rate adds $0.05, which brings us to our midpoints of $9.50. Although not on this page, we continue to expect our acquisitions including Plex to be about neutral this year, including incremental interest expense or a year-over-year benefit of about $0.15. With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake? Hey, Scott. For the full \u2013 for the third quarter, we had about 3.5% price growth for the total company. That's about half of our total organic growth. I think that's a pretty fair estimate to apply to our order growth as well. That 3.5% is about \u2013 of that 17% order growth, 3.5% of that is coming from price. Josh, we have been seeing over time the size of our orders getting larger and that trend continues. But in terms of the specifics of your question, there's really nothing significant to call out. Everything is tracking very similar to what we've seen in the past. As Blake mentioned in our prepared comments, orders are coming in even stronger than what we had anticipated for the quarter. FX is one of the things can impacting our orders within Europe, but \u2013 and that's included in what we're seeing for that. So seeing the Euro devalue about 10% and that's part of what we're seeing in the order in the total global orders that we reported in Q3. Hey, Andy. Yes. So some of the puts and takes to be thinking about that we're thinking about for fiscal year 2023. As Blake just said, supply chain component availability that's going to continue to be probably our most important factor in particular around growth. Some of the things that will be impacting our margin and what we're thinking about now is aspects like price cost, where as I've said earlier, that was negative in the first half of the year, shifting to positive in the second half, we expect that to continue to be positive for us. Issues like inflation, issues like FX and what that can be doing to our profit and margin. The level of investment spend another factor we're thinking about. We also have a number of new product launches and how that will be impacting us in fiscal year 2023. So all of those things in comp, oh, the other one, we \u2013 right now, we are paying a bonus this year that is below our normal planned level. We would expect that to go back to the planned level in fiscal year 2023, all of those things in combination, we think the \u2013 our financial framework around core conversion of 30% to 35% remains a good starting point to think about 2023 and profit and margin expansion for us. Yes. In Q4, a couple things that are changing. I had mentioned in my prepared remarks, corporate items, while it's a benefit for Q3. We expect some of that is timing and we'll come back in Q4 that will flip from being a benefit to a headwind in Q4 versus what we were originally estimating price costs, as you estimated will continue to improve for us. Volume will continue to be a positive as we're expecting even higher volume growth in Q4 then in Q3. And then overall investment spend, we expect that to be pretty flat between Q3 and Q4, not really a big change happening there. And we do expect productivity to continue to be a benefit to us in Q4 as well. Yes, so a few things to keep in mind when you're looking at the margins that we've been experiencing and experiencing right now. The higher margin that we had in Q3 are higher sales volume was by far the driving factor on that. In the first half of the year, it was being negatively impacted by a lower volume growth. It was also being impacted by negative price cost, which is now flipping to positive. We also, in the first half of the year, where we had the lion's share of our Plex integration expenses. And while we're still investing there, that's going to be at a lower level. So the 30 plus percent that we're experiencing, I don't see that as something being off track of what to be expecting going forward from Software & Control. Good morning, Steve. Yes, thanks for that question, Steve. On the cash flow conversion side, 100% is our \u2013 what I consider our normal run rate. In fiscal year 2022, we are seeing noticeable increases in our working capital, some of the supply chain constraints that we're seeing. We see places where we've been building inventory. And so the biggest constraint on that's causing our free cash flow projection for the full year to be 85% is working capital. I don't think that's a permanent thing. I think that we will start to see some normalcy. In fact, we expect our working capital to be in total dollars to be coming down in the fourth quarter. And that's why we're expecting a pretty noticeable free cash flow generation in Q4 to benefit, it'll be benefited by higher profits in Q4, but even higher conversion as we bring down some of those working capital balances. It won't get to normal in 2022, but in 2023 and 2024, we see our working capital, the types of turns we have getting back closer to our normal range, which is why I say 100% is about right. You mentioned a little at the beginning on Software & Control margin. Is there something in particular you wanted to talk about on that, Steve? Yes. First of all, it's not being negatively impacted by software. That's a nice growing part of the total software. Portfolio part of that business is portfolio. The three big things that were driving up the margin this quarter, one is the higher sales. This is a business that \u2013 as our sales go up, we clearly see the margin benefit impacting that. We were also benefited by price cost, looking from negative in the first half of the year to being positive in the third quarter, it will become even more positive in the fourth quarter. And then finally, you maybe missed me say that earlier, earlier we were investing more in our Plex integration and while we're still investing the level of investment in Plex integration is as planned coming down. And that's another thing that's helping our margin go up in software and control. Hi, Andrew. So the fourth quarter will be the highest benefit of all the quarters, Rob. Well, I'm not guiding for 2023 yet. The first half of 2023 will be getting the benefit of the fact that we don't anticipate it to be negative as it was in the first half of 2022. So just the absence of that negative, we think creates some year-on-year benefit in the first half of fiscal year 2023. I'm not yet guiding for the full year of 2023, what we're expecting for the net price cost."

            "content": "Thanks Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I want to also take this opportunity to congratulate Aijana on her promotion since our last earnings call. Let's turn to our third quarter results on Slide 3. We had a strong quarter with orders, shipments, margin, and profit, all at or above our expectations. We successfully navigated supply chain disruptions in a still volatile environment. And we saw the positive impact of pricing actions that demonstrate our strong position in the market. Total orders grew over 17% versus prior year with strong demand in all three business segments. Our continued orders strength reflects the value our customers place on Rockwell's differentiated offerings and the increased need for automation solutions regardless of the current macroeconomic backdrop. Total revenue of almost $2 billion was up 6.5% year-over-year. Organic sales came in as expected and grew over 7% versus prior year. Acquisitions contributed 2.5 points of growth. Currency translation reduced sales by over 3% driven by continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. While we saw a gradual overall improvement in supply chain through the quarter, our sales volume and mix continue to be impacted by component shortages as we've been discussing for a while now. Our top line performance, both by segment and region was driven by specific component availability in Q3, more than the underlying demand, which remains strong. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales were up over 2% year-over-year, but below expectations. This segment was disproportionately impacted by component availability, further exacerbated by extended China COVID shutdowns. Software & Control organic sales growth of over 13% versus prior year was above expectations. A strong performance here reflects both an improvement in the chip supply and some early benefits from the recent resiliency investments. Sales of our View operator interface panels, which we redesigned to optimize our component supply, were up almost 60% year-over-year. Our software sales grew double-digits versus prior year. In Lifecycle Services, organic sales increased almost 9% versus the prior year, despite continued component shortages and a partial shutdown of our Shanghai facility earlier in the quarter. Within Lifecycle Services, Sensia had another quarter of strong growth with both orders and sales up over 20% year-over-year. Sales in our services business also grew double-digits driven by higher demand for asset management and cybersecurity. Lifecycle Services' book-to-bill was 1.27 in the quarter, reflecting continued strength in our orders. Information Solutions & Connected Services, orders and sales both grew strong double-digits in the quarter with particular strength in the MES software and industrial cybersecurity sales. Within Information Solutions, we had a number of strategic wins this quarter, thanks to our industry leading portfolio of scalable and flexible software offerings. For instance, Eli Lilly and Company has chosen Rockwell Automation's PharmaSuite MES solution as the next-generation MES platform for their drug products. In addition to our on-prem software wins, we continue to gain traction with our recent cloud native acquisitions. One of our Plex wins this quarter was with ZEVx, an Arizona based company, focused on electrification of light and medium duty fleet vehicles worldwide. Our smart manufacturing platform will help this customer's aggressive growth plan with advanced supplier and inventory management, improved data visibility and reporting. We're also happy to report the sale of a Plex application that will run natively on Microsoft Azure in Europe, as well as a growing list of wins in food and beverage companies. These are important deal synergies that we are starting to realize. At Fiix, we continue to see strong double-digit sales growth led by both new logo wins and expansion deals. Our competitive maintenance management wins across many verticals, including EV and food and beverage reflect the platform's differentiated AI capabilities and ease of deployment. Connected Services' orders and sales were also strong in the quarter, demonstrating customers increasing reliance on our deep domain expertise, cybersecurity services and 24/7 remote support, especially as many companies are struggling with labor shortages and temporary budget constraints. In the quarter, total ARR was up almost 60%, an organic ARR grew 18%. Our strong operating performance and focus on price cost execution resulted in exceptional earnings this quarter. With adjusted EPS growing 15% versus prior year. Let's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q3 end market performance. As I mentioned earlier, what we saw a gradual overall improvement in supply chain constraints this quarter, some of our businesses and industry verticals mainly discrete and the hardware intensive parts of hybrid were disproportionately impacted by the ongoing component supply issues. In our discrete industries, sales were up low single-digits. Within this industry segment, automotive sales were up 6% versus prior year. We continue to see investments in the EV transition from both traditional brand owners and EV startups with a healthy mix of greenfield and brownfield activities. In Q3, we had a strategic greenfield win in Asia, where a Chinese automotive company, Chery Auto chose Rockwell's differentiated MES IoT and core automation offerings over their traditional European supplier to build a smart plant and increase their speed to market. In addition to working with leading electric vehicle manufacturers, we continue to gain share in the EV battery space. With several competitive wins in the quarter, both in Asia and Europe, while most of our previous wins in this space were in battery assembly and conveyance. We're starting to expand our presence in battery cells. Rockwell's integrated logics and motion offering was selected by Doer Clean Technology Systems to provide an end to end coating process from powder handling and slurry mixing to coating and drying. Semiconductor sales decline 2% versus prior year and were significantly impacted by COVID-related shutdowns in China. Despite the near-term supply chain challenges impacting its own ecosystem this industry continues to see strong demand with about 80 greenfield and 300 brownfield projects announced today. In the e-commerce and warehouse automation, our sales were down over 15% in the quarter, mainly driven by electronic component shortages and tough prior year comps. While we are seeing a slowdown in investments from some e-commerce customers, we continue to work with traditional retailers and grocers who are investing in new automated infrastructure to gain share in the market. Turning to our Hybrid Industry segment. Sales in this segment grew mid single digits led by growth in life sciences and food and beverage. Food and beverage sales were up mid single digits versus prior year, while inflation might put some pressure on new expansion investments, we continue to expect, especially strong demand in certain markets like agriculture processing, where Rockwell has high share and a differentiated technology offering. We saw a number of CapEx wins in Latin America this quarter with one of our food and beverage wins coming from CP Kelco a Brazilian nature-based ingredients manufacturer, which chose Rockwell and our plant PlantPAx process control architecture as their automation partner for the next capacity expansion project. Life sciences sales grew over 15% in Q3 with strong year-over-year growth in medical devices, pharma and biotech. This was another industry where our differentiated process controller along with strong network infrastructure and overall project management expertise helped us win a competitive project with Thermo Fisher in their joint venture plant in China. A combination of industry leading MES and IoT software and the multidiscipline logics platform for hybrid applications along with our increasing expertise in biotech and cell gene therapies position us well in this fast growing vertical. Tire was up low single digits in the quarter, we continued to see increased customer demand for our software and services in this vertical. In the quarter, we had our first Plex win in tire with Prometeon Tyre Group, a global leader in tire manufacturing, headquartered in Italy. The customer chose our Plex QMS to standardize quality management across its global operations. Moving to process. This industry segment group 12% versus prior year with oil and gas, mining and metals all growing double digits. We continue to grow our presence in process by displacing the traditional DCS players across oil and gas, mining and chemical industries. Our investments in process control technology and petrochemical expertise are paying off as demonstrated by our recent wins in North America and Europe. We also had a strategic multimillion dollar ESG win where Rockwell will be helping one of the most active operators in the Permian Basin, reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and bring all operated oil and gas assets to net zero by 2050. Turning now to Slide 5 in our Q3 organic regional sales performance. Once again, these results were heavily impacted by our component availability. North America organic sales grew by 11% versus the prior year, Latin America sales increased by over 15%, EMEA sales were up over 3% and Asia Pacific was down almost 6%. Let's move to Slide 6, an update to a new slide we had provided last quarter. As you can see, order cancellations remained very low and are within our historical ranges. Our strong orders and record backlog of over $5 billion, continue to support strong sales in fiscal year 2022 and beyond. As we turn to Slide 7 let's review highlights for the full year outlook. Orders are expected to stay strong for the remainder of this fiscal year. While we continue to expect strong double digit year-over-year and sequential organic sales growth in Q4, resulting in double digit growth for the full year, we're reducing the midpoint of our organic growth range to 11%. Our revised guidance reflects ongoing supply chain volatility in this environment, especially for business operations and suppliers located in Asia. The supply of electronic components is gradually improving, but remains volatile. Acquisitions are expected to contribute 2.5 points of profitable growth, more than offsetting a 2 point headwind from currency translation. We continue to expect double digit growth in both core automation as well as information solutions and connected services. We continue to expect another year of double digit annual recurring revenue growth. Our organic investments and acquisitions help make this revenue stream become a more meaningful contributor to our overall business resilience. Our additional investments in resiliency actions are progressing well as we develop deeper relationships with key suppliers, complete redesign projects and realize price to mitigate inflation. We expect our margins to expand in Q4 on higher sales and continued price cost execution. With only one more quarter to go, we have narrowed our adjusted EPS guidance range with our midpoint still at $9.50. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion of 85% for the full year. Nick will now add detail to our Q3 results and financial outlook for fiscal 2022. Nick? Thanks, Nick. We had a good quarter of growth, price realization, profitability, and investment for the future. We are executing well, and I'm proud of how our teams are managing supply chain complexity to serve the needs of our customers. In volatile times, a relentless focus on helping customers creates long-term differentiation and value. Aijana, we will now begin the Q&A session. Good morning. Yes, Scott, I was just going to add. When we talk about orders, just to give some scale to the magnitude of the orders, they remain around 45% above pre pandemic levels. So in addition to the very large existing backlog, we're continuing to add that at a rate above our expectations. Hey Scott. Most of our transactions in a country like China are priced in the local currency and that's generally the way we do business. When there start to be large movements in FX, like what we're seeing there that becomes part of our pricing strategy. We have hedges in place to protect us, protect earnings in the short term. And in the longer term, then pricing becomes part of that strategy of how we'll adjust pricing in the local currency to be offsetting what we're seeing in terms of FX movements. Thanks, Scott. Hi, Josh. Sure. Well, Josh, first of all limited pull through or pull forward in that. We're still looking at large year-over-year and sequential growth in Q4. I think you can think of this, the hardware portion of Software & Control as having less SKUs than Intelligent Devices. And the chip availability was relatively higher for Software & Control being able to ship logics, compact logics and the associated IO. So in the quarter it was less impacted. And again, with the kind of backlog that we have in the continuing orders, we can ship as much as we have components for across all of the business segments, and we expect that to be the case for quarters to come. Good morning, Andy. So, Andy look, we continue to see chip constraints being a factor for the near term. We did see improvement through the quarter as you'll recall, we saw the more severe wave of COVID shutdowns in China in April and May. And we were able to largely recover from that as chips began flowing a little bit more strongly in the back half of the quarter. And we continued to see gradual improvement in Q4 and into our fiscal year 2023. But it remains a volatile situation. You can't count the chips until they show up on your receiving doc. But we do see a gradual improvement that continues into the early part of Q4. Yes. Thanks, Noah. I think e-commerce in particular has been the outlier that we've seen so far in that they've taken a pause and in some of the expansion. Within that vertical, we also talk about warehouse automation outside of e-commerce. And they're continuing to look at productivity opportunities with in some cases, reducing labor requirements, more efficient handling of product at the front end and of their process and of their stores. So that continues to be pretty strong with some nice, recent wins there. I would say in general, the closer to the consumer that you are, those would be the areas that we're probably watching the most closely. We do continue to see strong industrial production figures. And as you know, over a long period of time, IP is what Rockwell's performance \u2013 top line performance is most correlated to. And we still see a positive IP number in our served markets, especially in the U.S. So EV continues strong. We've talked before that. It's hard to imagine that either the established brand owners or the startups are going to take a pause in trying to convert their fleet capacity to EV, they're going to have to continue because they got fear of missing out and being able to get in early to get some experience and to get some volume there. Semiconductor, we see a lot of in-process activity, regardless of what happens from a legislative standpoint, pharmaceutical, food and beverage. It's just hard to bet, too much against these verticals but again, e-commerce, so we have seen some softening and in general, the closer to the consumer, you are, maybe recreational vehicles but that's obviously, it's not a big part of our overall auto number there. Sure. No, it's a good question. I mean, some of the advantages of a cloud native deployment is that you don't have to continue to invest or to create a large IT on-prem infrastructure to either acquire the assets, the servers and such and the IT staff. You can deploy a cloud native solution much quicker and that's why offerings like Plex and Fiix have been so popular among small and medium sized businesses that just don't have that money to invest in those areas. And they want to get up and running quick, they're on a kind of a quicker time constant there. And some of the bigger companies are taking that play and looking at how they can apply that as well. And I think that's part of the reason that we're seeing Plex win in some of the verticals that were part of the synergy that we had baked into the model where we see food and beverage, tire, these are new verticals that they just didn't have the resources to address. And we're seeing some wins there. And similarly with Fiix, some of the wins that we've seen in Asia, in India, for instance I think are part of that where customers want it now, and they don't want to have to wait to build all the infrastructure. So it's part of the reason that we have a parallel offering. We have a really strong on-prem offering with our production center based MES that continues to grow well. And then Plex and Fiix are doing what we expected them to do for us. Sure. Hey, Steve. Yes. Orders are going quite well in process and I would say, orders and shipments for that matter. If you notice that we gave a little bit more in the way of customer wins this quarter, that wasn't a coincidence. I have seen the number of bigger wins tick up a bit in process. And I think some of the investments that we've made over the last really five or six years beginning with MAVERICK in expertise, obviously the joint venture was Schlumberger, Sensia, Kalypso, that expertise along with the steady drumbeat of new technology introductions are helping increase the win rate. And as Nick mentioned, increasing the order size, from a macro standpoint, oil and gas spending, particularly in areas of efficiency, which is really where we're centered even more than the CapEx side of things is helpful. But chemical had, I think, their best quarter ever for us, metals still a very big automation market, mining out there. I don't think mining has hit its full stride, but we are seeing activity particularly in battery materials. So a lot of wins in lithium over the recent past. Hey Andrew. Yes, it's a good question, Andrew. And it supports the thesis of gradually improving supply. So obviously it's important for us to continue to deepen relationships with our existing suppliers. And the ones that are going to be most important to us, going forward are ones for whom industrial is an important part of their business models. And as we talk to them specifically about the process nodes and the increased supply, that's going to be important to us, we see some of that capacity starting to come online at the end of this calendar year. So TI has a couple of plants coming online, analog devices, Intel with their Tower acquisition recently and some of their new investments. So we look closely at the new capacity and while a lot of it is in the leading edge notes for handsets and communications and so on for the suppliers that are most important to us, they are making investments in the fabs that are going to produce the wafers that ultimately result in the chips that are most important to us. So when we go through our analysis product by product and chip by chip within those products, we look at are we getting increased allocation, are redesign efforts going to have an impact such as with the view terminals that I've talked about for the last couple of quarters. And we have some more of those projects that are coming to fruition here in the next few months and then the capacity additions that are coming from either our existing suppliers or in some cases, new suppliers that we're adding to the list of qualified vendors there. Yes. I would characterize the opportunity as growing both in terms of the base of total announced CapEx as well as our ability to serve. So traditionally the majority of our business in semiconductors has been the facilities management control systems, the FMCS systems, which are controlling the temperature and the cleanliness and the humidity of the air in the environment, particularly in clean rooms. And we've always had some capability in that space, turns out that Maverick is really good at that as well. And so we considerably increased our expertise in that area. There are drives that go into those air handling systems, and we're beginning to win a larger proportion of the drives in addition to the software and the engineering in those FMCS systems. And those are multimillion dollar systems. We're one few of those here recently that are noteworthy. Independent cart for material handling is also a technology that we didn't traditionally have. And as that technology gets qualified for clean room environments, we're seeing increased opportunities there. Cyber security, so obviously these fabs are very concerned about being resilient in that dimension as well. And we've got the best offering to go in on the production floor. So we're seeing a lot of meaningful wins in cyber security as well. So those are just a few of the areas that we're providing value, not only for the direct fabs themselves, but also for the capital equipment suppliers, which remain good customers of ours. Yes, for sure, because you've got ecosystems. It's one thing to announce a fab and for Intel or TI or Micron or Samsung to build their facility, but they need a village, right? They need an ecosystem in each of these areas for the chemicals that are need, the substrates, the lead frames, all of those things. And those are all opportunities for us, particularly in the U.S., where we have overwhelmingly the strongest support and installed base. Yes. I think there's still \u2013 some of what we've talked about in the past where, because the lead times are still long, they're longer than we or our customers would like. People are placing orders to cover that spread between now and when they actually expect to get the materials. And we see that most market with the machinery builders, they have a certain amount of machines and in the past they might have only placed orders to cover X months of those bookings that they have in their backlog and their needs for our automation equipment. And they may have doubled that at this point to be able to cover that. But that's the machine builders. And I think while we continue to see some of that, we hope to see over the coming quarters, those lead times pull in and we've seen some green shoots where we've seen some improvements in the lead times. In fact, we've won some competitive business because we could deliver faster than competitors in certain areas. And as we see those lead times reduce naturally, we'll see the orders from some of those machine builders, for instance, reduce a bit. They also have big backlogs. And so, they're looking to get that material. But as shown by those continued low cancellation rates and as I mentioned earlier, these customers want the equipment they need it. And I can tell you from the conversations that we continue to have with the leadership of our customers, they continue to want that material just as fast as they can. So that would be, I'd say the most tangible element of pull forward. But we don't see people placing orders in the last quarter, the current quarter to avoid price increases and things like that. So I would say our order development continues to be healthy."

        "content": "Operator: Thank you for holding and welcome to Rockwell Automation's Quarterly Conference Call. I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jessica Kourakos, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Kourakos, please go ahead.\nJessica Kourakos: Thanks Rob. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts included in our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call. Additional information and news about our company can also be found on Rockwell's Investor Relations Twitter feed using the handles @investorsrok, that's @investorsrok. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So, with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake. \nBlake Moret: Thanks Jessica and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before providing detail on second quarter results, which were below our expectations, I want to provide general comments on the business environment. Through the first half of our fiscal ,year two themes stand out. The first is broad-based demand growth across industries, geographies, and offerings. Substantial backlog in all three business segments, low cancellation rates, and detailed component supply forecasts give us confidence that we will achieve double-digit revenue growth this fiscal year and reach $9 billion of profitable sales in the next couple of years. The second theme is persistent supply chain constraints and associated cost inflation, which put particular pressure on Q2 sales and earnings. Since our last earnings release in January, we've seen supplier push outs and de-commits for electronic component shipments, the impact of unexpected COVID-related shutdowns in China, and Russia started war in Ukraine. These have had an impact on our results and guidance. So, let's get into the detail on our quarter, the outlook, and what we are doing to maximize Rockwell's business performance and long-term value. Our second quarter results are summarized on slide three. Total orders grew by 37% ,once again reflecting very strong demand across our portfolio of core automation and digital transformation solutions. Total revenue grew 2% year-over-year in the quarter. Organic sales grew a little over 1% versus prior year, worse than our expectations due to the supply chain challenges. Through six months Rockwell's organic topline has grown 9% year-over-year. Orders momentum was broad-based across all three business segments. However, product shipments and solutions with significant hardware content were limited by multiple component shortages. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales declined 3% versus prior year, a sharp reversal from the 25% growth in the first quarter, reflecting volatile components supply. Within this segment's motion business, sales of our Independent Cart Technology grew strong double digits and our orders more than doubled from a year ago. Software & Control organic sales grew a little less than 1%, also reflecting component shortages. We continue to see strong order growth in this business led by logic and visualization. In Lifecycle Services, organic sales increased 11% versus the prior year, led by 24% growth at Sensia. Demand is broadly increasing in Lifecycle Services as demonstrated by a 1.34 book-to-bill. Information Solutions & Connected Services grew strong double digits in both orders and revenue. Industrial cybersecurity demand was strong in the quarter with orders up 90% year-over-year, as customers in life sciences, food and beverage, mining and many other end markets are increasingly relying on us to provide the robust network technology and real-time domain expertise to keep their critical operations secure and resilient. In the quarter, one of our Plex wins was with Reautomotive, an automotive technology company and EV platform maker headquartered in the EMEA region, where our cloud-native smart manufacturing platform will enable the state-of-the-art plan with real-time production monitoring, inventory and quality management, creating an agile manufacturing system needed for customized electric vehicles. You will recall that globalizing market access for Plex' software was an important synergy to be realized through this deal. Last month, Plex also became available on Microsoft's Azure Cloud in Europe and we're partnering with Microsoft to promote this new capability. At Fiix, we had another great quarter with ARR growing over 40%. We continue to win new logos including our first wins in Asia. Our partnership with PTC continues to grow and in the quarter, we booked software subscriptions for digital performance management based on ThingWorx. This new solution helps identify prioritize and act on debottlenecking opportunities that have the greatest potential P&L impact in manufacturing sites. We combine great technology and domain expertise to create a very strong value proposition for our customers. In the quarter, organic ARR grew by 17%. Let's turn to slide 4. Our usual Q2 end market performance slide is in the appendix. It's important to understand that this quarter, sales growth have declined in specific industry verticals is primarily based on the particular products being shipped into these verticals and the degree they were impacted by component shortages rather than underlying demand. Working left to right on the slide, auto and e-commerce, two very important verticals we serve within our discrete industry segment were down in the quarter with the resulting single-digit decline for the discrete segment. The majority of sales to these verticals are in products, which were heavily impacted by component shortages that impacted our ability to ship to these customers. In contrast, orders for auto and e-commerce remain very strong. We continue to see large competitive wins with our Independent Cart Technology for motion control and battery applications. And about a third of our total auto business is expected to be for electric vehicle applications in the full year. We also had an important sustainability win this quarter at Electra Battery Materials, a leading provider of low-carbon and sustainable metals to the EV automotive sector. Rockwell was chosen to provide a turnkey solution for North America's first integrated and environmentally sustainable battery materials plant. In e-commerce and warehouse automation, we continue to win expansion projects with our flexible material handling technology and digital twin software. And in semiconductor our offerings can be found in chip making machinery, material handling equipment and building management systems at the largest semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment companies in the world. It is clear we are playing a critical role in this industry's plans for multibillion dollar capacity expansion. We continue to see strong broad-based demand in food and beverage with particular focus on digital transformation projects. Life sciences sales were up double digits as two-thirds of our life sciences business is in software, solutions and services that are less dependent on electronic components. Oil and gas sales were up double digits led by improving trends in upstream and midstream. Our Sensia joint venture had strong orders and ships in the quarter and is expected to grow strong double digits for the year. In summary, multi-year capital investments across many end markets coupled with higher automation and digital transformation intensity have created high backlog and a continuing strong order funnel to support growth in each industry segment we serve. Turning now to Slide 5 and our Q2 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales declined by about 3% versus the prior year due to the higher mix of Intelligent Devices in this region. The Intelligent Devices segment was more heavily impacted by component shortages this quarter. We continue to expect more balanced sales growth across regions for the full year and expect North America to be the fastest-growing region in fiscal 2022. Latin America sales were up 13%. EMEA sales increased 6% and Asia Pacific grew 9% due in part to the higher solutions content in this region. In China, we saw high single-digit growth driven by strength in mass transit, life sciences, tire and oil and gas. Let's turn to Slide 6, which is a new slide we thought would be helpful this quarter. The high backlog, we've been building over the last few quarters and continued low cancellation rates, set the stage for strong revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2022 and beyond. We do expect lead times and backlog to stabilize over the next year. And at that point, orders and shipment levels will begin to converge, which is a good thing. In the near term, the primary limiting factor to growth is component availability. So as we turn to Slide 7, let's go a bit deeper into some of the actions we are taking to improve semiconductor, chip availability and our overall resiliency. We expect component shipments to increase in the coming quarters due to several factors. The first is improved material flow from key suppliers over the next couple of quarters. Where we are seeing improved flow from existing suppliers, several factors are contributing, such as the addition of incremental capacity, improved allocation percentages, opportunistic broker buys and some of these suppliers recovery from discrete events like fires and floods. We have also reengineered certain products to utilize components with better supply resiliency. For example, the new series of PanelView operator interface has enabled us to double the shipment quantity in the last two months. We have significantly accelerated our manufacturing capacity investments in our Twinsburg and Singapore facilities over the last year which will benefit production and resiliency in the second half of fiscal 2022. We continue to qualify new and additional semiconductor chip vendors, to create redundant sources for individual components and to diversify our supplier base and we expect to see the benefit in fiscal Q4. We continue to invest in diversifying our portfolio and see continued double-digit growth in our Information Solutions & Connected Services, which are less dependent on hardware supply chains. Price is also a meaningful contributor to our growth and our resiliency in mitigating inflation. We have very strong pricing power in the market, thanks to our highly differentiated offerings. We're seeing good price realization as annual customer agreements renew and we are taking action to get quicker realization of future price increases. In the last year, we have announced several price increases totaling 17%, materially benefiting the latter portion of this fiscal year and even more so in fiscal 2023. However, as you know there are risks that cannot yet be accurately quantified, which is one of the reasons, we have widened our range for growth expectations for the full year. These risks include the duration and potential escalation of the war in Ukraine. We have suspended the small amount of business we do in Russia and Belarus, less than half of 1% of total sales. We are seeing logistics cost increases due to higher energy costs as well as constrained and lengthened air freight lanes. Another source of risk is, the widespread shutdown of businesses in China due to COVID infection outbreaks. Our plants have partially reopened due to the critical role our products and services play in industries such as semiconductor, but the bigger risk is from upstream suppliers with operations in the area. We have built in some risk for China shutdowns, but it is difficult to quantify this risk in the next two quarters. Let's now turn to Slide 8, to review highlights for the full year outlook. Orders for the year are expected to approach $10 billion. At some point, we expect orders to moderate as lead times for our products return to more normal levels. However, orders are expected to remain well above pre-pandemic levels given the amount of capital projects underway in industries we serve. We continue to expect double-digit reported sales growth, but we've reduced the midpoint and widened the range in part given the volatility of component supply that we saw in the second quarter. April component supply and total sales are tracking well with our forecast. Acquisitions are expected to do well and contribute over two points of profitable growth. We continue to expect double-digit growth in both core automation as well as Information Solutions & Connected Services. We continue to expect another year of double-digit annual recurring revenue growth, which makes up over 8% of our total revenue. I'm pleased with the impact of both acquisitions and organic investments are having in these new lines of business. We have reduced our margin expectation and adjusted EPS target range for the year. The midpoint of the adjusted EPS range represents one point of increase over the prior year and a 13% increase without the impact of last year's lower tax rate and benefit from a one-time legal settlement. And as noted on the slide the Board authorized an additional $1 billion of share repurchases. Nick will now add detail to our Q2 results and our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. Nick?\nNick Gangestad: Thank you, Blake, and good morning everyone. I'll start on slide 9, second quarter key financial information. Second quarter reported sales were up 2% over last year. This is below our expectations and was directly linked to electronic component availability in the quarter. Q2 organic sales were up 1.3% and acquisitions contributed 2.3 points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by 1.8%. Segment operating margin was 15.7%, approximately 300 basis points worse than we expected and primarily impacted by lower-than-expected sales volume and higher input costs. Versus last year, our margins declined 630 basis points mostly due to negative price cost and higher investments in key growth areas. I will comment further on price cost on the next page. Our adjusted EPS in the quarter was $1.66 and 31% down from the prior year. As we said last quarter, we expect Q2 to be the most impacted by negative price cost as the benefits from prior price actions will be more heavily weighted to the second half of fiscal year 2022 and into fiscal year 2023. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter was 16% and in line with the prior year. Free cash flow was $46 million in the quarter and down compared to the prior year due to lower pre-tax income and higher income tax payments. Income tax payments were in line with our expectations and higher year-over-year due to the payments made in the current quarter in the US related to fiscal year 2021 discrete tax transactions. Free cash flow results were lower than expectations driven by lower pre-tax income and higher working capital as we continue to build our subassemblies for more rapid conversion into finished goods as we receive critical components. Turning to page 10. This is a new slide we added this quarter. This slide shows the actual impacts for quarter one and quarter two and what we included in our projections for the second half for both price and input costs. First on pricing. From our three price increases since last summer, we expect those actions to provide about $400 million of cost recovery once fully implemented. Less than 10% of this benefit was realized in the first half of fiscal year 2022. The ramp to achieve the pricing impact occurs, because much of our pricing is set by pricing agreements we have with our customers. Once we announce a price increase, these customers will not see the increases until their current annual agreements renew. We are implementing actions to accelerate realization on future price increases. The price growth projected here is only from previously announced price increases and factors in higher inflationary costs not yet seen. If inflation forecast for fiscal 2023 worsens more than expected we will take further price actions to offset these costs. On input costs, we did see a higher year-over-year and sequential increase in input costs in Q2. These increases were driven by increased logistics costs and a higher level of broker buys. We anticipate these elevated costs to continue increasing for the balance of the year. For fiscal 2022, we expect input costs to increase over $200 million, primarily due to higher electronic component costs and higher freight. On a net price cost basis, we are negative in the first half and positive in the second half. We now expect full year price cost to be slightly negative in fiscal 2022. Slide 11 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Total reported sales were up mid to high-single-digits in both our Software & Control and Lifecycle Services segments. Intelligent Devices was down 5% as this segment was impacted more by supply chain constraints. Intelligent Devices organic sales were down 3% in Q2 and up 10% in the first half. Compared to last year Intelligent Devices margins declined 920 basis points to 14.6% driven by negative price cost investment spend and lower volumes. This segment accounted for the vast majority of the miss to our internal expectations in both sales and margins. We expect the second half margins in this segment to expand by 200 to 300 basis points sequentially on higher volumes and higher price from earlier implemented price actions. Software & Control organic sales were up less than one point and 4% in the first half. Segment margins were up sequentially for this segment and declined 520 basis points compared to last year, mostly due to higher year-over-year investment spend, negative price/cost and the impact of acquisition integration costs. We expect the second half margins in this segment to expand by over 600 basis points sequentially on higher sales and higher price from implemented price actions. Lifecycle Services grew organic sales by 11% including more than 20% growth from Sensia. Demand remains strong across all businesses and end markets. Book-to-bill was 1.34 for Q2. Segment margin was up sequentially for this segment and declined 170 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by lower labor utilization caused by supply chain constraints, partially offset by higher sales volume and lower incentive compensation. Margin is expected to grow through the balance of the year with strong sales growth and a higher margin backlog. The next slide 12 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q2 fiscal 2021 to Q2 fiscal 2022. Starting on the left. Core performance was down about $0.75 on a 1.3% organic sales increase as we continue to make growth-related investments. We also were impacted by the timing of merit increases and lower labor utilization. As previously discussed price/cost had a negative $0.25 impact in the quarter. Given our updated guidance we lowered our estimate for fiscal year 2022 incentive compensation. On a year-over-year basis incentive compensation was about a $0.25 tailwind. This brings us to our total EPS of $1.66. Let's move on to the next Slide 13, guidance for fiscal 2022. We are updating our sales guidance to a new range of approximately $7.8 billion to $8 billion in fiscal 2022, up 11% to 15% for the year. We expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 10% to 14%. We expect currency translation to be a headwind of 1.5 points and about 2.5 points of growth coming from acquisitions. Our wider sales guidance range reflects the volatility we see in the component supply and uncertainty of the full impact of COVID-related shutdowns in China. As Blake mentioned earlier, we are forecasting an increase in sales in the second half in line with improved material flow from key suppliers. From a calendarization perspective, we are forecasting improved sequential performance over the balance of the year with a heavier weighting in Q4, driven by the resiliency actions Blake mentioned as well as the timing from higher price realization. We expect full year segment operating margin to be about 20%. This is a 150 basis point reduction from our prior guide and is the result of our volume decrease. The impact from higher input costs since our January guidance is expected to be more than offset with reduced spending levels including lower incentive compensation. We will continue to prioritize our growth and resiliency investments. We expect second half margins of around 22%, up four percentage points from first half levels, primarily driven from higher sales volume and a 250 basis point improvement from price cost. The first half impact of price cost and margins on a year-over-year basis was dilutive by approximately 250 basis points and the margin impact in the second half from price cost will be accretive by over 100 basis points. We expect margins to improve sequentially 300 to 400 basis points in the third quarter and another 400 to 500 basis points in the fourth quarter. We now expect full year core earnings conversion of between 20% and 25% with second half core conversion of approximately 40%. We continue to expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. We do not anticipate any material discrete items to impact tax in fiscal 2022. We are decreasing our adjusted EPS guidance range to $9.20 to $9.80. At the midpoint of the range, this is up about one point compared to the prior year. Finally, we expect free cash -- we expect full year fiscal 2022 free cash flow conversion of about 85% of adjusted income. The decrease from our prior guide of 90% is driven by higher working capital where we continue to have high inventory levels in order to support our increased demand. A few additional comments on fiscal 2022 guidance. Corporate and other expense is projected around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2022 is expected to be about $115 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 117 million shares. Finally, on capital deployment our capital allocation priorities for this year remain the same including our focus on deleveraging. As Blake mentioned earlier, the Board authorized another $1 billion of share repurchases. Board and management are committed to using our capital deployment framework to drive long-term share owner value including opportunities for increased share repurchases. Turning now to Page 14. This slide bridges the midpoint of our January adjusted EPS guidance range to the midpoint of our new range. Starting on to the midpoint of our new guidance. Starting on the left. There is a lower contribution from core operating performance due to the lower organic sales guidance partially offset by lower spend. We now expect price cost to be negative for the full year or a $0.25 negative impact versus our January guidance. Currency is expected to be a $0.20 headwind. Next, given the decrease in our forecasted performance, there is about a $0.35 impact from a projected lower bonus expense, which brings the new midpoint of the guidance range to $9.50. Although not on this page, we continue to expect our acquisitions including Plex to be about neutral this year including incremental interest expense or a year-over-year benefit of about $0.15. With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Nick. This was a tough quarter, but we are aggressively working to temper the impact of persistent and volatile supply chain shortages. We have provided guidance that reflects a detailed view of expected component availability and actions we are taking to increase the flow of product and solutions to the market. We are beginning to see increases in some of the semiconductors we use, we continue to qualify new sources and important new capacity is being built for the technology we use in many of our products. For example, the incremental fab capacity a major supplier is planning to bring online will directly benefit a number of our product families in early 2023. While we do not anticipate supply chain challenges to end soon, we do expect gradual sequential improvement over the coming quarters. I want to thank our suppliers for the recognition of the critical role we play in US manufacturing and industrial applications around the world. We are on track with our manufacturing capacity expansion to ensure that internal equipment and processes support our revenue growth in fiscal year '22 and beyond.  Despite these challenges we are also on offense. We continue to introduce new differentiated technology and services including the January opening of our Israeli Cybersecurity Operations Center to support worldwide customers. Later this year we will release new FactoryTalk, operator interface and design software at our annual automation fair.  We have reduced spending plans in response to the higher cost but we are prioritizing programs that will generate new revenue in the coming years and we are increasing investments that strengthen our resiliency. We continue to focus on accelerating profitable growth within the long-term financial framework that has served us and our investors well.  We complement internal investment with a disciplined capital allocation that is focused on creating value. The capabilities and dedication of our people continue to set us apart. From our manufacturing associates and plants around the world to our salespeople working together with supply chain professionals to meet our customers' most critical needs through our development engineers balancing the simultaneous demands of building component resiliency and launching new products to the teams who are focused on keeping our people safe and productive, we're confident that our extra effort will be remembered as we help manufacturers speed cloth protect and move the world. Jessica will now begin the Q&A session. \nJessica Kourakos: Operator you may begin Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Go ahead Rob. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. Your line is open. \nScott Davis: Good morning, everybody.\nBlake Moret: Good morning.\nScott Davis: I'm not going to fixate on the details of the quarter as much as talk about what do you think your customers do if we were to run into a recession? Is it a different playbook this time because they're so far behind on digital transformation? Do those projects continue? Do they get delayed? Do they stop and then restart down there? I mean how does it -- how do you guys think about how your customers act or respond if -- particularly on the consumer side if we do hit a recession? \nBlake Moret: Yes. Scott I'll make some comments and Nick may add to that as well. But we look at an industry-by-industry view of what the stated investments are in these different industries and what's likely to happen which of these are more at risk if we see the effects of inflation continuing to weigh on the economy and some of these macroeconomic events that have happened here in the last few months.  Certain of the big multiyear investments we think are going to be resilient through that. I'll start with semiconductor. With several hundred billion dollars of announced capacity expansions by these fabs and back-end suppliers I don't think that those are going to be thrown off track by the economic conditions and inflation because there's just such a need for that in the world as we are all seeing. So I think investments in semiconductor in electric vehicle as every company regardless of the current economic conditions is moving to produce vehicles that the world is looking for. Life sciences -- the continued demand for vaccines and other medicines. The digital transformation in food and beverage activities as people are trying to be more competitive and save cost. So as you look across the oil and gas, the high cost of oil and the need to pump more to be more efficient I think there's certain underlying secular trends that are driving that. To be sure in the cycle, we're seeing the impact of chip shortages and huge inflationary pressures. But I think these multiyear capacity expansion projects along with the enormous backlog that we and others have built up are going to create a little different dynamic than typical cyclical approaches. And then finally, we are happy with our position working with these customers who are really involved in the most important capacity expansion. So I think there's a good portion of the investment Scott that have been announced that are going to continue on because they have to meet the kind of demand that we're seeing in the world. \nScott Davis: Okay. Good color. I'll stick to one question. Thank you. Good luck.\nBlake Moret: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Your line is open. \nAndrew Obin: Hey, good morning.\nBlake Moret: Hi, Andrew. Good morning.\nAndrew Obin: Hi. Could you just talk about how it did sort of component availability progressed throughout the quarter? And what kind of visibility on your supply chain you have in terms of their ability to add capacity because we're sort of getting into this chicken and egg thing right? If you guys can ship your controllers to your customers I wonder how they can have add capacity if you can't provide them with controllers? So a that's my question. Thanks a lot.\nBlake Moret: Sure, Andrew. I mean it is an interesting dynamic. The circularity of what we're providing to capital equipment suppliers in semiconductor and directly to some of the big fab owners is dated to some extent by the availability of our equipment. So we're absolutely seeing how critical we are in these operations. I don't know that the general availability of existing suppliers changed a whole lot from month to month as we went through the quarter although we did see the early benefits of some of the reengineering that we have done with our products. I mentioned the PanelView and I think it's a good example because we now have redundant bills of material between the new and the old series PanelView that give us already significantly increased flow. And we see other reengineering efforts that will start coming online in Q3 and Q4. We have done a detailed product-by-product analysis of all the chips that go into those various products. As you can imagine with the breadth of SKUs we offer there's a highly diverse supplier base to this and that gives us the confidence in the guidance going forward, which do reflect more of our suppliers increasing their basic flow with incremental capacity expansions. Obviously, it takes a while for the brand-new greenfield capacity to come online. But between now and then, we are seeing increased flow for the reasons that I mentioned in my script. Nick?\nNick Gangestad : Hey, Andrew, specifically to the first part of your question, we\u2019ll head on month-to-month during the quarter. We saw some improvements in availability as the quarter went on with March being noticeably our largest month of the quarter of shipments out we were able to do.\nAndrew Obin: Thanks so much. Good luck.\nNick Gangestad : Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning.\nBlake Moret: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Hey, good morning. Just on price and price cost. So you're talking about the 17% price increase. $400 million is obviously 6%. Are you suggesting you expect some significant additional price, or is that kind of the normal leakage between kind of headline price announcements and what is realized? And also Nick you might have been going back and forth between sequential and year-over-year. But I thought you said cost is only going to be $200 million for the year. Maybe that was just an incremental number. But can you clarify that? Maybe just clarify the whole kind of price/cost equation for the year? \nNick Gangestad : Great. Yes. Thanks Jeff. From the three price increases that we put into place those impact the pricing that we have on our products. There are parts of our business such as Lifecycle Services that those general price increases don't apply to and those are done on a contract and -- and project-by-project basis. So that 17% and the ultimate yield of $400 million that applies to our price increases on our products that we're selling. And that $400 million that will progress through the -- through fiscal year 2022 and 2023. And by the late 2023 that fiscal year 2023 that's when we expect to be at the fully implemented at that annualized $400 million of price increase. As far as the cost impact. For the full fiscal year 2022 versus the input costs that we had in fiscal year 2021 that's what we're saying year-over-year is going to be a $200 million increase. Now we expect that to continue to go up from those input costs to continue to go up. That's why we put the price increases in that we've had in anticipation of further cost increases in the second half of 2022 and into 2023. If it turns out that our projections that we've underestimated the amount of input cost inflation we're prepared to act with another price increase if needed. But right now we believe we have some cushion in 2023 a little bit of cushion there. \nJeff Sprague: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi, Good morning, guys. \nA \u2013 Blake Moret: Good morning, Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: So just on your comment earlier Blake, you expect this order and revenue environment to sort of converge over the next year or so sort of implies the $9 billion is on the table before too long. I guess, what's your sense on the margin on that? And we've talked a little bit about price/cost but I'm wondering sort of what's the mix or kind of pricing level in that backlog and the confidence that this stuff starts to come out that you'll be pleased with the margins on that? And I guess, the context for that is I think last quarter you talked about some pretty decent pricing power and maybe still got a little surprised on price cost this quarter. So just trying to see how repriceable that backlog is today.\nA \u2013 Blake Moret: Yes. The majority of the backlog is in the higher-margin product as opposed to solutions. So the general quality of the backlog, with respect to the margin is good. Nick, kind of talked about the increasing benefits of price increases that we have already implemented and as customer agreements, come due for renewal over the coming quarters we'll see a steadily mounting benefit from those price increases. And as both of us have said, we're prepared to do more if necessary. So I think the margin is good. And as we see the growth, we also see in terms of absorption and so on that there's an actual impact that expands margins there. We remain committed to the long-term framework that we've talked about for the last few years in terms of conversion of incremental revenue and we're sizing the business to continue to show that commitment for good conversion. And as Nick said, the second half of the year we think will demonstrate that. \nJosh Pokrzywinski: Great. Thanks.\nA \u2013 Blake Moret: Thanks, Josh.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. That's a very clear guidance on the sort of the profit walk on price and cost. I just wanted to go to circle back to other pieces in that bridge, sort of incentive compensation and then investment spend. Maybe help us understand exactly what that new incentive comp tailwind is in pre-tax dollars, and also what the investment spend guided headwind is? I think it was $200 million headwind before for the year. What's the new number? And then, how much of those two factors boost the second half profits? Just trying to get to that kind of walk to those big margin increases in the back half. Any color around that -- those two items please? \nNick Gangestad: Julian, in terms of our incentive comp that I highlighted are what we often call our bonus. We started the year with a plan, that that would be $130 million. Given our reduced guidance expectation for the full year, we've reduced that from $130 million down to $80 million. That $50 million reduction from our original plan, is evenly balanced between first half and second half. In terms of investment spend, you're correct. We started the year saying, we expect investment spend to go up approximately $200 million, we now expect that \u2013 we scale that spending down to now instead of increasing $200 million to only increase approximately $100 million and that will be part of the benefit that we expect in margin in the second half of the year.\nJulian Mitchell: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Luecke from AllianceBernstein. Your line is open.\nBrendan Luecke: Good morning, all. Thanks for taking the question.\nBlake Moret: Good morning.\nBrendan Luecke: As you look at the last quarter here or the last couple of quarters, how are you thinking about your share position in North America, specifically and if you have a comment perhaps in other regions? Are there areas where you believe you're taking share for competitors or submarket segments where you're a bit more concerned?\nBlake Moret: Brendan we're \u2013 in a time as volatile as this we're looking over a period of multiple quarters as you suggest. And so that first half 9% shipments that is something that feels pretty good but even more importantly it's the kind of orders and the continued low cancellation rates that we're seeing in every region. And as we talked about North America, we'd see strong orders growth and we expect over the full year for North America to be our fastest-growing region. There's a lot of anecdotes of where we have won new business from new customers in different spots around the world and we're proud of those but I don't think it's too early to call some major new share gain movement in those areas. So we're continuing to bring the orders in do our best of shipping it out and then we'll take a look at where we are. But in terms of the order flow not only in North America but across the world in Asia, in Europe with both our core automation offerings as well as the new digital transformation solutions I'm very pleased with the new business that we're winning from competitively held accounts.\nBrendan Luecke: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is open\nAndy Kaplowitz: Blake, could you give us a little more color into what you're seeing in Lifecycle Services and Process Solutions in general? I think you mentioned the 1.34 book-to-bill in the segment which is good but it seems like a lot of the growth is concentrated in upstream oil and gas. How much leverage do you have to an uptick in midstream investment? Are you seeing movement in downstream projects at this point and \u2013 in mining, or is it really just component issues that are holding you back in those segments?\nBlake Moret: Sure. So in oil and gas our focus is on upstream and midstream. I would say there's a fair bit of activity particularly at our Sensia joint venture in terminals. And certainly a lot of people are talking about LNG but we had some good solutions there throughout our offering, especially in our power offering there. So midstream we are seeing good activity and good funnel. And what \u2013 and this goes back to my previous comment with Brendan, we're seeing some places where we're adding some of our new offerings on top of the core automation. So adding the software, adding some of the higher level of services on there as well, again through Sensia, but they're all about adding automation, closed-loop control even autonomous solutions in these operations. So it's really about the upstream and the midstream and the downstream refinery control is not a target application for us, but we're doing a lot of the balance of plant as well as the safety systems. And we did see some nice wins in the quarter with our safety offering as well. In mining, I think you asked about mining and we are seeing some increased activity there, particularly in Latin America, where we're seeing some of our strongest installed base and we're seeing some of that work come to life as well.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Thanks Blake.\nBlake Moret: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. Just so we get the you gave us some elements of the second half ramp up Nick. Kind of a couple of things. Number one given that the bulk of your sales in North America goes through distribution, why does it take so long to get pricing through channel? Just want to understand that. I think 85% 90% of your sales in North America go through channels. So, I just want to understand that dynamic. Then it seems like you implied 4Q is 320, 330 at the midpoint. Can you just confirm that's how you see the ramp up coming through? That would be helpful. Thanks.\nNick Gangestad: Nigel, I'll take the first part of that what you've calculated for the type of earnings in Q4 that's in the zone of what we're thinking to. You've interpreted that correctly. In terms of the elements that are driving our margin expansion in the second half of the year there's several things. First is -- and the biggest is the volume versus the first half of the year and versus last year that's the biggest. The flip we see on price costs moving to the positive is the second piece, and then the lowering of our spend is the third piece. Now, in particular, your question about price and the timing it takes for us to be getting the price that's -- it's really a function of what I talked about in my opening remarks about we have many of our customers on annual agreements. And when we announce a price increase, they do not see that price increase -- even if it's going through distribution, they do not see that price increase until their next annual agreement renews. So, that can create noticeable lags from the time we announce until we're actually realizing that increase. That Nigel is the primary thing even for things through distribution that caused that lag.\nBlake Moret: Yes. And if I could add to that Nick and I both talked about actions to speed the realization of price. And we are increasing the number of agreements that will not have to wait for that full lag period, until annual agreements renew at customers. We've done that in certain places. I wish, we had that in place a year ago, but it's going to benefit us going forward as we make those changes.\nNigel Coe: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open.\nNoah Kaye: Thanks for taking the question. In the past you provided some metrics around maybe some advanced ordering. You\u2019re talking about orders for the year approaching $10 billion still how much of this do you think is really pulled forward? And I guess, the second part of it is frankly if you didn't have these component shortages how much higher would the revenue be for the year?\nBlake Moret: Yeah. The vast majority of the orders that we are receiving are for current needs for customers. We have line of sight. Our distributors have line of sight to the projects and the machines they're trying to ship. I've been on the call with several dozen customers as we talked about what their needs are and their plans to expand and the impact on us with that. So the vast majority as we've been talking about is that underlying demand further backed up by the very low continuing cancellation rates there. And I think that, that continues as we go forward. A significant amount of that backlog with no component shortages would be shipping. So the order \u2013 the shipment levels would be much greater. But we also do see the impacts of long lead times on the orders as our customers MRP systems are automatically increasing the amount of orders that they're putting in. But it still \u2013 it represents underlying demand.\nOperator: And thank you for your questions. I will now turn the call back over to Ms. Kourakos for some closing remarks.\nJessica Kourakos: Thanks Rob. That concludes today's call. So thank you all for joining us.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Nick Gangestad",
            "content": "Thank you, Blake, and good morning everyone. I'll start on slide 9, second quarter key financial information. Second quarter reported sales were up 2% over last year. This is below our expectations and was directly linked to electronic component availability in the quarter. Q2 organic sales were up 1.3% and acquisitions contributed 2.3 points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by 1.8%. Segment operating margin was 15.7%, approximately 300 basis points worse than we expected and primarily impacted by lower-than-expected sales volume and higher input costs. Versus last year, our margins declined 630 basis points mostly due to negative price cost and higher investments in key growth areas. I will comment further on price cost on the next page. Our adjusted EPS in the quarter was $1.66 and 31% down from the prior year. As we said last quarter, we expect Q2 to be the most impacted by negative price cost as the benefits from prior price actions will be more heavily weighted to the second half of fiscal year 2022 and into fiscal year 2023. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter was 16% and in line with the prior year. Free cash flow was $46 million in the quarter and down compared to the prior year due to lower pre-tax income and higher income tax payments. Income tax payments were in line with our expectations and higher year-over-year due to the payments made in the current quarter in the US related to fiscal year 2021 discrete tax transactions. Free cash flow results were lower than expectations driven by lower pre-tax income and higher working capital as we continue to build our subassemblies for more rapid conversion into finished goods as we receive critical components. Turning to page 10. This is a new slide we added this quarter. This slide shows the actual impacts for quarter one and quarter two and what we included in our projections for the second half for both price and input costs. First on pricing. From our three price increases since last summer, we expect those actions to provide about $400 million of cost recovery once fully implemented. Less than 10% of this benefit was realized in the first half of fiscal year 2022. The ramp to achieve the pricing impact occurs, because much of our pricing is set by pricing agreements we have with our customers. Once we announce a price increase, these customers will not see the increases until their current annual agreements renew. We are implementing actions to accelerate realization on future price increases. The price growth projected here is only from previously announced price increases and factors in higher inflationary costs not yet seen. If inflation forecast for fiscal 2023 worsens more than expected we will take further price actions to offset these costs. On input costs, we did see a higher year-over-year and sequential increase in input costs in Q2. These increases were driven by increased logistics costs and a higher level of broker buys. We anticipate these elevated costs to continue increasing for the balance of the year. For fiscal 2022, we expect input costs to increase over $200 million, primarily due to higher electronic component costs and higher freight. On a net price cost basis, we are negative in the first half and positive in the second half. We now expect full year price cost to be slightly negative in fiscal 2022. Slide 11 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Total reported sales were up mid to high-single-digits in both our Software & Control and Lifecycle Services segments. Intelligent Devices was down 5% as this segment was impacted more by supply chain constraints. Intelligent Devices organic sales were down 3% in Q2 and up 10% in the first half. Compared to last year Intelligent Devices margins declined 920 basis points to 14.6% driven by negative price cost investment spend and lower volumes. This segment accounted for the vast majority of the miss to our internal expectations in both sales and margins. We expect the second half margins in this segment to expand by 200 to 300 basis points sequentially on higher volumes and higher price from earlier implemented price actions. Software & Control organic sales were up less than one point and 4% in the first half. Segment margins were up sequentially for this segment and declined 520 basis points compared to last year, mostly due to higher year-over-year investment spend, negative price/cost and the impact of acquisition integration costs. We expect the second half margins in this segment to expand by over 600 basis points sequentially on higher sales and higher price from implemented price actions. Lifecycle Services grew organic sales by 11% including more than 20% growth from Sensia. Demand remains strong across all businesses and end markets. Book-to-bill was 1.34 for Q2. Segment margin was up sequentially for this segment and declined 170 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by lower labor utilization caused by supply chain constraints, partially offset by higher sales volume and lower incentive compensation. Margin is expected to grow through the balance of the year with strong sales growth and a higher margin backlog. The next slide 12 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q2 fiscal 2021 to Q2 fiscal 2022. Starting on the left. Core performance was down about $0.75 on a 1.3% organic sales increase as we continue to make growth-related investments. We also were impacted by the timing of merit increases and lower labor utilization. As previously discussed price/cost had a negative $0.25 impact in the quarter. Given our updated guidance we lowered our estimate for fiscal year 2022 incentive compensation. On a year-over-year basis incentive compensation was about a $0.25 tailwind. This brings us to our total EPS of $1.66. Let's move on to the next Slide 13, guidance for fiscal 2022. We are updating our sales guidance to a new range of approximately $7.8 billion to $8 billion in fiscal 2022, up 11% to 15% for the year. We expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 10% to 14%. We expect currency translation to be a headwind of 1.5 points and about 2.5 points of growth coming from acquisitions. Our wider sales guidance range reflects the volatility we see in the component supply and uncertainty of the full impact of COVID-related shutdowns in China. As Blake mentioned earlier, we are forecasting an increase in sales in the second half in line with improved material flow from key suppliers. From a calendarization perspective, we are forecasting improved sequential performance over the balance of the year with a heavier weighting in Q4, driven by the resiliency actions Blake mentioned as well as the timing from higher price realization. We expect full year segment operating margin to be about 20%. This is a 150 basis point reduction from our prior guide and is the result of our volume decrease. The impact from higher input costs since our January guidance is expected to be more than offset with reduced spending levels including lower incentive compensation. We will continue to prioritize our growth and resiliency investments. We expect second half margins of around 22%, up four percentage points from first half levels, primarily driven from higher sales volume and a 250 basis point improvement from price cost. The first half impact of price cost and margins on a year-over-year basis was dilutive by approximately 250 basis points and the margin impact in the second half from price cost will be accretive by over 100 basis points. We expect margins to improve sequentially 300 to 400 basis points in the third quarter and another 400 to 500 basis points in the fourth quarter. We now expect full year core earnings conversion of between 20% and 25% with second half core conversion of approximately 40%. We continue to expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. We do not anticipate any material discrete items to impact tax in fiscal 2022. We are decreasing our adjusted EPS guidance range to $9.20 to $9.80. At the midpoint of the range, this is up about one point compared to the prior year. Finally, we expect free cash -- we expect full year fiscal 2022 free cash flow conversion of about 85% of adjusted income. The decrease from our prior guide of 90% is driven by higher working capital where we continue to have high inventory levels in order to support our increased demand. A few additional comments on fiscal 2022 guidance. Corporate and other expense is projected around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2022 is expected to be about $115 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 117 million shares. Finally, on capital deployment our capital allocation priorities for this year remain the same including our focus on deleveraging. As Blake mentioned earlier, the Board authorized another $1 billion of share repurchases. Board and management are committed to using our capital deployment framework to drive long-term share owner value including opportunities for increased share repurchases. Turning now to Page 14. This slide bridges the midpoint of our January adjusted EPS guidance range to the midpoint of our new range. Starting on to the midpoint of our new guidance. Starting on the left. There is a lower contribution from core operating performance due to the lower organic sales guidance partially offset by lower spend. We now expect price cost to be negative for the full year or a $0.25 negative impact versus our January guidance. Currency is expected to be a $0.20 headwind. Next, given the decrease in our forecasted performance, there is about a $0.35 impact from a projected lower bonus expense, which brings the new midpoint of the guidance range to $9.50. Although not on this page, we continue to expect our acquisitions including Plex to be about neutral this year including incremental interest expense or a year-over-year benefit of about $0.15. With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Hey, Andrew, specifically to the first part of your question, we'll head on month-to-month during the quarter. We saw some improvements in availability as the quarter went on with March being noticeably our largest month of the quarter of shipments out we were able to do. Thank you. Great. Yes. Thanks Jeff. From the three price increases that we put into place those impact the pricing that we have on our products. There are parts of our business such as Lifecycle Services that those general price increases don't apply to and those are done on a contract and -- and project-by-project basis. So that 17% and the ultimate yield of $400 million that applies to our price increases on our products that we're selling. And that $400 million that will progress through the -- through fiscal year 2022 and 2023. And by the late 2023 that fiscal year 2023 that's when we expect to be at the fully implemented at that annualized $400 million of price increase. As far as the cost impact. For the full fiscal year 2022 versus the input costs that we had in fiscal year 2021 that's what we're saying year-over-year is going to be a $200 million increase. Now we expect that to continue to go up from those input costs to continue to go up. That's why we put the price increases in that we've had in anticipation of further cost increases in the second half of 2022 and into 2023. If it turns out that our projections that we've underestimated the amount of input cost inflation we're prepared to act with another price increase if needed. But right now we believe we have some cushion in 2023 a little bit of cushion there. Julian, in terms of our incentive comp that I highlighted are what we often call our bonus. We started the year with a plan, that that would be $130 million. Given our reduced guidance expectation for the full year, we've reduced that from $130 million down to $80 million. That $50 million reduction from our original plan, is evenly balanced between first half and second half. In terms of investment spend, you're correct. We started the year saying, we expect investment spend to go up approximately $200 million, we now expect that \u2013 we scale that spending down to now instead of increasing $200 million to only increase approximately $100 million and that will be part of the benefit that we expect in margin in the second half of the year. Nigel, I'll take the first part of that what you've calculated for the type of earnings in Q4 that's in the zone of what we're thinking to. You've interpreted that correctly. In terms of the elements that are driving our margin expansion in the second half of the year there's several things. First is -- and the biggest is the volume versus the first half of the year and versus last year that's the biggest. The flip we see on price costs moving to the positive is the second piece, and then the lowering of our spend is the third piece. Now, in particular, your question about price and the timing it takes for us to be getting the price that's -- it's really a function of what I talked about in my opening remarks about we have many of our customers on annual agreements. And when we announce a price increase, they do not see that price increase -- even if it's going through distribution, they do not see that price increase until their next annual agreement renews. So, that can create noticeable lags from the time we announce until we're actually realizing that increase. That Nigel is the primary thing even for things through distribution that caused that lag."

            "content": "Thanks Jessica and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before providing detail on second quarter results, which were below our expectations, I want to provide general comments on the business environment. Through the first half of our fiscal ,year two themes stand out. The first is broad-based demand growth across industries, geographies, and offerings. Substantial backlog in all three business segments, low cancellation rates, and detailed component supply forecasts give us confidence that we will achieve double-digit revenue growth this fiscal year and reach $9 billion of profitable sales in the next couple of years. The second theme is persistent supply chain constraints and associated cost inflation, which put particular pressure on Q2 sales and earnings. Since our last earnings release in January, we've seen supplier push outs and de-commits for electronic component shipments, the impact of unexpected COVID-related shutdowns in China, and Russia started war in Ukraine. These have had an impact on our results and guidance. So, let's get into the detail on our quarter, the outlook, and what we are doing to maximize Rockwell's business performance and long-term value. Our second quarter results are summarized on slide three. Total orders grew by 37% ,once again reflecting very strong demand across our portfolio of core automation and digital transformation solutions. Total revenue grew 2% year-over-year in the quarter. Organic sales grew a little over 1% versus prior year, worse than our expectations due to the supply chain challenges. Through six months Rockwell's organic topline has grown 9% year-over-year. Orders momentum was broad-based across all three business segments. However, product shipments and solutions with significant hardware content were limited by multiple component shortages. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales declined 3% versus prior year, a sharp reversal from the 25% growth in the first quarter, reflecting volatile components supply. Within this segment's motion business, sales of our Independent Cart Technology grew strong double digits and our orders more than doubled from a year ago. Software & Control organic sales grew a little less than 1%, also reflecting component shortages. We continue to see strong order growth in this business led by logic and visualization. In Lifecycle Services, organic sales increased 11% versus the prior year, led by 24% growth at Sensia. Demand is broadly increasing in Lifecycle Services as demonstrated by a 1.34 book-to-bill. Information Solutions & Connected Services grew strong double digits in both orders and revenue. Industrial cybersecurity demand was strong in the quarter with orders up 90% year-over-year, as customers in life sciences, food and beverage, mining and many other end markets are increasingly relying on us to provide the robust network technology and real-time domain expertise to keep their critical operations secure and resilient. In the quarter, one of our Plex wins was with Reautomotive, an automotive technology company and EV platform maker headquartered in the EMEA region, where our cloud-native smart manufacturing platform will enable the state-of-the-art plan with real-time production monitoring, inventory and quality management, creating an agile manufacturing system needed for customized electric vehicles. You will recall that globalizing market access for Plex' software was an important synergy to be realized through this deal. Last month, Plex also became available on Microsoft's Azure Cloud in Europe and we're partnering with Microsoft to promote this new capability. At Fiix, we had another great quarter with ARR growing over 40%. We continue to win new logos including our first wins in Asia. Our partnership with PTC continues to grow and in the quarter, we booked software subscriptions for digital performance management based on ThingWorx. This new solution helps identify prioritize and act on debottlenecking opportunities that have the greatest potential P&L impact in manufacturing sites. We combine great technology and domain expertise to create a very strong value proposition for our customers. In the quarter, organic ARR grew by 17%. Let's turn to slide 4. Our usual Q2 end market performance slide is in the appendix. It's important to understand that this quarter, sales growth have declined in specific industry verticals is primarily based on the particular products being shipped into these verticals and the degree they were impacted by component shortages rather than underlying demand. Working left to right on the slide, auto and e-commerce, two very important verticals we serve within our discrete industry segment were down in the quarter with the resulting single-digit decline for the discrete segment. The majority of sales to these verticals are in products, which were heavily impacted by component shortages that impacted our ability to ship to these customers. In contrast, orders for auto and e-commerce remain very strong. We continue to see large competitive wins with our Independent Cart Technology for motion control and battery applications. And about a third of our total auto business is expected to be for electric vehicle applications in the full year. We also had an important sustainability win this quarter at Electra Battery Materials, a leading provider of low-carbon and sustainable metals to the EV automotive sector. Rockwell was chosen to provide a turnkey solution for North America's first integrated and environmentally sustainable battery materials plant. In e-commerce and warehouse automation, we continue to win expansion projects with our flexible material handling technology and digital twin software. And in semiconductor our offerings can be found in chip making machinery, material handling equipment and building management systems at the largest semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment companies in the world. It is clear we are playing a critical role in this industry's plans for multibillion dollar capacity expansion. We continue to see strong broad-based demand in food and beverage with particular focus on digital transformation projects. Life sciences sales were up double digits as two-thirds of our life sciences business is in software, solutions and services that are less dependent on electronic components. Oil and gas sales were up double digits led by improving trends in upstream and midstream. Our Sensia joint venture had strong orders and ships in the quarter and is expected to grow strong double digits for the year. In summary, multi-year capital investments across many end markets coupled with higher automation and digital transformation intensity have created high backlog and a continuing strong order funnel to support growth in each industry segment we serve. Turning now to Slide 5 and our Q2 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales declined by about 3% versus the prior year due to the higher mix of Intelligent Devices in this region. The Intelligent Devices segment was more heavily impacted by component shortages this quarter. We continue to expect more balanced sales growth across regions for the full year and expect North America to be the fastest-growing region in fiscal 2022. Latin America sales were up 13%. EMEA sales increased 6% and Asia Pacific grew 9% due in part to the higher solutions content in this region. In China, we saw high single-digit growth driven by strength in mass transit, life sciences, tire and oil and gas. Let's turn to Slide 6, which is a new slide we thought would be helpful this quarter. The high backlog, we've been building over the last few quarters and continued low cancellation rates, set the stage for strong revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2022 and beyond. We do expect lead times and backlog to stabilize over the next year. And at that point, orders and shipment levels will begin to converge, which is a good thing. In the near term, the primary limiting factor to growth is component availability. So as we turn to Slide 7, let's go a bit deeper into some of the actions we are taking to improve semiconductor, chip availability and our overall resiliency. We expect component shipments to increase in the coming quarters due to several factors. The first is improved material flow from key suppliers over the next couple of quarters. Where we are seeing improved flow from existing suppliers, several factors are contributing, such as the addition of incremental capacity, improved allocation percentages, opportunistic broker buys and some of these suppliers recovery from discrete events like fires and floods. We have also reengineered certain products to utilize components with better supply resiliency. For example, the new series of PanelView operator interface has enabled us to double the shipment quantity in the last two months. We have significantly accelerated our manufacturing capacity investments in our Twinsburg and Singapore facilities over the last year which will benefit production and resiliency in the second half of fiscal 2022. We continue to qualify new and additional semiconductor chip vendors, to create redundant sources for individual components and to diversify our supplier base and we expect to see the benefit in fiscal Q4. We continue to invest in diversifying our portfolio and see continued double-digit growth in our Information Solutions & Connected Services, which are less dependent on hardware supply chains. Price is also a meaningful contributor to our growth and our resiliency in mitigating inflation. We have very strong pricing power in the market, thanks to our highly differentiated offerings. We're seeing good price realization as annual customer agreements renew and we are taking action to get quicker realization of future price increases. In the last year, we have announced several price increases totaling 17%, materially benefiting the latter portion of this fiscal year and even more so in fiscal 2023. However, as you know there are risks that cannot yet be accurately quantified, which is one of the reasons, we have widened our range for growth expectations for the full year. These risks include the duration and potential escalation of the war in Ukraine. We have suspended the small amount of business we do in Russia and Belarus, less than half of 1% of total sales. We are seeing logistics cost increases due to higher energy costs as well as constrained and lengthened air freight lanes. Another source of risk is, the widespread shutdown of businesses in China due to COVID infection outbreaks. Our plants have partially reopened due to the critical role our products and services play in industries such as semiconductor, but the bigger risk is from upstream suppliers with operations in the area. We have built in some risk for China shutdowns, but it is difficult to quantify this risk in the next two quarters. Let's now turn to Slide 8, to review highlights for the full year outlook. Orders for the year are expected to approach $10 billion. At some point, we expect orders to moderate as lead times for our products return to more normal levels. However, orders are expected to remain well above pre-pandemic levels given the amount of capital projects underway in industries we serve. We continue to expect double-digit reported sales growth, but we've reduced the midpoint and widened the range in part given the volatility of component supply that we saw in the second quarter. April component supply and total sales are tracking well with our forecast. Acquisitions are expected to do well and contribute over two points of profitable growth. We continue to expect double-digit growth in both core automation as well as Information Solutions & Connected Services. We continue to expect another year of double-digit annual recurring revenue growth, which makes up over 8% of our total revenue. I'm pleased with the impact of both acquisitions and organic investments are having in these new lines of business. We have reduced our margin expectation and adjusted EPS target range for the year. The midpoint of the adjusted EPS range represents one point of increase over the prior year and a 13% increase without the impact of last year's lower tax rate and benefit from a one-time legal settlement. And as noted on the slide the Board authorized an additional $1 billion of share repurchases. Nick will now add detail to our Q2 results and our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. Nick? Thanks, Nick. This was a tough quarter, but we are aggressively working to temper the impact of persistent and volatile supply chain shortages. We have provided guidance that reflects a detailed view of expected component availability and actions we are taking to increase the flow of product and solutions to the market. We are beginning to see increases in some of the semiconductors we use, we continue to qualify new sources and important new capacity is being built for the technology we use in many of our products. For example, the incremental fab capacity a major supplier is planning to bring online will directly benefit a number of our product families in early 2023. While we do not anticipate supply chain challenges to end soon, we do expect gradual sequential improvement over the coming quarters. I want to thank our suppliers for the recognition of the critical role we play in US manufacturing and industrial applications around the world. We are on track with our manufacturing capacity expansion to ensure that internal equipment and processes support our revenue growth in fiscal year '22 and beyond.  Despite these challenges we are also on offense. We continue to introduce new differentiated technology and services including the January opening of our Israeli Cybersecurity Operations Center to support worldwide customers. Later this year we will release new FactoryTalk, operator interface and design software at our annual automation fair.  We have reduced spending plans in response to the higher cost but we are prioritizing programs that will generate new revenue in the coming years and we are increasing investments that strengthen our resiliency. We continue to focus on accelerating profitable growth within the long-term financial framework that has served us and our investors well.  We complement internal investment with a disciplined capital allocation that is focused on creating value. The capabilities and dedication of our people continue to set us apart. From our manufacturing associates and plants around the world to our salespeople working together with supply chain professionals to meet our customers' most critical needs through our development engineers balancing the simultaneous demands of building component resiliency and launching new products to the teams who are focused on keeping our people safe and productive, we're confident that our extra effort will be remembered as we help manufacturers speed cloth protect and move the world. Jessica will now begin the Q&A session. Good morning. Yes. Scott I'll make some comments and Nick may add to that as well. But we look at an industry-by-industry view of what the stated investments are in these different industries and what's likely to happen which of these are more at risk if we see the effects of inflation continuing to weigh on the economy and some of these macroeconomic events that have happened here in the last few months.  Certain of the big multiyear investments we think are going to be resilient through that. I'll start with semiconductor. With several hundred billion dollars of announced capacity expansions by these fabs and back-end suppliers I don't think that those are going to be thrown off track by the economic conditions and inflation because there's just such a need for that in the world as we are all seeing. So I think investments in semiconductor in electric vehicle as every company regardless of the current economic conditions is moving to produce vehicles that the world is looking for. Life sciences -- the continued demand for vaccines and other medicines. The digital transformation in food and beverage activities as people are trying to be more competitive and save cost. So as you look across the oil and gas, the high cost of oil and the need to pump more to be more efficient I think there's certain underlying secular trends that are driving that. To be sure in the cycle, we're seeing the impact of chip shortages and huge inflationary pressures. But I think these multiyear capacity expansion projects along with the enormous backlog that we and others have built up are going to create a little different dynamic than typical cyclical approaches. And then finally, we are happy with our position working with these customers who are really involved in the most important capacity expansion. So I think there's a good portion of the investment Scott that have been announced that are going to continue on because they have to meet the kind of demand that we're seeing in the world. Thanks. Hi, Andrew. Good morning. Sure, Andrew. I mean it is an interesting dynamic. The circularity of what we're providing to capital equipment suppliers in semiconductor and directly to some of the big fab owners is dated to some extent by the availability of our equipment. So we're absolutely seeing how critical we are in these operations. I don't know that the general availability of existing suppliers changed a whole lot from month to month as we went through the quarter although we did see the early benefits of some of the reengineering that we have done with our products. I mentioned the PanelView and I think it's a good example because we now have redundant bills of material between the new and the old series PanelView that give us already significantly increased flow. And we see other reengineering efforts that will start coming online in Q3 and Q4. We have done a detailed product-by-product analysis of all the chips that go into those various products. As you can imagine with the breadth of SKUs we offer there's a highly diverse supplier base to this and that gives us the confidence in the guidance going forward, which do reflect more of our suppliers increasing their basic flow with incremental capacity expansions. Obviously, it takes a while for the brand-new greenfield capacity to come online. But between now and then, we are seeing increased flow for the reasons that I mentioned in my script. Nick? Good morning, Jeff. Good morning. Brendan we're \u2013 in a time as volatile as this we're looking over a period of multiple quarters as you suggest. And so that first half 9% shipments that is something that feels pretty good but even more importantly it's the kind of orders and the continued low cancellation rates that we're seeing in every region. And as we talked about North America, we'd see strong orders growth and we expect over the full year for North America to be our fastest-growing region. There's a lot of anecdotes of where we have won new business from new customers in different spots around the world and we're proud of those but I don't think it's too early to call some major new share gain movement in those areas. So we're continuing to bring the orders in do our best of shipping it out and then we'll take a look at where we are. But in terms of the order flow not only in North America but across the world in Asia, in Europe with both our core automation offerings as well as the new digital transformation solutions I'm very pleased with the new business that we're winning from competitively held accounts. Sure. So in oil and gas our focus is on upstream and midstream. I would say there's a fair bit of activity particularly at our Sensia joint venture in terminals. And certainly a lot of people are talking about LNG but we had some good solutions there throughout our offering, especially in our power offering there. So midstream we are seeing good activity and good funnel. And what \u2013 and this goes back to my previous comment with Brendan, we're seeing some places where we're adding some of our new offerings on top of the core automation. So adding the software, adding some of the higher level of services on there as well, again through Sensia, but they're all about adding automation, closed-loop control even autonomous solutions in these operations. So it's really about the upstream and the midstream and the downstream refinery control is not a target application for us, but we're doing a lot of the balance of plant as well as the safety systems. And we did see some nice wins in the quarter with our safety offering as well. In mining, I think you asked about mining and we are seeing some increased activity there, particularly in Latin America, where we're seeing some of our strongest installed base and we're seeing some of that work come to life as well. Yes, thank you. Yes. And if I could add to that Nick and I both talked about actions to speed the realization of price. And we are increasing the number of agreements that will not have to wait for that full lag period, until annual agreements renew at customers. We've done that in certain places. I wish, we had that in place a year ago, but it's going to benefit us going forward as we make those changes. Yeah. The vast majority of the orders that we are receiving are for current needs for customers. We have line of sight. Our distributors have line of sight to the projects and the machines they're trying to ship. I've been on the call with several dozen customers as we talked about what their needs are and their plans to expand and the impact on us with that. So the vast majority as we've been talking about is that underlying demand further backed up by the very low continuing cancellation rates there. And I think that, that continues as we go forward. A significant amount of that backlog with no component shortages would be shipping. So the order \u2013 the shipment levels would be much greater. But we also do see the impacts of long lead times on the orders as our customers MRP systems are automatically increasing the amount of orders that they're putting in. But it still \u2013 it represents underlying demand."

Both the press release and charts include, and our call today will reference, non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today\u2019s call. Additional information and news about our company can also be found on Rockwell\u2019s investor relations twitter feed using the handle @InvestorsROK, that\u2019s @Investors R-O-K. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our Company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in our SEC filings. So with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Blake.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let\u2019s turn to our first quarter results on Slide 3. Total orders grew by more than 40% to over $2.5 billion, once again reflecting very strong demand across our portfolio of core automation and digital transformation solutions. Total revenue of $1.9 billion grew 19%. Organic sales grew 17% versus prior year, better than our expectations, despite significant supply chain challenges in the quarter. The manufacturing supply chain remains constrained due to extremely high levels of demand and persistent electronic component shortages. It\u2019s a very dynamic situation, and our global supply chain organization continues to navigate these challenges. We are taking a variety of actions, including qualifying additional semiconductor technology, and investing in capacity to increase our supply chain resiliency and support our growth. Turning now to our top line performance. Core automation sales and orders momentum was broad-based across our product lines, including Control, Visualization, Network, Motion, Power, Sensors and Safety. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales increased 26% versus prior year, even with significant headwinds from supply chain. Software & Control was also impacted by supply chain constraints, but organic sales growth of 8% was above our expectations. We also had very strong orders growth in the segment. Of note, industrial PC orders at ASEM, our recent acquisition, were particularly strong and almost doubled from a year ago. In Lifecycle Services, organic sales increased 10% versus the prior year, led by double-digit growth at Sensia and our Solutions business. Demand is strongly increasing in this segment, as demonstrated by double-digit sequential orders growth and a 1.38 book-to-bill for the segment. Information Solutions & Connected Services grew double digits in both orders and revenue. Q1 sales were particularly strong across the entire Information Solutions portfolio as well as Kalypso\u2019s digital consulting services. Industrial cybersecurity demand was strong in the quarter and included a strategic win with one of the world\u2019s leading natural gas pipeline companies in North America. We also had a key win with one of the largest Beverage manufacturers in EMEA, demonstrating how our industrial cyber business continues to create new ways for us to win. Our investments in the cloud are also showing very good traction. Another notable win in the quarter was with The Shyft Group, formerly known as Spartan Motors. The Shyft Group is a global leader in the commercial vehicle industry and a big beneficiary of EV and last mile delivery trends. Here, Plex\u2019s Smart Manufacturing Platform was chosen to enable best practices across their operations, reduce material costs, automate quality processes, all while supporting high-speed line deployments. At Fiix, we had another great quarter, with their ARR growing over 40% and over 600 new Fiix customers added in just the last 12 months. In the quarter, Rockwell expanded its presence within Lucid Motors, one of the top up-and-coming luxury EV companies in the world. Lucid had already selected Rockwell\u2019s FactoryTalk software to manage production and is growing the Fiix subscription base to ensure readiness and facilitate skilled resource effectiveness. This is a great example of the synergies we are already seeing across our cloud and on-prem software portfolios, and the positive contributions they are making to our overall business. I\u2019d also like to highlight the continued traction we see with our PTC partnership. The capabilities and versatility of the combined solution has contributed to our significant software portfolio differentiation and has become a great way to win with customers. In summary, I\u2019m very happy with how these digital offerings are contributing to our recurring revenue base, including contributions from our organically developed software, PTC, and our recent acquisitions. In the quarter, total ARR grew by over 50% and organic ARR grew double digits. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 4 where I\u2019ll provide a few highlights of our Q1 end-market performance. Each of our industry segments showed strong, double-digit, year-over-year organic growth. And as we\u2019ve said, our strong orders are reflective of underlying demand. Advance orders for longer lead time products that are not immediately needed made up about 10% of the total. In our Discrete industry segment, sales grew approximately 20% versus the prior year. Within this industry segment, Automotive sales grew mid-teens, led by a 50% increase in EV capital project activity around the world and strong growth in EV battery, led by our independent cart technology. Semiconductor sales grew over 25% in the quarter, with strong double-digit growth in all regions. Significant greenfield project activity is leading to our strong growth at semiconductor-focused engineering firms and machine builders. eCommerce was our fastest-growing vertical, with sales growing approximately 50% over the prior year. eCommerce orders included a series of multi-million dollar wins to automate new fulfillment centers throughout North America for a well-known eCommerce provider. We believe our strong differentiation in Motion, including advanced material handling technology, and support services are driving market share gains in this fast-growing vertical. Turning now to our Hybrid industry segment. The verticals in this segment also had a terrific quarter. Food and Beverage grew over 20% in Q1, with broad growth across the regions. Once again, SKU expansion, end-of-line automation, and the need for greater manufacturing flexibility are important trends requiring greater levels of automation. We believe the steady pipeline of greenfield and brownfield project opportunities, our deep relationships with machine builders, and our strong technology differentiation are driving record demand in this key vertical. Life Sciences sales grew over 10% in Q1, off of an extremely strong quarter last year and remains one of our fastest-growing verticals in fiscal 2022. We have significantly invested in this area of our business over the last few years and believe we are well-positioned to gain more share through broader and deeper offerings and expertise. Our fastest growing vertical in the Hybrid segment this quarter was Tire, which grew about 35% in the quarter. This is another great vertical that is investing heavily in innovation. Turning to Process, this industry segment grew approximately 15%, led by improving trends in upstream and midstream Oil and Gas. Our Sensia joint venture had strong sales and orders in the quarter, led by strength in process automation and lift control solutions. Sensia\u2019s digitalization solutions are well suited to the energy industry\u2019s desire to improve productivity and extend the useful life of existing infrastructure, as well as the desire to use modern technology to improve safety and reduce environmental impact. As operating and capital budgets increasingly open up, we believe Sensia is well-positioned for double-digit growth in fiscal 2022. Turning now to Slide 5 and our Q1 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales grew by 16% versus the prior year, with strong double-digit growth across all three industry segments. EMEA sales increased 15%, driven by strength in Food and Beverage and Tire and Metals. Asia-Pacific was our fastest growing region in Q1, growing 25%, with broad-based growth led by Semiconductor and Food and Beverage. In China, we saw double-digit growth driven by strength in Tire, Food and Beverage, Chemical, and Mass Transit. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 6 to review highlights for the full year outlook. We now expect orders for the year to exceed $9 billion, which is above what we expected just a few months ago and really taking our business to a whole new level. We continue to expect total reported sales growth of 17.5%, including 15.5% organic growth versus the prior year. Our projections reflect a detailed review of supply chain constraints by supplier and product line over the course of the year, but as we\u2019ve said before, these constraints remain very dynamic. We continue to expect double-digit growth in both Core Automation as well as Information Solutions and Connected Services. Acquisitions are off to a good start and expected to contribute two points of profitable top line growth. We are maintaining our margin expectation and adjusted EPS target of $10.80 for the year, which represents about 15% growth at the midpoint of the range compared to the prior year. I should add that we continue to expect another year of double-digit annual recurring revenue growth, including our recent Plex acquisition, which adds approximately $170 million to our ARR totals in fiscal 2022. A more detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 7. I won\u2019t go into the details on this slide, but as you can see, there is no change to the outlook for our three industry segments. With that, let me now turn it over to Nick, who will elaborate on our Q1 results and financial outlook for fiscal 2022. Nick?\nNick Gangestad: Thank you, Blake, and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll start on Slide 8, first quarter key financial information. First quarter reported sales were up 19% over last year. This is slightly better for the quarter than we expected and indicated in November. We saw some improvements in the timing of electronic component shipments from our suppliers that resulted in a stronger first quarter than we anticipated. Q1 organic sales were up 17% and acquisitions contributed 2.6 points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by under 1 point. Segment operating margin was 19.1%, better than expected and improved sequentially from Q4. Our stronger sales performance improved our margins in the quarter. Versus last year, our margins declined 70 basis points due to higher planned spend and negative price/cost, both in-line with expectations. These were both partially offset by the impact of higher sales. Corporate and other expense was $29 million. Our adjusted EPS in the quarter was $2.14. Q1 of fiscal year 2021 included a non-recurring favorable legal settlement of $0.45. Excluding the prior year favorable legal settlement, adjusted EPS grew 11% versus the prior year. I\u2019ll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 15.3% and in line with the prior year. Free cash flow was negative by $50 million in the quarter and down compared to prior year due to the payout of the fiscal 2021 bonus, an increase in our working capital to serve our strong demand, and higher planned tax payments. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased 151,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $49 million. On December 31, $503 million remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Total reported sales grew double digits across all three of our segments. Intelligent Devices grew organic sales by 26%. Compared to last year, Intelligent Devices margins expanded 430 basis points to 23.7%, on higher sales despite a price/cost headwind. Software & Control organic sales were up 8%. Segment margins for this segment declined 730 basis points compared to last year, with higher planned investment spend, and the impact of acquisition integration costs, partially offset by higher organic sales. This segment also saw negative price/cost in the quarter. Lifecycle Services grew organic sales by 10%. Segment margin was 5.5% and declined 340 basis points driven by higher planned investment spend, unfavorable project mix, and higher input costs, partially offset by higher sales. Margin is expected to grow through the balance of the year as a result of strong sales growth and a higher margin backlog. The next Slide 10, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q1 fiscal 2021 to Q1 fiscal 2022. Starting on the left. Core performance was up about $0.55 on a 16.8% organic sales increase. Approximately $0.20 was related to temporary pay actions that were benefiting the prior year and have since been reversed. This is the last quarter that we have this in our prior year comparables as a headwind. Currency was slightly unfavorable by about $0.05. Acquisitions had a negative impact of $0.10, mostly related to Plex. We continue to expect that Plex, including the impact of interest expense will be breakeven in fiscal year 2022 EPS and up $0.15 from fiscal year 2021. As a reminder, our prior year EPS included a non-recurring legal settlement gain of $0.45. This brings us to our total EPS of $2.14. Let\u2019s move on to the next Slide 11, guidance for fiscal 2022. We are reaffirming our sales guidance of about $8.2 billion in fiscal 2022, up 17.5% at the midpoint of the range. We expect organic sales growth to be in a range of 14% to 17%, and 15.5% at the midpoint of our range. This guidance is based on our current view of electronic component availability. By quarter, we see Q2 sales improving sequentially low to mid-single digits with continued improvement in the second half of the year. Our first half is expected to be in line with our initial projections with our first quarter being a little stronger and our second quarter coming in a little lower due to timing of electronic component availability. We are pleased with our supply chain team\u2019s ability to navigate through this dynamic environment and keep the focus on serving our customers. We expect full year segment operating margin to be about 21.5%. We continue to expect slightly positive price/cost for the full year. We expect the first half impact of price/cost on margins to be dilutive by approximately 200 basis points, and that the margin impact in the second half from price/cost will be accretive by over 100 basis points. Given the first half of the year negative impact of price/cost, we expect margins in the second quarter to be similar to Q1 margins, with the positive impact from higher sales being offset by higher sequential input costs. We expect the phasing of our price increases along with higher sales will significantly benefit margins in the second half of the year. Our full year view on margins and the impact of price/cost on those margins remains unchanged. We continue to expect full year core earnings conversion of between 30% and 35%. We are on track to grow our R&D and other growth-related investments by double digits. These investments will position us well as we drive sustained growth in 2022 and beyond. We continue to expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. We do not anticipate any material discrete items to impact tax in fiscal 2022. We are also reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance of $10.50 to $11.10. At the midpoint of the range, this represents 15% adjusted EPS growth. Finally, we are projecting full year fiscal 2022 free cash flow conversion of about 90% of adjusted income. This reflects a $155 million bonus payout made in quarter one for the fiscal 2021 performance, $165 million of capital expenditures and funding higher levels of working capital to support significantly higher sales growth. Our working capital target is aligned to our historical amount of about 12% of total sales. A few additional comments on fiscal 2022 guidance. Corporate and other expense remains around $125 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2022 is expected to be about $115 million, and we\u2019re assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 117.5 million shares. Finally, on capital deployment, no change to our strategy or fiscal 2022 priorities. Our first priority is organic growth. After that, we focus capital deployment on inorganic activities. Then we focus on capital returns to shareholders, through our dividend, and then share repurchases, and we continue to focus on delevering in fiscal year 2022. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Nick. Strong order trends and record backlog underpin a robust top line outlook for fiscal 2022. As we said last quarter, we are making investments in our capacity, technology, and people to support our future growth. We are investing in our operations to expand capacity by $500 million per quarter, while at the same time increasing the resiliency of our supply chains. We made significant progress in the quarter to release FactoryTalk SaaS offerings, including new Plex smart manufacturing platform capabilities, and we\u2019ve expanded FiiX\u2019s applied AI capabilities. We also released the next version of Emulate3D to further our capabilities in creating and operating digital twins of production systems. A significant release of new Logix functionality is scheduled for next quarter. Importantly, last year\u2019s accelerated organic investments have allowed us to release new secure remote access functionality and cloud-based data management of automation design information earlier than originally anticipated. In summary, Q1 was a great start to the year. We\u2019ve been very busy capitalizing on the opportunities we see today, while at the same time building for the future. I want to take a moment to recognize the people in our organization and the tremendous work that went into these results during especially challenging times. We are making significant investments in existing and new talent and are empowering them with the technologies and resources to be successful. We continue to encourage fresh ideas from across the organization and look at ways to increase our value through the customer\u2019s eyes. I feel confident that investments in automation and digital transformation have never been more top of mind than they are today. As a pure-play leader devoted exclusively to these areas, we think our agility, our differentiated portfolio of products and services, our significant domain expertise, and our ecosystem of best-in-class partners, make us the best positioned company to benefit from what should be a significant, multi-year growth cycle. Let me now pass the baton back to Jessica to begin the Q&A session.\nJessica Kourakos: Thanks, Blake. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Emma, let\u2019s take our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is now open.\nScott Davis: Hey, good morning, everybody.\nBlake Moret: Hey, Scott.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Davis: Good morning, everybody. But kind of \u2013 Blake, I wanted to ask about this Emulate3D, the digital twin stuff. Is that becoming the new kind of the standard to do a full kind of factory simulation digitally before you break ground? Is that becoming the norm? Or is that still kind of tip of the iceberg stuff?\nBlake Moret: I think \u2013 Scott, I think we\u2019re still climbing the adoption curve there. But everybody is aware of the promise of being able to simulate production systems before actually starting to run material through the line. And this is one of those areas that I think the pandemic accelerated, because you couldn\u2019t get everybody that you traditionally would have wanted to be on-site, shoulder to shoulder on a line commissioning a new line. And so the ability to go and to digitize your system to be able to tune it, to be able to get a good picture of what should happen takes you much further down the path without actually having to have people together and running product through a line in the traditional way. So we see the most advanced companies well into proofs of concept. We\u2019re heavily involved with them on that. And I should add, this is an area that the Kalypso acquisition and then followed by the more recent AVATA acquisition has really helped to complement the technology that we have with Emulate3D and some of the new Logix capabilities to have the people who can describe that holistically at the higher levels of the organization that are required to sign off on that sort of initiative has really been helpful for us.\nScott Davis: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Blake, historically, in the up cycle, you always have this unfavorable project mix, but there has got to be some supply and demand imbalances here, where supplying into these projects is going to be harder and harder just given how many projects there are. Is there a scenario that this cycle is a little bit different that you can price those projects and the bids more aggressively and have less of an unfavorable mix impact? Or is that just not how it works?\nBlake Moret: No. I think a couple of things. First of all, I do think that this cycle is going to be a little bit unusual. Now there\u2019s always some differences from one cycle to the next. But I think this one maybe a little bit elongated, because with the amount of longer-term capital investment in verticals wide semiconductor, where that new capacity is not going to come on for a while, where they still have to build an ecosystem of local partners around these big fabs. I think we could see a cycle that actually lasts a little bit longer than maybe that mean in the past. In terms of demand and being able to supply into this, right now, the bottleneck is the chips. We\u2019re working through that, but I still think that the material is getting out there and we are going to see the completion of these projects. I can\u2019t \u2013 I haven\u2019t seen any evidence that people are not moving forward with their expansion plans because of supply chain constraints. They\u2019re slowing them down, but everybody is trying to come out of the pandemic better positioned than their competitors in terms of capacity and new offerings, and I don\u2019t see that changing.\nScott Davis: Okay. Good luck, Blake. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Obin: Hi, guys. Good morning.\nBlake Moret: Hey, Andrew.\nNick Gangestad: Hey, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Just first question, you guys sort of said that first quarter was better than expected and second quarter was a little bit weaker. And I think you cited price/cost and supply constraints. I guess the question we\u2019re hearing is that for a lot of companies actually the fourth quarter seems to be a big pinch point and you guys managed to do better than expected in the fourth quarter. So what specifically, I\u2019m just trying to figure out how it is you were able to get stuff out of the door in your first fiscal quarter. And why would it get worse in the second quarter? Thank you.\nBlake Moret: So Andrew, we have a broad base of suppliers. Obviously, it goes well beyond just the semiconductor suppliers. But even within that category, we\u2019re managing a broad base of suppliers because virtually all of our Intelligent Devices are intelligent. They have semiconductor based technology. We are in daily contact with our key suppliers through our supply chain organization and conversations that include me and my senior team. And basically, we were able to get a few more chips in the first quarter than we had originally forecast, but we\u2019re expecting the second quarter to be a little bit lighter. It\u2019s a dynamic situation, but the fundamental, I guess, framework you should think about is that with the enormous backlog that we have the new incoming orders are coming in on top of that. So the demand is not the constraint, and we don\u2019t expect it to be for quite some time to come. Nick, anything to add to that?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. Our deal is what we were going to be getting for the first half of the year from for chips as our most significant component that just hasn\u2019t changed. Some of them came in a little earlier, and we were able to ship things out in the first quarter. The first half view of what we were going to get just did not change, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: No, that makes sense. And maybe a follow-up question on Software & Control. You highlighted high planned investment spend. Can you just \u2013 versus your expectation, I just wanted to figure out where was the margin on Software & Control versus your expectation for the quarter? And how much of this investment spend were planned? And how much of it was discretionary in the quarter? And what were you spending money on? Thank you so much.\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Andrew, it\u2019s \u2013 the Software & Control margins were actually just a little bit better than what we had in our internal planning. The investment spending is right in line with that total \u2013 for the total company, where, three months ago, we said that we\u2019d be upping our investment spend by approximately $200 million. Our first quarter, we executed exactly on that plan. It\u2019s roughly $50 million a quarter \u2013 over each quarter of last year that we\u2019re increasing. And that spending is as planned. We were also impacted in the margin in the first quarter by our continued spend on the acquisition integration costs. We expect that impact on the margin will diminish in the coming quarters as we work through the integration. So for the full year, Andrew, I know you didn\u2019t ask it quite this way, but we think the margins are going to continue to grow in Software & Control. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be of our total company margin expansion of 150 basis points, we largely think of Software & Control as largely flat compared to last year and the most of our margin expansion coming from Intelligent Device and Lifecycle Services. Now specifically, what we were spending on, we were spending on product development, software development in Software & Control. We also are spending more on our customer-facing selling resources and Software & Control is one piece of that as we are building more specialization in how we sell in some of the Software & Control products. So those are a couple of things that we\u2019ve increased our spending on. Blake will add a little more detail on that.\nBlake Moret: Yes. Andrew, just specifically in terms of the things within Software & Control, as we\u2019ve talked about, cloud-native software development in multiple products within the FactoryTalk Hub that we explored a little bit during Investor Day. There\u2019s also new visualization tools, hardware and software that are under development and then new hardware functionality around the Logix control system. We\u2019re going to have major new product releases in all three of those areas in the next 12 months.\nAndrew Obin: Thank you. This is super useful. And it was fun to hear Jim last night compliment you on your software growth as well. Thanks a lot.\nBlake Moret: Yes. Thank you. The PTC relationship is going well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nBlake Moret: Hey, Jeff.\nNick Gangestad: Hey, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Hey, good to catch up with everybody. And can we just delve a little bit more into the sequentials? And I know we touched on it a bit on the prior questions. But just thinking about margins being flat sequentially on higher revenues sequentially, is \u2013 so you addressed availability, but is price/cost actually worse in the second quarter also? Or is there something else going on in incentives or investment spend or something like that that would create that kind of lack of leverage on sequential revenue growth?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Jeff, in terms of price/cost, you\u2019re exactly right in what you\u2019re theorizing there. Price costs were negatively impacting us in the first quarter. They will even more negatively impact us in the second quarter, bringing that first half impact to that roughly 200 basis point negative impact on margin. Then from there, it starts to ascend the price/cost, and that will be getting substantially better in the third and fourth quarter on price/cost. And that\u2019s largely how we had this planned out at the beginning of the year when what we shared three months ago. I think the only dynamic that\u2019s been happening throughout \u2013 in the first three months is we are seeing costs go higher, and we\u2019re seeing our planned price actions go higher as well. So both of those moving in tandem to keep our net price/cost exactly what we said three months ago.\nJeff Sprague: And so the expected relief in the second half is a function of continued price mounting and kind of anniversarying? Are you baking in actually cost relief in the back half? Maybe you could discuss.\nNick Gangestad: No. I mean, of course, Jeff, that would be great to think that will happen, but we\u2019re not planning for cost relief. We are planning for continued cost inflation going in. It will be the price part and the phasing in of our pricing that will be positively impacting us in the second half of the year.\nJeff Sprague: And then could you also just separately address how to think about the orders? And the nature of my question is $9 billion of orders, 10% long lead time stuff. So let\u2019s call it 90% shorter-cycle orders, maybe you want to use a different term, but that would kind of imply a little over $8 billion in orders on the short-cycle deliverable stuff. That\u2019s sort of where your revenue guide is plus or minus a little bit. Is that the way to think about just kind of the reaction function here between orders and conversion to sales? Or I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a little bit more complicated than that. But just maybe frame up how orders convert to sales and maybe that\u2019s changing because of the supply chain and other disruptions that we\u2019re dealing with.\nBlake Moret: Yes. Jeff, the other main component, I\u2019d say, of the equation is the very large entering backlog that we have there. So these orders \u2013 continued orders growth comes on top of historic levels of backlog. And even the longer lead time orders, and I\u2019ll describe that a little bit, those will likely shift or a large part of that will shift in the fiscal year. So when we say longer lead time, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s pushed down beyond the end of fiscal 2022. To be sure, we\u2019re going to have very large backlog in any scenario at the end of fiscal 2022 setting up for fiscal 2023. But let me give an example of what those advanced orders would be. So you think of an OEM that has big backlog in their own shop of machines to be built, and they would typically buy, let\u2019s say, three months of components from Rockwell, controllers and drives and servo amplifiers and so on. Because of the longer lead times, they may extend that out to six months\u2019 worth of component orders that they\u2019re placing on us. So that\u2019s the example where they have the demand. It\u2019s not speculative they just increased their advanced orders in that respect. And we look carefully at both that customer demand as well as distributor order patterns. We\u2019re working closely with them, and that gives us the confidence to say that this is representative of underlying demand that goes right to the end user.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thanks for the color. I\u2019ll pass the baton.\nBlake Moret: Yes. Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hey, good morning, guys.\nBlake Moret: Hey, Josh.\nNick Gangestad: Hey, Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: So maybe just on the Intelligent Devices margins first. I know we\u2019ve covered some ground there. But anything that you can tell us, Nick, about was there kind of inventory preposition just waiting for chips or something else that kind of goose the margin with this first wave, like price/cost getting worse here in the second quarter? Is it really as common \u2013 I think across the industrial universe is because price has been so high. Like anything that sort of gave you the kind of initial advantage, yes, when you were able to get that extra supply in this quarter. That goes away? Or is it just inflation?\nNick Gangestad: The single biggest thing that was driving that margin expansion in the Intelligent Device \u2013 and we had high expectations for Intelligence Device margin as well in the first quarter. But what drove it even higher is the higher sales than what we were expecting. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m guiding that we\u2019re not planning margin expansion there in the total company sequentially because what we see for a bit of benefit from higher revenue in the second quarter as the low to mid-single digits I talked about, that will be largely offset by price/cost getting a little worse in the second quarter. Now what I would just describe in terms of our overall pricing philosophy here is we are seeking to price in a way to offset our input costs. And we\u2019re not pricing in a way to generate even more substantial profit after that but to largely offset the input cost inflation that we\u2019re seeing. We see opportunities for how we can be using our pricing to be gaining share around the world. And we are basically trying to offset it. That\u2019s why at three months ago now, we still see it slightly as a benefit to earnings per share but not a substantial difference there between input cost and price.\nBlake Moret: Yes. It\u2019s in line with the idea that we\u2019ve talked about of accelerating profitable growth, and we remain committed to the IDN or seeing this play out that nothing expands margins like top line growth. And so we think that we\u2019re striking a good balance between the near-term profitability and the investment to create an even brighter future.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow-up on Jeff\u2019s question on orders. Interesting, that stat on the longer lead time stuff is it really a big part of the equation sort of suggests that customers aren\u2019t ordering earlier to try and secure their spot in the line. So I guess that\u2019s a good thing, but like is the only thing that\u2019s sort of delaying kind of convergence of orders and sales on what should be a shorter cycle business, just supply chain? Or is there some other kind of delay in the process, labor or something on the customer\u2019s end that kind of prevents us from converging near-term?\nBlake Moret: Josh, it\u2019s supply chain constraints. We\u2019ve got this enormous demand that\u2019s a result, I think, of three basic things. First of all, it\u2019s the secular trends that you\u2019re seeing play out across industries and geography, placing a higher degree of importance on automation and digital transformation than ever before. So it\u2019s secular. It\u2019s also cyclical. We are still early in what we believe is going to be a multi-year period of economic expansion. And then finally, it\u2019s our position in this market. And I think all three of those things are driving the demand.\nNick Gangestad: Hey Josh, one thing I\u2019ll add is we\u2019ve invested in our own internal capacity that we do not see that as a constraint. So as Blake said, it\u2019s that component\u2019s availability and getting that, and we\u2019re equipped and ready to go for that as that ramps up.\nBlake Moret: Yes. And just a final point just to summarize, fiscal 2022 sales would be higher were it not for the supply chain constraints. So we\u2019re managing, as Nick said, our capacity, our labor based on very dynamic practices hand to hand around the world, making sure that we\u2019re acquiring talent, keeping talent, paying competitive wages, all those things, we\u2019re keeping ahead of it.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Great. Appreciate the color. Best of luck guys.\nBlake Moret: Yes. Thanks, Josh.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to circle back on the orders outlook again, so is the sort of assumption backing into that $9 billion-plus number for the year but you probably have a decent double-digit order growth year-on-year in Q2 and then maybe it\u2019s down year-on-year in the back half as supply chain conditions get easier but you\u2019ve got tougher comps as well. Is that the sort of the right way to think about orders over the balance of this year?\nNick Gangestad: Hey Julian, we \u2013 based on what we\u2019re seeing and what we\u2019re expecting, we do think we are going to see order growth in our second quarter year-on-year order growth. And then second half of the year, you can do the own math of calculating what that would mean \u2013 of what that means if we\u2019re at $9 billion. Like whether it\u2019s up year-on-year or down a little, I think that\u2019s a little too fine of a point. But what we\u2019re seeing in second quarter so far, we think that\u2019s in line with that, and we think it\u2019s going to be growth year-on-year.\nBlake Moret: Yes. The other point I would just add is we\u2019ve continued to see this order momentum for multiple quarters now. And the trends are extending into January. So we see it, again, as reflective of underlying demand in multiple industries, and we can point to the specific investments based on the large greenfields that have been announced as well as on the ground individual salespeople from distributors, from our own people who are directly involved in these projects. So we feel very good about the overall demand.\nJulian Mitchell: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then just my second question on the price cost aspect. So you mentioned some price \u2013 some extra price increases, but you\u2019ve left the organic sales guide in aggregate unchanged. So does that mean that pricing for the year as a whole is still not that different from that 2% type tailwind you\u2019d mentioned before? And then maybe just to clarify, when you talk about price cost, is that cost aspect solely sort of freight and logistics and components and labor is kind of separate from that?\nNick Gangestad: I\u2019m going to take the second part of the question first, Julian. When we talk and think about price cost, it is exactly what you\u2019re saying, what we\u2019re paying for all the inputs as well as logistics costs. Labor is something that we\u2019ve largely managed around productivity and what we\u2019re doing there to improve the efficiency and productivity of our operations often are incentive to more than offset what we see of wage inflation there. So when we talk input costs, we\u2019re in the cost \u2013 price cost deflation, its input costs and logistics. Now in terms of pricing and our overall guide, yes, we have chosen to keep our organic growth guide the same three months ago, when as I indicated a 2% \u2013 roughly 2% price growth that we were planning for the full year. We think that\u2019s going to go up. I\u2019m not going to put a new number on it because we \u2013 I mean it\u2019s a dynamic situation with price and cost, but we see that number going up. We\u2019re focusing more on the net, keeping those net in balance and what the two parts of that equation are. So we kept the guide the same. I think it\u2019s likely in one quarter from now with things like FX, things like price, we\u2019ll be incorporating all of that into the guidance.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Julian.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Luecke with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nBrendan Luecke: Good morning, all. Thanks for taking my question.\nBlake Moret: Hey Brendan.\nBrendan Luecke: As you talk to customers, are you seeing any early indications of shifting manufacturing footprints sort of on the back of the extended supply chain crisis? Or is this really more of a CapEx recovery story and share gain when you look at your growth projections?\nBlake Moret: I think its new investment. I would not look at it as shifting manufacturing, although I think manufacturing in North America is probably a larger percentage of a company\u2019s global investment than it has been traditionally. So I don\u2019t see people closing plants in Asia, for instance, and bringing them back as the majority of what\u2019s driving the demand. But I do see, as people are planning new capacity, whether it\u2019s brownfields or greenfields or upgrades adding digitization solutions to existing capacity. I see North America, and that obviously is our strongest market, as being an outsized beneficiary. So automation, in general, as I said before, from a secular standpoint is increasing. Then in the cycle, it\u2019s still early. And our position in high growth, high investment areas of both geography and technology are positive in what are driving a lot of this outlook.\nBrendan Luecke: Excellent. Thank you.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Brendan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nSteve Tusa: Hey guys, good morning.\nBlake Moret: Hey, Steve.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Congrats on good execution here, kind of above seasonal. So it looks like you guys shoot through a little bit of that backlog at least. I just wanted to make that clear on the comments you just made. You\u2019re guiding Forex at zero. I think you\u2019ll have a headwind. If you snap the line today, what\u2019s that headwind on Forex, I would assume that, that would be a headwind for the year.\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Steve. We \u2013 if I snapped the line earlier this week, it would be between a 1% and 2% negative impact. We chose \u2013 I chose not to be updating because it\u2019s volatile and we have enough volatility. I didn\u2019t want to be updating for just one component and not updating for all. So we have FX that\u2019s if I snap the top line right now, a little bit worse than our initial guide. We have price that is better than our initial guidance, and we have input costs that are higher than our initial guide. All in, we think that leads to an aggregate where we think our top line growth and EPS growth that we said three months ago still make the most sense.\nSteve Tusa: Right, right, right. Okay. Got it. And then how much \u2013 I have like $35 million for Plex revenues in the quarter. And then what were orders for Plex side \u2013 is there some sort of deferred revenue kind of booking dynamic there? I\u2019m not a software guy. So I feel like every time our companies do a software deal, there\u2019s like a bunch of orders that flow through in the first quarter. Can you just talk to revenues and orders at Plex?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. Your numbers on Plex are just in terms of revenue, that\u2019s exactly where they were. Orders were substantially higher. My ballpark looking at it is about 20% higher than what our revenue was.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. It\u2019s kind of huge number thought it\u2019s not like you didn\u2019t rebook anything there in orders for them.\nBlake Moret: No. There is no \u2013\nNick Gangestad: No, no, no. Yes.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And then just one last one on kind of the back half of the year, and anything to talk about as far as just keep in mind for third or fourth \u2013 third and fourth quarter dynamics?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. I mean the biggest two things, Steve, or what I\u2019ve already talked about, in terms of revenue, we see continued sequential improvement as we are estimating and improved access to electronic components as we progress into our second half. In terms of margin and profitability, the single biggest dynamic is \u2013 that\u2019s going to be driving the margin up is the flip on price costs from negative to positive in the second half. And then also benefiting the second half is the improved leverage with the added sales that we\u2019d be having. That\u2019s the biggest dynamics going on in the second half. There isn\u2019t a another big thing going on there.\nBlake Moret: Yes. And I would just say continued very strong backlog. So just a simple math of what we shipped and what we booked indicates the backlog remains and even grows. So that remains healthy.\nSteve Tusa: Awesome. Thanks for all the details. Appreciate it.\nBlake Moret: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, guys.\nBlake Moret: Hey, Andy.\nNick Gangestad: Hey.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Blake, you mentioned China strong double digits in Q1 and Asia-Pacific actually led your global growth. I know you still have easy comparisons in the Asia-Pacific, but I think you\u2019ve been talking about changing the way you go to market there and you\u2019re making investments in the region. So is Q1 results \u2013 is Q1 a result of those efforts? And then obviously, there seems to be some macro risk in the region. So could you give us a little more color into what you\u2019re seeing there?\nBlake Moret: Sure. Just specifically on China, if we look at the verticals that contributed to that strong double-digit growth, there was a Tire, which, in general, of course, continues to be a great vertical, and there\u2019s a lot of tire activity complementing the EV activity going on in China, and we\u2019re a beneficiary of that. Food and Beverage is an area where that worldwide is our single biggest vertical. And we\u2019ve had some great recent traction within China in Food and Beverage, Chemical and then Mass Transit. So these are industries that have generally been pretty good for us in China. And when I talk about new ways to get to market, it\u2019s really complementing our traditional distribution. But we\u2019ve also given our local leadership more empowerment to make investments that they say are appropriate with our relatively lower share in China. We think by doing basic things correctly, there\u2019s lots of room to run. And it\u2019s a combination of our core products as well as the new ways to win, Information Solutions & Connected Services. And those are really seen as a calling card getting into customers even when their installed base might be with competitive product, it\u2019s a way for engaging high level decision makers as we bring that new value to them. And those companies across Food and Beverage and Life Sciences and EV, they\u2019re all intensely interested in climbing the productivity curve fast. And so that\u2019s where we see particular endorsement of our software, which is a strong contributor in China as well as new disruptive technology like independent card, which we continue to win some very large orders in China based on independent card, particularly in EV and battery assembly.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Thanks for that, Blake. And then, Nick, I know you didn\u2019t change your overall sales growth forecast. I mean, if I look, though, at the pieces of the end markets, it looks like you\u2019ve raised a little bit e-commerce, life sciences, oil and gas, you lowered chemicals. So if you sort of put that all together, I think last quarter, you told us that even with supply chain issues, you still \u2013 you felt relatively confident about your range even at the high end. Does the sort of implicit changes in these end markets that you made here this quarter suggest that you might even have more confidence, especially given the orders that you just recorded in Q1?\nNick Gangestad: We \u2013 Andy, we remain confident that we\u2019re guiding exactly where we think it will be, but those small things that you\u2019re talking about, those are like more on the fringe that we think our guidance is based far less of a view of demand and far more by what we see of our ability to be procuring components and that view has not changed, and we continue to think where we\u2019re guiding is exactly what we\u2019re going to be able to deliver this year.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Thanks, guys.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Andy.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Ms. Kourakos, I turn the call back to you.\nJessica Kourakos: Thanks, Emma. Thanks, everyone. That concludes today\u2019s call. We appreciate your support and look forward to talking to you soon. Have a great day.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s conference call. At this time, you may disconnect. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nick Gangestad",
            "content": "Thank you, Blake, and good morning everyone. I'll start on Slide 8, first quarter key financial information. First quarter reported sales were up 19% over last year. This is slightly better for the quarter than we expected and indicated in November. We saw some improvements in the timing of electronic component shipments from our suppliers that resulted in a stronger first quarter than we anticipated. Q1 organic sales were up 17% and acquisitions contributed 2.6 points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by under 1 point. Segment operating margin was 19.1%, better than expected and improved sequentially from Q4. Our stronger sales performance improved our margins in the quarter. Versus last year, our margins declined 70 basis points due to higher planned spend and negative price/cost, both in-line with expectations. These were both partially offset by the impact of higher sales. Corporate and other expense was $29 million. Our adjusted EPS in the quarter was $2.14. Q1 of fiscal year 2021 included a non-recurring favorable legal settlement of $0.45. Excluding the prior year favorable legal settlement, adjusted EPS grew 11% versus the prior year. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 15.3% and in line with the prior year. Free cash flow was negative by $50 million in the quarter and down compared to prior year due to the payout of the fiscal 2021 bonus, an increase in our working capital to serve our strong demand, and higher planned tax payments. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased 151,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $49 million. On December 31, $503 million remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Total reported sales grew double digits across all three of our segments. Intelligent Devices grew organic sales by 26%. Compared to last year, Intelligent Devices margins expanded 430 basis points to 23.7%, on higher sales despite a price/cost headwind. Software & Control organic sales were up 8%. Segment margins for this segment declined 730 basis points compared to last year, with higher planned investment spend, and the impact of acquisition integration costs, partially offset by higher organic sales. This segment also saw negative price/cost in the quarter. Lifecycle Services grew organic sales by 10%. Segment margin was 5.5% and declined 340 basis points driven by higher planned investment spend, unfavorable project mix, and higher input costs, partially offset by higher sales. Margin is expected to grow through the balance of the year as a result of strong sales growth and a higher margin backlog. The next Slide 10, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q1 fiscal 2021 to Q1 fiscal 2022. Starting on the left. Core performance was up about $0.55 on a 16.8% organic sales increase. Approximately $0.20 was related to temporary pay actions that were benefiting the prior year and have since been reversed. This is the last quarter that we have this in our prior year comparables as a headwind. Currency was slightly unfavorable by about $0.05. Acquisitions had a negative impact of $0.10, mostly related to Plex. We continue to expect that Plex, including the impact of interest expense will be breakeven in fiscal year 2022 EPS and up $0.15 from fiscal year 2021. As a reminder, our prior year EPS included a non-recurring legal settlement gain of $0.45. This brings us to our total EPS of $2.14. Let's move on to the next Slide 11, guidance for fiscal 2022. We are reaffirming our sales guidance of about $8.2 billion in fiscal 2022, up 17.5% at the midpoint of the range. We expect organic sales growth to be in a range of 14% to 17%, and 15.5% at the midpoint of our range. This guidance is based on our current view of electronic component availability. By quarter, we see Q2 sales improving sequentially low to mid-single digits with continued improvement in the second half of the year. Our first half is expected to be in line with our initial projections with our first quarter being a little stronger and our second quarter coming in a little lower due to timing of electronic component availability. We are pleased with our supply chain team's ability to navigate through this dynamic environment and keep the focus on serving our customers. We expect full year segment operating margin to be about 21.5%. We continue to expect slightly positive price/cost for the full year. We expect the first half impact of price/cost on margins to be dilutive by approximately 200 basis points, and that the margin impact in the second half from price/cost will be accretive by over 100 basis points. Given the first half of the year negative impact of price/cost, we expect margins in the second quarter to be similar to Q1 margins, with the positive impact from higher sales being offset by higher sequential input costs. We expect the phasing of our price increases along with higher sales will significantly benefit margins in the second half of the year. Our full year view on margins and the impact of price/cost on those margins remains unchanged. We continue to expect full year core earnings conversion of between 30% and 35%. We are on track to grow our R&D and other growth-related investments by double digits. These investments will position us well as we drive sustained growth in 2022 and beyond. We continue to expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. We do not anticipate any material discrete items to impact tax in fiscal 2022. We are also reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance of $10.50 to $11.10. At the midpoint of the range, this represents 15% adjusted EPS growth. Finally, we are projecting full year fiscal 2022 free cash flow conversion of about 90% of adjusted income. This reflects a $155 million bonus payout made in quarter one for the fiscal 2021 performance, $165 million of capital expenditures and funding higher levels of working capital to support significantly higher sales growth. Our working capital target is aligned to our historical amount of about 12% of total sales. A few additional comments on fiscal 2022 guidance. Corporate and other expense remains around $125 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2022 is expected to be about $115 million, and we're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 117.5 million shares. Finally, on capital deployment, no change to our strategy or fiscal 2022 priorities. Our first priority is organic growth. After that, we focus capital deployment on inorganic activities. Then we focus on capital returns to shareholders, through our dividend, and then share repurchases, and we continue to focus on delevering in fiscal year 2022. With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Good morning, Scott. Hey, Andrew. Yes. Our deal is what we were going to be getting for the first half of the year from for chips as our most significant component that just hasn't changed. Some of them came in a little earlier, and we were able to ship things out in the first quarter. The first half view of what we were going to get just did not change, Andrew. Yes, Andrew, it's \u2013 the Software & Control margins were actually just a little bit better than what we had in our internal planning. The investment spending is right in line with that total \u2013 for the total company, where, three months ago, we said that we'd be upping our investment spend by approximately $200 million. Our first quarter, we executed exactly on that plan. It's roughly $50 million a quarter \u2013 over each quarter of last year that we're increasing. And that spending is as planned. We were also impacted in the margin in the first quarter by our continued spend on the acquisition integration costs. We expect that impact on the margin will diminish in the coming quarters as we work through the integration. So for the full year, Andrew, I know you didn't ask it quite this way, but we think the margins are going to continue to grow in Software & Control. We don't think it's going to be of our total company margin expansion of 150 basis points, we largely think of Software & Control as largely flat compared to last year and the most of our margin expansion coming from Intelligent Device and Lifecycle Services. Now specifically, what we were spending on, we were spending on product development, software development in Software & Control. We also are spending more on our customer-facing selling resources and Software & Control is one piece of that as we are building more specialization in how we sell in some of the Software & Control products. So those are a couple of things that we've increased our spending on. Blake will add a little more detail on that. Hey, Jeff. Yes, Jeff, in terms of price/cost, you're exactly right in what you're theorizing there. Price costs were negatively impacting us in the first quarter. They will even more negatively impact us in the second quarter, bringing that first half impact to that roughly 200 basis point negative impact on margin. Then from there, it starts to ascend the price/cost, and that will be getting substantially better in the third and fourth quarter on price/cost. And that's largely how we had this planned out at the beginning of the year when what we shared three months ago. I think the only dynamic that's been happening throughout \u2013 in the first three months is we are seeing costs go higher, and we're seeing our planned price actions go higher as well. So both of those moving in tandem to keep our net price/cost exactly what we said three months ago. No. I mean, of course, Jeff, that would be great to think that will happen, but we're not planning for cost relief. We are planning for continued cost inflation going in. It will be the price part and the phasing in of our pricing that will be positively impacting us in the second half of the year. Hey, Josh. The single biggest thing that was driving that margin expansion in the Intelligent Device \u2013 and we had high expectations for Intelligence Device margin as well in the first quarter. But what drove it even higher is the higher sales than what we were expecting. And that's why I'm guiding that we're not planning margin expansion there in the total company sequentially because what we see for a bit of benefit from higher revenue in the second quarter as the low to mid-single digits I talked about, that will be largely offset by price/cost getting a little worse in the second quarter. Now what I would just describe in terms of our overall pricing philosophy here is we are seeking to price in a way to offset our input costs. And we're not pricing in a way to generate even more substantial profit after that but to largely offset the input cost inflation that we're seeing. We see opportunities for how we can be using our pricing to be gaining share around the world. And we are basically trying to offset it. That's why at three months ago now, we still see it slightly as a benefit to earnings per share but not a substantial difference there between input cost and price. Hey Josh, one thing I'll add is we've invested in our own internal capacity that we do not see that as a constraint. So as Blake said, it's that component's availability and getting that, and we're equipped and ready to go for that as that ramps up. Hey Julian, we \u2013 based on what we're seeing and what we're expecting, we do think we are going to see order growth in our second quarter year-on-year order growth. And then second half of the year, you can do the own math of calculating what that would mean \u2013 of what that means if we're at $9 billion. Like whether it's up year-on-year or down a little, I think that's a little too fine of a point. But what we're seeing in second quarter so far, we think that's in line with that, and we think it's going to be growth year-on-year. I'm going to take the second part of the question first, Julian. When we talk and think about price cost, it is exactly what you're saying, what we're paying for all the inputs as well as logistics costs. Labor is something that we've largely managed around productivity and what we're doing there to improve the efficiency and productivity of our operations often are incentive to more than offset what we see of wage inflation there. So when we talk input costs, we're in the cost \u2013 price cost deflation, its input costs and logistics. Now in terms of pricing and our overall guide, yes, we have chosen to keep our organic growth guide the same three months ago, when as I indicated a 2% \u2013 roughly 2% price growth that we were planning for the full year. We think that's going to go up. I'm not going to put a new number on it because we \u2013 I mean it's a dynamic situation with price and cost, but we see that number going up. We're focusing more on the net, keeping those net in balance and what the two parts of that equation are. So we kept the guide the same. I think it's likely in one quarter from now with things like FX, things like price, we'll be incorporating all of that into the guidance. Good morning, Steve. Yes, Steve. We \u2013 if I snapped the line earlier this week, it would be between a 1% and 2% negative impact. We chose \u2013 I chose not to be updating because it's volatile and we have enough volatility. I didn't want to be updating for just one component and not updating for all. So we have FX that's if I snap the top line right now, a little bit worse than our initial guide. We have price that is better than our initial guidance, and we have input costs that are higher than our initial guide. All in, we think that leads to an aggregate where we think our top line growth and EPS growth that we said three months ago still make the most sense. Yes. Your numbers on Plex are just in terms of revenue, that's exactly where they were. Orders were substantially higher. My ballpark looking at it is about 20% higher than what our revenue was. No, no, no. Yes. Yes. I mean the biggest two things, Steve, or what I've already talked about, in terms of revenue, we see continued sequential improvement as we are estimating and improved access to electronic components as we progress into our second half. In terms of margin and profitability, the single biggest dynamic is \u2013 that's going to be driving the margin up is the flip on price costs from negative to positive in the second half. And then also benefiting the second half is the improved leverage with the added sales that we'd be having. That's the biggest dynamics going on in the second half. There isn't a another big thing going on there. Hey. We \u2013 Andy, we remain confident that we're guiding exactly where we think it will be, but those small things that you're talking about, those are like more on the fringe that we think our guidance is based far less of a view of demand and far more by what we see of our ability to be procuring components and that view has not changed, and we continue to think where we're guiding is exactly what we're going to be able to deliver this year."

            "name": "Blake Moret",
            "content": "Thanks, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our first quarter results on Slide 3. Total orders grew by more than 40% to over $2.5 billion, once again reflecting very strong demand across our portfolio of core automation and digital transformation solutions. Total revenue of $1.9 billion grew 19%. Organic sales grew 17% versus prior year, better than our expectations, despite significant supply chain challenges in the quarter. The manufacturing supply chain remains constrained due to extremely high levels of demand and persistent electronic component shortages. It's a very dynamic situation, and our global supply chain organization continues to navigate these challenges. We are taking a variety of actions, including qualifying additional semiconductor technology, and investing in capacity to increase our supply chain resiliency and support our growth. Turning now to our top line performance. Core automation sales and orders momentum was broad-based across our product lines, including Control, Visualization, Network, Motion, Power, Sensors and Safety. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales increased 26% versus prior year, even with significant headwinds from supply chain. Software & Control was also impacted by supply chain constraints, but organic sales growth of 8% was above our expectations. We also had very strong orders growth in the segment. Of note, industrial PC orders at ASEM, our recent acquisition, were particularly strong and almost doubled from a year ago. In Lifecycle Services, organic sales increased 10% versus the prior year, led by double-digit growth at Sensia and our Solutions business. Demand is strongly increasing in this segment, as demonstrated by double-digit sequential orders growth and a 1.38 book-to-bill for the segment. Information Solutions & Connected Services grew double digits in both orders and revenue. Q1 sales were particularly strong across the entire Information Solutions portfolio as well as Kalypso's digital consulting services. Industrial cybersecurity demand was strong in the quarter and included a strategic win with one of the world's leading natural gas pipeline companies in North America. We also had a key win with one of the largest Beverage manufacturers in EMEA, demonstrating how our industrial cyber business continues to create new ways for us to win. Our investments in the cloud are also showing very good traction. Another notable win in the quarter was with The Shyft Group, formerly known as Spartan Motors. The Shyft Group is a global leader in the commercial vehicle industry and a big beneficiary of EV and last mile delivery trends. Here, Plex's Smart Manufacturing Platform was chosen to enable best practices across their operations, reduce material costs, automate quality processes, all while supporting high-speed line deployments. At Fiix, we had another great quarter, with their ARR growing over 40% and over 600 new Fiix customers added in just the last 12 months. In the quarter, Rockwell expanded its presence within Lucid Motors, one of the top up-and-coming luxury EV companies in the world. Lucid had already selected Rockwell's FactoryTalk software to manage production and is growing the Fiix subscription base to ensure readiness and facilitate skilled resource effectiveness. This is a great example of the synergies we are already seeing across our cloud and on-prem software portfolios, and the positive contributions they are making to our overall business. I'd also like to highlight the continued traction we see with our PTC partnership. The capabilities and versatility of the combined solution has contributed to our significant software portfolio differentiation and has become a great way to win with customers. In summary, I'm very happy with how these digital offerings are contributing to our recurring revenue base, including contributions from our organically developed software, PTC, and our recent acquisitions. In the quarter, total ARR grew by over 50% and organic ARR grew double digits. Let's now turn to Slide 4 where I'll provide a few highlights of our Q1 end-market performance. Each of our industry segments showed strong, double-digit, year-over-year organic growth. And as we've said, our strong orders are reflective of underlying demand. Advance orders for longer lead time products that are not immediately needed made up about 10% of the total. In our Discrete industry segment, sales grew approximately 20% versus the prior year. Within this industry segment, Automotive sales grew mid-teens, led by a 50% increase in EV capital project activity around the world and strong growth in EV battery, led by our independent cart technology. Semiconductor sales grew over 25% in the quarter, with strong double-digit growth in all regions. Significant greenfield project activity is leading to our strong growth at semiconductor-focused engineering firms and machine builders. eCommerce was our fastest-growing vertical, with sales growing approximately 50% over the prior year. eCommerce orders included a series of multi-million dollar wins to automate new fulfillment centers throughout North America for a well-known eCommerce provider. We believe our strong differentiation in Motion, including advanced material handling technology, and support services are driving market share gains in this fast-growing vertical. Turning now to our Hybrid industry segment. The verticals in this segment also had a terrific quarter. Food and Beverage grew over 20% in Q1, with broad growth across the regions. Once again, SKU expansion, end-of-line automation, and the need for greater manufacturing flexibility are important trends requiring greater levels of automation. We believe the steady pipeline of greenfield and brownfield project opportunities, our deep relationships with machine builders, and our strong technology differentiation are driving record demand in this key vertical. Life Sciences sales grew over 10% in Q1, off of an extremely strong quarter last year and remains one of our fastest-growing verticals in fiscal 2022. We have significantly invested in this area of our business over the last few years and believe we are well-positioned to gain more share through broader and deeper offerings and expertise. Our fastest growing vertical in the Hybrid segment this quarter was Tire, which grew about 35% in the quarter. This is another great vertical that is investing heavily in innovation. Turning to Process, this industry segment grew approximately 15%, led by improving trends in upstream and midstream Oil and Gas. Our Sensia joint venture had strong sales and orders in the quarter, led by strength in process automation and lift control solutions. Sensia's digitalization solutions are well suited to the energy industry's desire to improve productivity and extend the useful life of existing infrastructure, as well as the desire to use modern technology to improve safety and reduce environmental impact. As operating and capital budgets increasingly open up, we believe Sensia is well-positioned for double-digit growth in fiscal 2022. Turning now to Slide 5 and our Q1 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales grew by 16% versus the prior year, with strong double-digit growth across all three industry segments. EMEA sales increased 15%, driven by strength in Food and Beverage and Tire and Metals. Asia-Pacific was our fastest growing region in Q1, growing 25%, with broad-based growth led by Semiconductor and Food and Beverage. In China, we saw double-digit growth driven by strength in Tire, Food and Beverage, Chemical, and Mass Transit. Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review highlights for the full year outlook. We now expect orders for the year to exceed $9 billion, which is above what we expected just a few months ago and really taking our business to a whole new level. We continue to expect total reported sales growth of 17.5%, including 15.5% organic growth versus the prior year. Our projections reflect a detailed review of supply chain constraints by supplier and product line over the course of the year, but as we've said before, these constraints remain very dynamic. We continue to expect double-digit growth in both Core Automation as well as Information Solutions and Connected Services. Acquisitions are off to a good start and expected to contribute two points of profitable top line growth. We are maintaining our margin expectation and adjusted EPS target of $10.80 for the year, which represents about 15% growth at the midpoint of the range compared to the prior year. I should add that we continue to expect another year of double-digit annual recurring revenue growth, including our recent Plex acquisition, which adds approximately $170 million to our ARR totals in fiscal 2022. A more detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 7. I won't go into the details on this slide, but as you can see, there is no change to the outlook for our three industry segments. With that, let me now turn it over to Nick, who will elaborate on our Q1 results and financial outlook for fiscal 2022. Nick? Thanks, Nick. Strong order trends and record backlog underpin a robust top line outlook for fiscal 2022. As we said last quarter, we are making investments in our capacity, technology, and people to support our future growth. We are investing in our operations to expand capacity by $500 million per quarter, while at the same time increasing the resiliency of our supply chains. We made significant progress in the quarter to release FactoryTalk SaaS offerings, including new Plex smart manufacturing platform capabilities, and we've expanded FiiX's applied AI capabilities. We also released the next version of Emulate3D to further our capabilities in creating and operating digital twins of production systems. A significant release of new Logix functionality is scheduled for next quarter. Importantly, last year's accelerated organic investments have allowed us to release new secure remote access functionality and cloud-based data management of automation design information earlier than originally anticipated. In summary, Q1 was a great start to the year. We've been very busy capitalizing on the opportunities we see today, while at the same time building for the future. I want to take a moment to recognize the people in our organization and the tremendous work that went into these results during especially challenging times. We are making significant investments in existing and new talent and are empowering them with the technologies and resources to be successful. We continue to encourage fresh ideas from across the organization and look at ways to increase our value through the customer's eyes. I feel confident that investments in automation and digital transformation have never been more top of mind than they are today. As a pure-play leader devoted exclusively to these areas, we think our agility, our differentiated portfolio of products and services, our significant domain expertise, and our ecosystem of best-in-class partners, make us the best positioned company to benefit from what should be a significant, multi-year growth cycle. Let me now pass the baton back to Jessica to begin the Q&A session. Hey, Scott. I think \u2013 Scott, I think we're still climbing the adoption curve there. But everybody is aware of the promise of being able to simulate production systems before actually starting to run material through the line. And this is one of those areas that I think the pandemic accelerated, because you couldn't get everybody that you traditionally would have wanted to be on-site, shoulder to shoulder on a line commissioning a new line. And so the ability to go and to digitize your system to be able to tune it, to be able to get a good picture of what should happen takes you much further down the path without actually having to have people together and running product through a line in the traditional way. So we see the most advanced companies well into proofs of concept. We're heavily involved with them on that. And I should add, this is an area that the Kalypso acquisition and then followed by the more recent AVATA acquisition has really helped to complement the technology that we have with Emulate3D and some of the new Logix capabilities to have the people who can describe that holistically at the higher levels of the organization that are required to sign off on that sort of initiative has really been helpful for us. No. I think a couple of things. First of all, I do think that this cycle is going to be a little bit unusual. Now there's always some differences from one cycle to the next. But I think this one maybe a little bit elongated, because with the amount of longer-term capital investment in verticals wide semiconductor, where that new capacity is not going to come on for a while, where they still have to build an ecosystem of local partners around these big fabs. I think we could see a cycle that actually lasts a little bit longer than maybe that mean in the past. In terms of demand and being able to supply into this, right now, the bottleneck is the chips. We're working through that, but I still think that the material is getting out there and we are going to see the completion of these projects. I can't \u2013 I haven't seen any evidence that people are not moving forward with their expansion plans because of supply chain constraints. They're slowing them down, but everybody is trying to come out of the pandemic better positioned than their competitors in terms of capacity and new offerings, and I don't see that changing. Hey, Andrew. So Andrew, we have a broad base of suppliers. Obviously, it goes well beyond just the semiconductor suppliers. But even within that category, we're managing a broad base of suppliers because virtually all of our Intelligent Devices are intelligent. They have semiconductor based technology. We are in daily contact with our key suppliers through our supply chain organization and conversations that include me and my senior team. And basically, we were able to get a few more chips in the first quarter than we had originally forecast, but we're expecting the second quarter to be a little bit lighter. It's a dynamic situation, but the fundamental, I guess, framework you should think about is that with the enormous backlog that we have the new incoming orders are coming in on top of that. So the demand is not the constraint, and we don't expect it to be for quite some time to come. Nick, anything to add to that? Yes. Andrew, just specifically in terms of the things within Software & Control, as we've talked about, cloud-native software development in multiple products within the FactoryTalk Hub that we explored a little bit during Investor Day. There's also new visualization tools, hardware and software that are under development and then new hardware functionality around the Logix control system. We're going to have major new product releases in all three of those areas in the next 12 months. Yes. Thank you. The PTC relationship is going well. Hey, Jeff. Yes. Jeff, the other main component, I'd say, of the equation is the very large entering backlog that we have there. So these orders \u2013 continued orders growth comes on top of historic levels of backlog. And even the longer lead time orders, and I'll describe that a little bit, those will likely shift or a large part of that will shift in the fiscal year. So when we say longer lead time, that doesn't necessarily mean it's pushed down beyond the end of fiscal 2022. To be sure, we're going to have very large backlog in any scenario at the end of fiscal 2022 setting up for fiscal 2023. But let me give an example of what those advanced orders would be. So you think of an OEM that has big backlog in their own shop of machines to be built, and they would typically buy, let's say, three months of components from Rockwell, controllers and drives and servo amplifiers and so on. Because of the longer lead times, they may extend that out to six months' worth of component orders that they're placing on us. So that's the example where they have the demand. It's not speculative they just increased their advanced orders in that respect. And we look carefully at both that customer demand as well as distributor order patterns. We're working closely with them, and that gives us the confidence to say that this is representative of underlying demand that goes right to the end user. Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Hey, Josh. Yes. It's in line with the idea that we've talked about of accelerating profitable growth, and we remain committed to the IDN or seeing this play out that nothing expands margins like top line growth. And so we think that we're striking a good balance between the near-term profitability and the investment to create an even brighter future. Josh, it's supply chain constraints. We've got this enormous demand that's a result, I think, of three basic things. First of all, it's the secular trends that you're seeing play out across industries and geography, placing a higher degree of importance on automation and digital transformation than ever before. So it's secular. It's also cyclical. We are still early in what we believe is going to be a multi-year period of economic expansion. And then finally, it's our position in this market. And I think all three of those things are driving the demand. Yes. And just a final point just to summarize, fiscal 2022 sales would be higher were it not for the supply chain constraints. So we're managing, as Nick said, our capacity, our labor based on very dynamic practices hand to hand around the world, making sure that we're acquiring talent, keeping talent, paying competitive wages, all those things, we're keeping ahead of it. Yes. Thanks, Josh. Yes. The other point I would just add is we've continued to see this order momentum for multiple quarters now. And the trends are extending into January. So we see it, again, as reflective of underlying demand in multiple industries, and we can point to the specific investments based on the large greenfields that have been announced as well as on the ground individual salespeople from distributors, from our own people who are directly involved in these projects. So we feel very good about the overall demand. Thanks, Julian. Hey Brendan. I think its new investment. I would not look at it as shifting manufacturing, although I think manufacturing in North America is probably a larger percentage of a company's global investment than it has been traditionally. So I don't see people closing plants in Asia, for instance, and bringing them back as the majority of what's driving the demand. But I do see, as people are planning new capacity, whether it's brownfields or greenfields or upgrades adding digitization solutions to existing capacity. I see North America, and that obviously is our strongest market, as being an outsized beneficiary. So automation, in general, as I said before, from a secular standpoint is increasing. Then in the cycle, it's still early. And our position in high growth, high investment areas of both geography and technology are positive in what are driving a lot of this outlook. Thanks, Brendan. Hey, Steve. No. There is no \u2013 Yes. And I would just say continued very strong backlog. So just a simple math of what we shipped and what we booked indicates the backlog remains and even grows. So that remains healthy. Yes. Thank you. Hey, Andy. Sure. Just specifically on China, if we look at the verticals that contributed to that strong double-digit growth, there was a Tire, which, in general, of course, continues to be a great vertical, and there's a lot of tire activity complementing the EV activity going on in China, and we're a beneficiary of that. Food and Beverage is an area where that worldwide is our single biggest vertical. And we've had some great recent traction within China in Food and Beverage, Chemical and then Mass Transit. So these are industries that have generally been pretty good for us in China. And when I talk about new ways to get to market, it's really complementing our traditional distribution. But we've also given our local leadership more empowerment to make investments that they say are appropriate with our relatively lower share in China. We think by doing basic things correctly, there's lots of room to run. And it's a combination of our core products as well as the new ways to win, Information Solutions & Connected Services. And those are really seen as a calling card getting into customers even when their installed base might be with competitive product, it's a way for engaging high level decision makers as we bring that new value to them. And those companies across Food and Beverage and Life Sciences and EV, they're all intensely interested in climbing the productivity curve fast. And so that's where we see particular endorsement of our software, which is a strong contributor in China as well as new disruptive technology like independent card, which we continue to win some very large orders in China based on independent card, particularly in EV and battery assembly. Thanks, Andy."

I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. Later on the call, we will open up the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations and Market Strategy. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead.\nAijana Zellner: Thank you, Abby. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2023 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our Web site. Both the press release and charts include and our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our Web site for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our Web site at the conclusion of today's call. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. So with that, I'll hand it over to Blake.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our fourth quarter results on Slide 3. We delivered strong double digit growth this quarter, with both sales and adjusted earnings growing by over 20% year-over-year. Our solid execution and improving supply chain helped us exceed our Q4 expectations, resulting in double digit sales growth across all regions and business segments.  With lead times significantly improving across our product lines, we were able to deliver products to customers faster than expected this quarter, contributing to over $2.5 billion in total sales. This record shipment reflects Rockwell's continued capacity investments, and demonstrates our organization's ability to scale for sustained growth.  Total sales were up 20.5% versus prior year. Organic sales grew almost 18% year-over-year. Currency translation and acquisitions each contributed about a 1.5 of growth in the quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the split of our sales by business segment, region and industry was largely driven by the composition of our backlog.  In our intelligent devices business segment, organic sales increased 18% versus prior year with strong growth across all regions. Within this segment, Independent Cart Technology had another strong quarter, finishing this fiscal year with over 50% growth in sales. This offering continues to be an integral part of our advanced material handling and production logistics offering.  We are excited about our latest addition to this differentiated portfolio with our acquisition of Clearpath Robotics, and I will cover some strategic highlights of this deal later on the call. Software and control organic sales grew 23% year-over-year.  We continue to innovate in both the software and hardware portions of our architecture, with significant new offerings such as high availability, process IO, FactoryTalk optics, and FactoryTalk data mosaics. We are pleased with how our organic and inorganic investments in this business are delivering new customer value and continued share gains.  Lifecycle Services organic sales were up over 10% year-over-year. Book to bill in this segment was 0.97 and above the historical average for Q4. Within this segment, our Sensia joint venture had a strong finish to the year with over 50% year-over-year order growth in the quarter. This growth was driven by strategic wins in process automation and artificial lift control systems, positioning this business for continued double digit growth and improved profitability in fiscal year '24.  Information Solutions and Connected Services sales grew 10% versus prior year. One of the largest Information Solutions wins ever was with Prometeon Tyre, a global leader in tyre manufacturing headquartered in Italy. This customer was already using our cloud native Plex quality management system, and has recently selected our on-prem MES software to digitize the manufacturing processes at a number of their global sites. This win not only demonstrates the standalone differentiation of our modular offerings, but also highlights the value from the integration of our entire portfolio, making it easier for customers to standardize their global operations.  Within Connected Services, we continue to grow our cybersecurity practice with Q4 sales growing 30% year-over-year. Our industrial cybersecurity software and expertise along with differentiated partnerships on the IT security front are helping us grow our cybersecurity services into a business of well over $100 million this fiscal year, with a significant portion of this being recurring revenue. Total annual recurring revenue grew 16% year-over-year. That's a good number, and ARR is a meaningful contributor to our future growth framework.  Segment margin of 22.3% was in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $3.64, which is a company record for quarterly earnings, grew almost 20% year-over-year. Significantly improving lead times in our Q4 shipment over performance contributed to rapid backlog production in the quarter. We are ending the year with over $4.1 billion in backlog, over 40% coverage of annual sales, which is still well above pre-pandemic levels. A return to superior customer service remains our highest priority.  Let's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q4 end market performance. Our discrete sales grew over 15% versus prior year. Within discrete, automotive sales were up 30% year-over-year, reflecting continued strength of our offerings in both electric vehicle and battery. Our EV business was close to 40% of our total automotive revenue in the quarter, growing double digits both year-over-year and sequentially.  One of our strategic battery wins was with Nanotech Energy, a startup with new and innovative energy storage technologies. Nanotech has chosen Rockwell as their exclusive automation partner to build new battery Gigafactories. Semiconductor sales grew high single digits. We continue to take share in facilities management control system applications and major semiconductor companies across the globe.  In addition to our existing portfolio, we continue to win and build down a strong funnel of advanced wafer transport solutions, leveraging our Independent Cart Technology across customers' greenfield and brownfield projects. We're also participating in the rapid build down of data centers to support cloud computing and artificial intelligence.  Our control systems are used to control and optimize the environment and safety systems in these facilities. And our recent CUBIC acquisition extends our reach into the power distribution portion of data centers. We've seeing some strategic wins in Asia and in the U.S. in the quarter with more to come.  In our e-commerce and warehouse automation vertical, sales declined mid-single digits versus prior year. After several quarters of customer delays and cancellations in the e-commerce portion of this vertical, we're starting to see new investments, especially in North America, positioning us for low single digit year-over-year growth in fiscal year '24.  Turning to our hybrid industries, strong sales in this segment were paced by good growth in food and beverage, our largest customer vertical. Food and beverage sales grew low double digits versus prior year. In addition to continued cybersecurity and infrastructure modernization wins in this vertical, we had several wins in Q4 incorporating generative AI functionality, where our digital services business is helping our CPG customers use real-time AI assistance as they develop new products, formulations and recipes.  Life Sciences sales grew mid single digits in the quarter. This vertical is a great example of how we are delivering expanded customer value through a combination of software, hardware and digital services capabilities. This quarter, our PlantPAx system was selected by [indiscernible], a global biotechnology company developing innovative and affordable cancer medicines for their process control and environmental monitoring solutions at a greenfield site in New Jersey. Tire was up high teens in the quarter with multiple wins across the globe, including the large software deal at Prometeon Tyre I mentioned earlier on the call. Moving to process. Sales in this industry segment grew over 25% year-over-year, led by strong growth in oil and gas, mining and metals. Oil and gas sales were up over 30% in the quarter. This growth was driven by a combination of digital oilfield solutions, including process safety and lift control in EMEA and Asia, as well as several new carbon capture wins in North America. We continue to grow our process industry footprint with the combination of Sensia and Rockwell oil and gas capabilities.  We had a notable win this quarter at Multitex Filtration Engineers, an India headquartered global EPC company working on onshore and offshore projects. This was a competitive DCS win for Rockwell, with one of the largest government-owned oil and gas explorer and producers in India. And we are excited to partner with Multitex as they increase their footprint in the U.S. and Middle East. Turning now to Slide 5 and our Q4 organic regional sales. Once again our sales by region in Q4 and for the full year fiscal year '23 reflect the composition of our backlog rather than the underlying customer demand. Our full year orders in the Americas outperformed the rest of the world. North America organic sales were up over 12% year-over-year, but Latin America and EMEA sales grew over 20% in the quarter and Asia Pacific was up over 31%. While we saw strong sales growth in China in fiscal year '23, we continue to see high order deferrals and cancellations in China. Let's move to Slide 6, key highlights of fiscal year 2023. We had a record year of sales and earnings with our total sales exceeding $9 billion. We achieved this milestone ahead of the timeframe we anticipated when we introduced our framework for accelerated profitable growth at Investor Day in 2019. Both reported and organic sales grew 17% this year, well above our original expectations.  Information Solutions and Connected Services were up 9% year-over-year, reaching over $870 million, demonstrating our customers' accelerated adoption of new digital offerings. This is almost 3x what this figure was in 2018. Total ARR grew 16% with strong growth in both our software-as-a-service and recurring services offerings. Our strong operating performance resulted in 140 basis points of segment margin expansion versus prior year. Adjusted EPS of $12.12 was up 28%. We generated a record $1.2 billion of free cash flow this year. The much better free cash flow conversion in the quarter was primarily driven by improved working capital. This represents 86% free cash flow conversion for the year, and Nick will provide more detail in his remarks. And last but not least, we continue to invest in key areas of growth. In the last few months, we made two acquisitions, Clearpath and Verve, to further expand our value and accelerate top line growth.  While we'll talk more about those investments at our upcoming Investor Day, let's turn to Slide 7 and take a few minutes to share why we are excited about the impact Clearpath will have on both our near and longer term growth. As we've shared with you earlier in the quarter, Clearpath is a leader in autonomous mobile robots, or AMRs, serving customers across many industry segments.  Their differentiated portfolio of auto brand AMRs is focused on the production logistics space, where customers traditionally have relied on manual labor to move raw materials and subassemblies to the right place on production lines, and also to move finished goods to shipping docks and warehouses. These workflows have been identified by many automotive companies, semiconductor fabs, and consumer packaged goods suppliers as their top opportunity for efficiency and increased safety.  Given the workforce shortage and skills gap, along with the overall move to more autonomous operations, the market for industrial mobile robots in factory floor applications is expected to grow over 30% for the next five years, and we believe no one is better positioned to capitalize on this growth than Rockwell and Clearpath. Together, we are the only end-to-end provider of autonomous operations in this space.  We'll bring together our FactoryTalk design capabilities to configure and simulate the production environment, including these AMRs, integrate with our cloud native operations management software, like Plex and Fiix, and optimize the production process with our logics and embedded AI capabilities, all with one technology platform.  This is an important milestone for Rockwell, and you will see more of what this can do for industrial operations at Automation Fair and Investor Day next week. We closed this acquisition in early October and expect it to contribute about a point of growth to our top line performance in fiscal year '24.  As we move to Slide 8, let's review our fiscal 2024 outlook. Consistent with what we shared with you on our last earnings call, our orders continued to decrease in fiscal 2023 reaching what we believe to be a trough in our fourth quarter. Orders for the full year were $8.2 billion. We expect fiscal year '24 orders to increase low single digits year-over-year. Order growth is expected to be highest in the Americas. Asia orders are expected to be down year-over-year due to China. However, a relatively low exposure to China helps to reduce the impact on our global results.  The lead times on our products have largely returned to pre-pandemic levels, with the remainder of our SKUs getting back to normal lead times around the end of our fiscal Q1. This addresses the final golden screw constraints to shipping past due backlog and clearing committed inventory at our distributors. Based on our analysis of lead time reduction by product line, distributor inventory and underlying demand at our largest machine builders and end users, we expect orders to begin to recover in Q1 and build in Q2.  Customers continue to move forward with plans for both greenfield and brownfield capacity investments and also with resilience projects requiring increased cybersecurity and digitization. In the U.S., we've been adding commercial resources specifically focused on projects that are incented by recent stimulus authorized by legislation, including infrastructure, IRA and the CHIPS and Science Act. This team won new business during the second half of fiscal year '23 with the strong funnel of additional projects expected to close in fiscal year '24.  Our fiscal '24 guidance assumes total reported sales of about $9.4 billion at the midpoint. Organic sales are projected to grow 1% at the midpoint. Currency is expected to increase sales by 1.5% and acquisitions are slated to contribute about a point of growth. We are projecting ARR to have another year of double digit growth. Segment margin is expected to increase slightly versus prior year. Nick will cover this in more detail later.  Adjusted EPS is slated to grow 5% year-over-year at the midpoint. At a high level, we expect strong conversion on slightly higher year-over-year organic sales. Good performance in reducing backlog during Q4 of fiscal '23 put forward about $100 million of revenue and $0.25 of earnings. Clearpath is expected to reduce fiscal year '24 adjusted earnings by a similar amount.  Let me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q4 performance and financial outlook for fiscal '24. Nick?\nNick Gangestad: Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 9, fourth quarter key financial information. Fourth quarter reported sales were up 20.5% over last year. Q4 organic sales were up 17.7% and acquisitions contributed 140 basis points to growth. Currency translation increased sales by 140 basis points. About 6 points of our organic growth came from price.  Segment operating margin was 22.3% compared to 23.3% a year ago. The year-over-year decrease reflects the impact of higher sales volume and higher price being more than offset by higher incentive compensation, investment spend and restructuring actions.  Adjusted EPS of $3.64 was above our expectations, primarily due to higher organic sales, partially offset by higher investment spend and incentive compensation. We also took a restructuring charge in the quarter of just over $20 million, which is expected to yield more than $40 million of benefits on an annualized basis. All-in, adjusted EPS grew 20% versus prior year. I'll cover our year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide.  The adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 17%, slightly below the prior year rate. Free cash flow of $776 million was $417 million higher than prior year. Our strong free cash flow generation in the quarter was driven by higher income and reductions in working capital. As you know, due to supply chain volatility, we have seen working capital balances grow over the last couple of years. And we are pleased to see our action starting to bring working capital down.  One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased approximately 200,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $55 million. On September 30, $900 million remained available under our repurchase authorization.  Slide 10 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Blake discussed our top line performance in the quarter, so I'll focus on our margin performance. Given our pay-for-performance culture and strong results, all of our business segments saw higher bonus expense this year. In Q4, this represented between 200 and 300 basis points of year-over-year margin headwinds for each of the segments.  Intelligent devices margin decreased by 100 basis points year-over-year, and was up 450 basis points sequentially, because of higher volume. Within intelligent devices, we are investing in our next generation portfolio of drives in IO. Software and control margin of 33.5% decreased 100 basis points year-over-year.  Our strong Q4 margin was driven by 25% year-over-year top line growth. This is the segment with the highest share of incremental investment as we continue to invest in next generation logics performance and our cloud native software portfolio.  Lifecycle Services margin was 8.4% and was under the 10% exit rate we anticipated. In addition to a higher bonus, this segment was the most impacted by the restructuring charges taken in the quarter. Absent those two items, the margin for this segment came in as we planned.  Before moving to the adjusted EPS walk, I'd like to talk about our Sensia joint venture. Challenged by the pandemic and global supply chain constraints, this joint venture underperformed our initial expectations for 2020 through 2023. Our updated outlook, which includes this lower base, resulted in a partial goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter.  Sensia's one-time items and supply chain-related inefficiencies in recent quarters are largely behind us. Sensia delivered double digit top line growth in fiscal '23 and has strong orders growth, as Blake mentioned. Going forward, we expect profitable double digit growth from Sensia.  The next slide, 11, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q4 fiscal '22 to Q4 fiscal '23. Core performance was up $1.05 on a 17.7% organic sales increase. Incentive compensation was a $0.45 headwind. This year-over-year increase reflects the higher bonus payout this year versus a below target payout last year.  The year-over-year impact from currency was a $0.05 headwind offset by a $0.10 tailwind from interest expense. Share count and tax rate were each immaterial to the year-over-year change in EPS this quarter.  Slide 12 provides key financial information for the full fiscal year 2023. Reported sales grew 17% to $9.1 billion, including over one point coming from acquisitions. Currency negatively impacted sales by approximately $100 million or 1.4 points. Organic sales were up 17%.  Full year segment margin of 21.3% increased 140 basis points over last year. The increase was due to higher sales, partially offset by higher investment spend and higher incentive compensation. We accelerated growth investments for fiscal '23 above our original expectations as our revenue outperformed. Adjusted EPS was up 28%. A detailed year-over-year adjusted EPS walk can be found in the appendix for your reference.  As discussed earlier, free cash flow conversion was ahead of our expectations with free cash flow conversion of 86% in fiscal '23. Free cash flow increased $532 million since fiscal '22. The increase in free cash flow was driven by higher pre-tax income. Working Capital peaked in Q3 at 24% of sales and came down to 20% in Q4.  Return on invested capital was 20.9% for fiscal '23 and 570 basis points better than the prior year, primarily driven by higher net income. For the year, we deployed about $850 million of capital towards dividends and share repurchases and made inorganic investments of $170 million. We also paid down debt by about $870 million. Our capital structure and liquidity remains strong. This strength is what allowed us to fund our acquisitions in the first quarter of fiscal year '24 without any new long-term debt.  Before we turn to our fiscal '24 guidance, we want to update you on Q4 orders and our current thinking as we look forward. In Q4, orders decreased quicker than we expected as machine builders and distributors continued to work through inventory in response to our rapidly improving lead times. As Blake said, we believe Q4 was the trough and orders in October support that view. We expect fiscal year '24 orders to grow low single digits with an order profile similar to what we discussed in Q3. Let's now move on to the next slide, 13, guidance for fiscal '24. In fiscal year '24, we are focusing on growing earnings, even in a year of low top line growth. At the same time, we'll continue to invest in our own resilience, in our most important innovation projects to extend our differentiation and in customer-facing resources to capitalize on continuing strong secular demand for automation.  We expect our reported sales growth to range from 0.5% to 6.5%. We expect organic sales growth in the range of negative 2% to positive 4%. We expect acquisitions to add 100 basis points to growth, in addition to a full year currency tailwind of 150 basis points. From a segment perspective, given our exceptionally strong backlog execution in software and control that resulted in 25% top line growth in fiscal year '23, we expect this segment to see the lowest growth in fiscal year '24. We expect positive organic sales growth in both our Intelligent Devices and Lifecycle Services segments.  We expect price will be a positive contributor to growth for the year. Segment margin will be around 21.5%, up slightly from fiscal year '23. This includes a 60 basis point headwind coming from the acquisitions of Clearpath and Verve. Verve's impact to adjusted EPS is relatively flat in fiscal year '24.  Clearpath will reduce earnings per share in fiscal year '24 by $0.25 on an unlevered basis. This impact reflects continued R&D and commercialization investments as well as integration expenses. We expect the Clearpath acquisition to become accretive to earnings in fiscal year '26. We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. Our adjusted EPS guidance range is $12.00 to $13.50.  We expect full year fiscal '24 free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. This reflects our expectation that inventory days on hand will drop to 125 days by the end of fiscal year '24 compared to approximately 140 days of inventory we had at the end of fiscal year '23. Our outlook for cash tax payments is higher due to a tax payment for realized capital gains on the sale of our stake in PTC and higher tax payments required under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We expect free cash flow conversion in the first half to be well below 100%, mostly tied to the timing of our incentive compensation payout and income tax payments.  From a calendarization perspective, we expect year-over-year organic sales to grow in the low single digits in Q1, followed by sequential growth in sales volume as we progress through the year. As a result of our strong Q4 backlog performance, volumes will be down from Q4 to Q1. Given this dynamic, Q1 is projected to be our lowest margin quarter with sequential improvement throughout the year.  For the full year, let's turn to Slide 14 for our adjusted EPS walk. Our core is expected to have a modest positive impact on earnings of about $0.05 from fiscal year '23 to fiscal year '24. Structural productivity from our Q4 actions is expected to increase earnings by $0.25, while increased growth investments will reduce earnings by $0.55.  Incentive compensation for fiscal year '23 was above target due to strong performance. So this represents a tailwind of $0.85 for fiscal '24. Acquisitions will be dilutive by $0.25. Our 150 basis points of sales growth from currency will add $0.25, and the net of interest tax and shares will contribute about $0.05.  A few additional comments on fiscal '24 guidance. Corporate and other expense is expected to be around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal '24 is expected to be about $115 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.3 million shares. We expect to deploy between $300 million and $500 million to share repurchases during the year.  With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Nick. As I reflect on 2023, it's clear our continued investments in talent and technology are paying off. I'm proud of how our tight knit organization has navigated through a dynamic environment and helped us deliver a record year of sales and earnings exceeding expectations. Looking at the year ahead of us, we are aware of the macroeconomic backdrop and the geopolitical situation that continues to change every day. You heard us talk today about focusing and optimizing our workforce productivity so that we can continue investing in key areas of growth.  Our customers rely on our continued innovation and differentiation to provide energy and critical infrastructure security across the globe to help bring new life saving drugs to market and to use leading technology to augment and enable their workforce.  We look forward to seeing a lot of you at our Investor Day in Boston next week, where we will be sharing our long-term business strategy and some of the most exciting developments across our key markets and applications.  Aijana will now begin the Q&A session.\nAijana Zellner: We would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow up. Abby, let's take our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open.\nScott Davis: Hi. Good morning, guys, and Aijana.\nBlake Moret: Good morning, Scott.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Davis: A lot here, and I'm glad you're doing the Investor Day, because I think there's a lot to dig in here. But until we get there, can you give us a little bit more color on the China comments just around delays and cancellations? It's not a shock, given what we're reading, but maybe a little bit more granularity on what you're seeing there?\nBlake Moret: Sure. So just for context, China's about 6% of our worldwide sales, so big manufacturing economy but relatively low exposure for Rockwell there. And we saw very strong sales in China for the year. But in China, the orders were lower. And that is the source of the cancellations that we did see. While our worldwide cancellations are roughly in line with what we've been seeing, China is the highest component of that. And I would say it's broad based. It's not one particular industry. We still see wins and investments in areas like EV, but the distributors that most of our products go to market through in China still have relatively high inventories and they're working that off.\nScott Davis: Okay, that's helpful. And you mentioned that the goodwill impairment on Sensia, but it looks like the next few years, the outlook there is pretty darn good. How do you kind of pair that up? And I would imagine you don't take it too lightly when you take a goodwill impairment. So I'll just stop there.\nBlake Moret: Sure, Scott. So we launched the entity with at the time Schlumberger a few months before the pandemic, so that was in 2019. And the lower base that resulted from COVID shutdowns and the subsequent supply chain shortages along with a refinement of some of the original mix assumptions caused us to take the impairment. We've changed out the management team at Sensia. And we've seen the last couple of quarters of encouraging improvement. We have great orders, good backlog, and improving profitability. And so we expect over the next few years that Sensia will actually be quite a large contributor to the improved profitability in Lifecycle Services.\nScott Davis: Yes, I would assume that too. Okay, I'll pass it on. Thank you. I appreciate it. Good luck. I'll see you next week.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Your line is open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone.\nBlake Moret: Hi, Andy.\nNick Gangestad: Hi, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Blake, just focusing on your guidance of low single digit order growth in FY '24 on your confidence of a trough in orders in Q4 '23, could you give us more color in terms of what gives you that confidence? You mentioned orders in October are supporting your view. Maybe you could elaborate on what you're seeing. And then obviously, there have been many conversations regarding mega projects and where we are in that cycle. Do you see your orders being more lumpy centered around mega projects in FY '24 and what are the verticals that they're most likely to come from?\nBlake Moret: Sure. Thanks, Andy. So first of all, in terms of the orders development, we saw orders ramp up throughout Q4. And then we saw October orders up sequentially from that, and supportive of our view that Q4 was the trough. We expect orders to continue recovering throughout Q1 and building in Q2. So that's the view in terms of the orders development. And that's based on what we're seeing what I just described, as well as direct discussions with our end users and machine builders that have the largest contribution to our business. So we went and did a detailed analysis of their CapEx expectations, their OpEx expectations, what projects that we have the opportunities with. And that coupled with our own personal views and with our distributor feedback are all supportive of this shape of the order recovery curve. In terms of the mega projects, I don't know that that's going to contribute so much to the lumpiness. I think it's going to be a positive, additional amount of business that builds throughout fiscal year '24 and beyond. The majority of the projects that we're tracking, and we're tracking literally hundreds of projects that are incented by some of the recent stimulus, the majority of those projects have not made a decision or have not released the automation equipment. So when you look at those projects, certain equipment, which would probably include switchgear, things like that, would be led earlier in the project cycle with automation to follow after that. So we think that we're still in the early innings with respect to those mega projects. And our tracking processes and our early wins are very encouraging.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Very helpful, Blake. And Nick maybe just going over your margin expectation a little more for the segments in '24. You already answered Scott's question on Sensia. But what's your confidence level that we do you see a step up in '24 in Lifecycle Services? And then particularly in Intelligent Devices, obviously, that segment has had let's call it some perturbation, some supply chain, do you see more normal environment and improvements in '24 in that segment?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. In terms of expectations by segment for fiscal year '24, we do expect that Lifecycle Services will be the most significant year-on-year margin expander. And to answer your question, we are highly competent in that based on the actions that we have taken in '23 and based on the outlook we have for that business in '24. On the opposite side, software and control, we saw outstanding growth in fiscal year '23, as we had strong execution on our backlog. And we expect that business to be the one with the lowest organic growth and then that will translate into lower year-on-year margin in our software and control business, primarily driven by that lower growth. And it happens to also be the segment where we're putting the majority of our incremental investments. From an Intelligent Devices perspective, that's one where we expect the margins year-on-year to be flat to up slightly. And that is with the impact of Clearpath in there. Clearpath is for this segment alone about 100 basis point headwind. And that will be impacting throughout the year. But we'll definitely be seeing that impact in Q1 in Intelligent Devices. And the actions that we've been doing in Intelligent Devices around our productivity and our investments in products, that's what's leading us to expect margins to be flat to up slightly.\nAndy Kaplowitz: I appreciate the color, guys.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Andy.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, all.\nBlake Moret: Hi, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Good morning. I just want to come back to kind of orders and backlog. I'm just kind of confused by the comment that orders ramped during Q4, right? The ending backlog is 4.1 billion. You were guiding 4.5 billion to 5 billion. I know you pulled forward 100 million in sales, right? But maybe just bridge us on what happened other than that sales pull forward. How much of it was cancellations versus just kind of regular way order normalization, if there's a way to do that?\nBlake Moret: Sure. Let me make a couple of comments, Jeff. And then Nick may have some to add as well. So we saw orders increasing. If you look at beginning of the quarter of Q4 to the end, we saw orders exit at a higher rate than at the beginning of Q4, and then with a good uptick from that sequentially in October. So that was the ramp we were talking about, and why we believe that Q4 was the trough for orders.\nNick Gangestad: Yes. And, Jeff, just to go a little deeper in that, what we're seeing -- one of the dynamics we're seeing in Q4 and we expect to continue through Q1 as well is our channel partners, our distributors working to right size their inventory as we are seeing -- as they are seeing good reductions in our lead times. They're doing the right actions of bringing their inventory levels down. And that's resulting in lower orders being placed on us. And we expect that to continue through Q1. And we think Q2, as we -- and as we discuss with all of our distributors, Q2 is where that will start to change where the inventory levels at our distributors will be reaching the normal level that they expect. So partly I say that just to say, we don't really see this level of orders we're seeing now as normalized. We're seeing them the correct reaction to the actions they're taking to bring their inventory levels down.\nBlake Moret: And if I can add to that. So our distributors are seeing a higher level of incoming orders than they in turn are placing on us due to their high inventory levels. So we have, as you would imagine, very good visibility into our distributors' incoming orders from their customers, from their end users and the machine builders. And that order activity is higher than what they're in turn placing on us. So that gives us additional confidence that orders will ramp up as their inventory situation comes down.\nJeff Sprague: And then maybe just on the guide. If I heard right, I think you said you're expecting positive organic growth in Q1. Obviously, you have a negative in your guide range. I would have thought if that negative were to happen, it would actually happen in Q1 with this order normalization. So maybe just kind of talk about your thought process of what gets you to the negative organic growth for the year versus being positive in Q1?\nBlake Moret: Sure. So at the negative end, you would see a slower reduction of inventories at our distributors and a deterioration in the macro. At the upper end of the range, you would see distributors stabilizing their inventory at higher levels than they did before. So getting back to that equilibrium and placing orders that are more reflective of the underlying demand from users and integrators and machine builders. And you would also see at the high end some of the impact from the big projects being spurred by stimulus, specifically in the U.S. I should add as well that on the high end if we talk about total sales, some of the performance in terms of new acquisitions I think there's some opportunity there as well.\nNick Gangestad: And, Jeff, to follow up on the one question about why Q1, why we think that will be low single digit growth? Yes. If we were only looking at the orders, your question would -- that would make sense why not negative. However, we also continue to have a 4.1 billion backlog that we're entering the year with. And so what we're seeing in our Q1 revenue is a combination of continued sales of some of that backlog coupled with the lower orders we're expecting in Q1.\nBlake Moret: Yes. And if I could just add one additional piece. We do expect shipments to ramp sequentially in terms of volume through the year. You get into a little bit of the math of comparables based on having such strong shipments at the tail end of the year that enters into the math of the year-over-year growth as well.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thank you for the color.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAndrew Obin: Yes. Good morning.\nBlake Moret: Good morning.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Maybe just to unpack this minus 2% growth rate limit further, historically, there's been a strong connection between CapEx and your sort of view of the growth rate. I'm sure you'll tell us a lot more about it at the Analyst Day in your new framework. I fully appreciate it. But what kind of macro do we need to see for minus 2% to manifest itself? Does this imply push outs of EV batteries? Could you just describe the macro environment behind the minus 2% [indiscernible] forecast? Thank you.\nBlake Moret: Yes. I think that would contemplate push outs that turn into cancellations quite frankly, whereas if a project is pushed by a couple of months, it's not going to have a big impact in the year. But if some of those projects or a larger amount of those projects rolled over into deferrals or cancellations, if people said [indiscernible] just kidding about EV, we don't need to build out the semiconductor industry process, which is 35% of our business, if people aren't looking to increase energy, both hydrocarbon and renewable energy forms in the U.S. If we saw a significant reduction of those projects, I think that would contribute to that minus -- that downside part of the range.\nAndrew Obin: Got you. And just to follow up, ARR of 16%, which is pretty decent for an industrial software company, nice exit rate. So what kind of software growth is embedded? What kind of ARR assumptions are in your '24 forecast? Thank you.\nBlake Moret: Yes, we're looking at 15% ARR. And we're very proud of that ARR number, because it's broad based. It's not just the newer acquisitions like Plex and Fiix, but it's our traditional offerings as well, some of the on-prem software. And as we go through the year, based on overall Rockwell, we do expect ARR to increase to above 9% of our total sales in the year. It's a combination, both of the software as well as the high value recurring services. We made some organizational changes to supercharge that area. And that along with some of the new developments and offerings that we have, make us very optimistic about the contribution that ARR is going to have to our overall growth. And obviously, we like the resiliency that it gives our results by not starting each year at zero with respect to software sales.\nAndrew Obin: Thanks so much.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks very much. Maybe I just wanted to follow up first off on Nick your comments on the first quarter. So is the right assumption sort of low single digit organic growth in Q1, as you said? And then margins for the year are guided flattish for the total company. Are we assuming kind of Q1 is similar to that year-on-year just given the acquisition headwinds and so forth? So you have sort of sales up and little bit margins flat and then earnings up a little bit year-on-year then.\nNick Gangestad: Julian, thanks for asking that question. Q1 organic growth year-on-year we think will be low single digits. On the margin question, Q1 of last year, we had a margin of 20%. We expect that to be lower year-on-year in fiscal year '24. And there's three things that are going to be mainly contributing to it being lower. One is our Clearpath acquisition and the impact that will have. The second is mix that we see a less favorable mix in the first quarter of the products that we will be selling. And we think we'll be having lower utilization in our factories as we're adjusting our production to these lower orders. And we think those three things in combination are going to be resulting in lower margin year-on-year.\nJulian Mitchell: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then I just wanted to come back to the revenue outlook. So one question maybe, we look at North America. I think the guide implies maybe sales are up mid single digits there or something this year. And in '23, North America was the lowest growth region globally. And so we're sort of seven years on from U.S.-China tariffs, two years on from the IIJA. Is it just the pace of these onshore and stimulus projects is so much slower than perhaps people often hope or assume? And just wanted to check that for the year, are you assuming -- it looks like the book to bill will be about 0.9x. Is that correct and what's embedded in the orders and sales color? Thank you.\nBlake Moret: Let me start with the Americas discussion and then Nick can follow up with a little bit on the book to bill. So the Americas actually outpaced the rest of the world with respect to orders. And we expect that to continue in fiscal year '24. We've talked about for a few quarters now based on shipping from backlog, in some case fairly aged backlog, that our distribution of growth by region and by industry segment is more a factor of the backlog than the current underlying demand. And you're correct that we do expect the highest growth region to be the Americas going forward. With respect to the impact of stimulus, we're still in the early innings there. The business that we're winning there is really just ramping up. We saw some good development in the second half of last year. But by far, there's more business to come based on the projects that we're tracking.\nNick Gangestad: And, Julian, the question on the book to bill, yes, your math is right. Approximately 90% book to bill for the full year below that in the first half of the year and above that in the second half of the year.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Julian.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nBlake Moret: Hi, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: So we got about thousands questions on backlog, so why not have one more? So the 0.9x book to bill for the full year seems to suggest that we're going to be down sort of the low $3 billion for the year -- by the end of '24. I'm wondering, do we go below that level first half once distributors' kind of stop cutting inventories and then rebuild? Just wondering where you see the backlog stabilizing?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, we see the backlog stabilizing, I think I said this on the last quarter earnings call as well, that at 30% to 35% of annualized revenue is what we think is the normalized backlog level we will be at given the mix of our businesses that we have.\nBlake Moret: So that would indicate an exit of the fiscal year at above $3 billion.\nNick Gangestad: Correct.\nNigel Coe: Okay. And that is consistent with what you've said as well. And then just on sort of the -- and Nick, we're talking about $1.4 billion of orders in the fourth quarter fiscal, if you can just kind of verify that, that'd be helpful. And then on the FY '24 bridge, a couple of things. FX, you're assuming 1.5 points of a tailwind. The math we're getting is probably more like a minus one for the full year. So just wondering where are we wrong there? And then on the Lifecycle Services margin expansion, I think it makes sense if based on history, but just wondering what drove improving margins there in '24?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, I'll try to do those in reverse order. In terms of the things drawing down the margin in the fourth quarter, the two main things were our restructuring actions that had an outsized impact on the Lifecycle Services as well as the increased bonus expense that we were facing. Now as we flipped into '24, the bonus expense will be a tailwind to all businesses and Lifecycle Services margin will benefit from that. But also from the actions that we took in 2023, we think those will also be a propellant of Lifecycle Services margin expansion into '24. On the currency side, given our mix of businesses and what we're projecting, many of the currencies were just using what the current spot rate is going forward. In some currencies, such as the euro, what we will use is a group of banks and what they're expecting for a particular currency in the coming year. And so roughly 1.5% year-on-year benefit is coming from our expectations for currencies in fiscal year '24. And then in terms of the orders, we haven't been giving it by quarter. We did say orders were 8.2 billion for the full year. At the midpoint of the year, we had said they were 4.8 billion. And therefore, we're at 3.4 billion in the second half of the year. The third quarter was above that average, the average of 1.7 was above that. Fourth quarter was slightly below that level. So we saw from Q3 to Q4, it goes down further. But we haven't been giving it by quarter what our orders are.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Thanks, Nick, helpful.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSteve Tusa: Hi. Good morning.\nBlake Moret: Good morning.\nNick Gangestad: Hi, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Just on the bridge, can you just maybe -- the incentive comp is a big tailwind, it make sense. It was a headwind this year. Can you just maybe help us with how that breaks out in the first and second quarter here? What type of tailwind you expect there?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. First, for the full year, I'll just actually say actual numbers. Our total bonus expense in fiscal year '23 is approximately $240 million. And in our plans for fiscal year '24, it's dropping to $120 million. And that expectation of $120 million, that's spread exactly equally across the four quarters of '24. In '23, that $240 million was -- I can give you the actual numbers of how that broke out, Steve, if that helps.\nSteve Tusa: Yes.\nNick Gangestad: 50 million in Q1, 58 million in Q2, 56 million in Q3 and 80 million in Q4.\nSteve Tusa: Wow, great detail. Thanks for that. On the orders, how much of the headwind were actual cancellations? I'm not sure I caught that earlier. What the actual cancellation number was?\nBlake Moret: Yes, the cancellations were in a similar range to what we've been talking about, which is to say they were not the major contributor to the orders, a decrease. The main contributor by far to the orders decrease is the high inventory levels at the distributors. So cancellations were a relatively small piece of it. At this point, clearing those final golden screw or fourth wheel constrained components to be able to allow distributors to shift, complete bills and material is also a smaller component of the overall contributor to the orders down in Q4.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. One last one just on the bridge, the $0.25 of acquisition headwind is pretty big for the Clearpath business, given it's a relatively small revenue number. That's all kind of incremental investments you are making, or that's how much money the business is losing or what's driving that? So to heed, the $0.25 is a pretty big number.\nBlake Moret: Yes, Steve. First of all, as Nick said, we expect the Clearpath contribution to be accretive in fiscal year '26. This is an important strategic move for Rockwell, and one that I think will be apparent as we talk about it and demonstrate it next week. The dilution in fiscal year '24 is based on a combination of them ramping their capability. So think of it as somewhat of a startup mode, but also as making sure that we surround it with the right resources to fully integrate it as quickly as possible into Rockwell to be able to provide that value for customers. So that's not only the technical resources, but it's the commercial resources, it's the infrastructure to help them drive cost out of their operations and drive unit cost out of those AMRs. And so it is some additional investment from Rockwell's part to make sure that we integrate this really thoroughly, because this is a major milestone for us.\nSteve Tusa: Great. Thanks for the color, guys. Really appreciate the details.\nAijana Zellner: Abby, we will take one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nNoah Kaye: Okay. Thanks for all the details in the guide. Just one housekeeping item. What is the price rollover contribution for 2024, or what is the total contribution of price to organic growth for '24? And then what are you assuming for cost inflation?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. We are assuming that price growth will be slightly over 1% year-over-year. And in terms of input costs, we're expecting that to be very neutral year-over-year, causing the net price cost to be a little over 100 basis points accreted to margin.\nNoah Kaye: Perfect. Thanks, Nick.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session today. I will now turn the call back to Ms. Aijana Zellner for closing remarks.\nAijana Zellner: Thank you everyone for joining us today. That concludes our call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, you may disconnect. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Nick Gangestad",
            "content": "Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 9, fourth quarter key financial information. Fourth quarter reported sales were up 20.5% over last year. Q4 organic sales were up 17.7% and acquisitions contributed 140 basis points to growth. Currency translation increased sales by 140 basis points. About 6 points of our organic growth came from price.  Segment operating margin was 22.3% compared to 23.3% a year ago. The year-over-year decrease reflects the impact of higher sales volume and higher price being more than offset by higher incentive compensation, investment spend and restructuring actions.  Adjusted EPS of $3.64 was above our expectations, primarily due to higher organic sales, partially offset by higher investment spend and incentive compensation. We also took a restructuring charge in the quarter of just over $20 million, which is expected to yield more than $40 million of benefits on an annualized basis. All-in, adjusted EPS grew 20% versus prior year. I'll cover our year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide.  The adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 17%, slightly below the prior year rate. Free cash flow of $776 million was $417 million higher than prior year. Our strong free cash flow generation in the quarter was driven by higher income and reductions in working capital. As you know, due to supply chain volatility, we have seen working capital balances grow over the last couple of years. And we are pleased to see our action starting to bring working capital down.  One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased approximately 200,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $55 million. On September 30, $900 million remained available under our repurchase authorization.  Slide 10 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Blake discussed our top line performance in the quarter, so I'll focus on our margin performance. Given our pay-for-performance culture and strong results, all of our business segments saw higher bonus expense this year. In Q4, this represented between 200 and 300 basis points of year-over-year margin headwinds for each of the segments.  Intelligent devices margin decreased by 100 basis points year-over-year, and was up 450 basis points sequentially, because of higher volume. Within intelligent devices, we are investing in our next generation portfolio of drives in IO. Software and control margin of 33.5% decreased 100 basis points year-over-year.  Our strong Q4 margin was driven by 25% year-over-year top line growth. This is the segment with the highest share of incremental investment as we continue to invest in next generation logics performance and our cloud native software portfolio.  Lifecycle Services margin was 8.4% and was under the 10% exit rate we anticipated. In addition to a higher bonus, this segment was the most impacted by the restructuring charges taken in the quarter. Absent those two items, the margin for this segment came in as we planned.  Before moving to the adjusted EPS walk, I'd like to talk about our Sensia joint venture. Challenged by the pandemic and global supply chain constraints, this joint venture underperformed our initial expectations for 2020 through 2023. Our updated outlook, which includes this lower base, resulted in a partial goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter.  Sensia's one-time items and supply chain-related inefficiencies in recent quarters are largely behind us. Sensia delivered double digit top line growth in fiscal '23 and has strong orders growth, as Blake mentioned. Going forward, we expect profitable double digit growth from Sensia.  The next slide, 11, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q4 fiscal '22 to Q4 fiscal '23. Core performance was up $1.05 on a 17.7% organic sales increase. Incentive compensation was a $0.45 headwind. This year-over-year increase reflects the higher bonus payout this year versus a below target payout last year.  The year-over-year impact from currency was a $0.05 headwind offset by a $0.10 tailwind from interest expense. Share count and tax rate were each immaterial to the year-over-year change in EPS this quarter.  Slide 12 provides key financial information for the full fiscal year 2023. Reported sales grew 17% to $9.1 billion, including over one point coming from acquisitions. Currency negatively impacted sales by approximately $100 million or 1.4 points. Organic sales were up 17%.  Full year segment margin of 21.3% increased 140 basis points over last year. The increase was due to higher sales, partially offset by higher investment spend and higher incentive compensation. We accelerated growth investments for fiscal '23 above our original expectations as our revenue outperformed. Adjusted EPS was up 28%. A detailed year-over-year adjusted EPS walk can be found in the appendix for your reference.  As discussed earlier, free cash flow conversion was ahead of our expectations with free cash flow conversion of 86% in fiscal '23. Free cash flow increased $532 million since fiscal '22. The increase in free cash flow was driven by higher pre-tax income. Working Capital peaked in Q3 at 24% of sales and came down to 20% in Q4.  Return on invested capital was 20.9% for fiscal '23 and 570 basis points better than the prior year, primarily driven by higher net income. For the year, we deployed about $850 million of capital towards dividends and share repurchases and made inorganic investments of $170 million. We also paid down debt by about $870 million. Our capital structure and liquidity remains strong. This strength is what allowed us to fund our acquisitions in the first quarter of fiscal year '24 without any new long-term debt.  Before we turn to our fiscal '24 guidance, we want to update you on Q4 orders and our current thinking as we look forward. In Q4, orders decreased quicker than we expected as machine builders and distributors continued to work through inventory in response to our rapidly improving lead times. As Blake said, we believe Q4 was the trough and orders in October support that view. We expect fiscal year '24 orders to grow low single digits with an order profile similar to what we discussed in Q3. Let's now move on to the next slide, 13, guidance for fiscal '24. In fiscal year '24, we are focusing on growing earnings, even in a year of low top line growth. At the same time, we'll continue to invest in our own resilience, in our most important innovation projects to extend our differentiation and in customer-facing resources to capitalize on continuing strong secular demand for automation.  We expect our reported sales growth to range from 0.5% to 6.5%. We expect organic sales growth in the range of negative 2% to positive 4%. We expect acquisitions to add 100 basis points to growth, in addition to a full year currency tailwind of 150 basis points. From a segment perspective, given our exceptionally strong backlog execution in software and control that resulted in 25% top line growth in fiscal year '23, we expect this segment to see the lowest growth in fiscal year '24. We expect positive organic sales growth in both our Intelligent Devices and Lifecycle Services segments.  We expect price will be a positive contributor to growth for the year. Segment margin will be around 21.5%, up slightly from fiscal year '23. This includes a 60 basis point headwind coming from the acquisitions of Clearpath and Verve. Verve's impact to adjusted EPS is relatively flat in fiscal year '24.  Clearpath will reduce earnings per share in fiscal year '24 by $0.25 on an unlevered basis. This impact reflects continued R&D and commercialization investments as well as integration expenses. We expect the Clearpath acquisition to become accretive to earnings in fiscal year '26. We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. Our adjusted EPS guidance range is $12.00 to $13.50.  We expect full year fiscal '24 free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. This reflects our expectation that inventory days on hand will drop to 125 days by the end of fiscal year '24 compared to approximately 140 days of inventory we had at the end of fiscal year '23. Our outlook for cash tax payments is higher due to a tax payment for realized capital gains on the sale of our stake in PTC and higher tax payments required under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We expect free cash flow conversion in the first half to be well below 100%, mostly tied to the timing of our incentive compensation payout and income tax payments.  From a calendarization perspective, we expect year-over-year organic sales to grow in the low single digits in Q1, followed by sequential growth in sales volume as we progress through the year. As a result of our strong Q4 backlog performance, volumes will be down from Q4 to Q1. Given this dynamic, Q1 is projected to be our lowest margin quarter with sequential improvement throughout the year.  For the full year, let's turn to Slide 14 for our adjusted EPS walk. Our core is expected to have a modest positive impact on earnings of about $0.05 from fiscal year '23 to fiscal year '24. Structural productivity from our Q4 actions is expected to increase earnings by $0.25, while increased growth investments will reduce earnings by $0.55.  Incentive compensation for fiscal year '23 was above target due to strong performance. So this represents a tailwind of $0.85 for fiscal '24. Acquisitions will be dilutive by $0.25. Our 150 basis points of sales growth from currency will add $0.25, and the net of interest tax and shares will contribute about $0.05.  A few additional comments on fiscal '24 guidance. Corporate and other expense is expected to be around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal '24 is expected to be about $115 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.3 million shares. We expect to deploy between $300 million and $500 million to share repurchases during the year.  With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Good morning, Scott. Hi, Andy. Yes. In terms of expectations by segment for fiscal year '24, we do expect that Lifecycle Services will be the most significant year-on-year margin expander. And to answer your question, we are highly competent in that based on the actions that we have taken in '23 and based on the outlook we have for that business in '24. On the opposite side, software and control, we saw outstanding growth in fiscal year '23, as we had strong execution on our backlog. And we expect that business to be the one with the lowest organic growth and then that will translate into lower year-on-year margin in our software and control business, primarily driven by that lower growth. And it happens to also be the segment where we're putting the majority of our incremental investments. From an Intelligent Devices perspective, that's one where we expect the margins year-on-year to be flat to up slightly. And that is with the impact of Clearpath in there. Clearpath is for this segment alone about 100 basis point headwind. And that will be impacting throughout the year. But we'll definitely be seeing that impact in Q1 in Intelligent Devices. And the actions that we've been doing in Intelligent Devices around our productivity and our investments in products, that's what's leading us to expect margins to be flat to up slightly. Yes. And, Jeff, just to go a little deeper in that, what we're seeing -- one of the dynamics we're seeing in Q4 and we expect to continue through Q1 as well is our channel partners, our distributors working to right size their inventory as we are seeing -- as they are seeing good reductions in our lead times. They're doing the right actions of bringing their inventory levels down. And that's resulting in lower orders being placed on us. And we expect that to continue through Q1. And we think Q2, as we -- and as we discuss with all of our distributors, Q2 is where that will start to change where the inventory levels at our distributors will be reaching the normal level that they expect. So partly I say that just to say, we don't really see this level of orders we're seeing now as normalized. We're seeing them the correct reaction to the actions they're taking to bring their inventory levels down. And, Jeff, to follow up on the one question about why Q1, why we think that will be low single digit growth? Yes. If we were only looking at the orders, your question would -- that would make sense why not negative. However, we also continue to have a 4.1 billion backlog that we're entering the year with. And so what we're seeing in our Q1 revenue is a combination of continued sales of some of that backlog coupled with the lower orders we're expecting in Q1. Good morning, Andrew. Julian, thanks for asking that question. Q1 organic growth year-on-year we think will be low single digits. On the margin question, Q1 of last year, we had a margin of 20%. We expect that to be lower year-on-year in fiscal year '24. And there's three things that are going to be mainly contributing to it being lower. One is our Clearpath acquisition and the impact that will have. The second is mix that we see a less favorable mix in the first quarter of the products that we will be selling. And we think we'll be having lower utilization in our factories as we're adjusting our production to these lower orders. And we think those three things in combination are going to be resulting in lower margin year-on-year. And, Julian, the question on the book to bill, yes, your math is right. Approximately 90% book to bill for the full year below that in the first half of the year and above that in the second half of the year. Yes, we see the backlog stabilizing, I think I said this on the last quarter earnings call as well, that at 30% to 35% of annualized revenue is what we think is the normalized backlog level we will be at given the mix of our businesses that we have. Correct. Yes, I'll try to do those in reverse order. In terms of the things drawing down the margin in the fourth quarter, the two main things were our restructuring actions that had an outsized impact on the Lifecycle Services as well as the increased bonus expense that we were facing. Now as we flipped into '24, the bonus expense will be a tailwind to all businesses and Lifecycle Services margin will benefit from that. But also from the actions that we took in 2023, we think those will also be a propellant of Lifecycle Services margin expansion into '24. On the currency side, given our mix of businesses and what we're projecting, many of the currencies were just using what the current spot rate is going forward. In some currencies, such as the euro, what we will use is a group of banks and what they're expecting for a particular currency in the coming year. And so roughly 1.5% year-on-year benefit is coming from our expectations for currencies in fiscal year '24. And then in terms of the orders, we haven't been giving it by quarter. We did say orders were 8.2 billion for the full year. At the midpoint of the year, we had said they were 4.8 billion. And therefore, we're at 3.4 billion in the second half of the year. The third quarter was above that average, the average of 1.7 was above that. Fourth quarter was slightly below that level. So we saw from Q3 to Q4, it goes down further. But we haven't been giving it by quarter what our orders are. Hi, Steve. Yes. First, for the full year, I'll just actually say actual numbers. Our total bonus expense in fiscal year '23 is approximately $240 million. And in our plans for fiscal year '24, it's dropping to $120 million. And that expectation of $120 million, that's spread exactly equally across the four quarters of '24. In '23, that $240 million was -- I can give you the actual numbers of how that broke out, Steve, if that helps. 50 million in Q1, 58 million in Q2, 56 million in Q3 and 80 million in Q4. Yes. We are assuming that price growth will be slightly over 1% year-over-year. And in terms of input costs, we're expecting that to be very neutral year-over-year, causing the net price cost to be a little over 100 basis points accreted to margin."

            "name": "Blake Moret",
            "content": "Thanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our fourth quarter results on Slide 3. We delivered strong double digit growth this quarter, with both sales and adjusted earnings growing by over 20% year-over-year. Our solid execution and improving supply chain helped us exceed our Q4 expectations, resulting in double digit sales growth across all regions and business segments.  With lead times significantly improving across our product lines, we were able to deliver products to customers faster than expected this quarter, contributing to over $2.5 billion in total sales. This record shipment reflects Rockwell's continued capacity investments, and demonstrates our organization's ability to scale for sustained growth.  Total sales were up 20.5% versus prior year. Organic sales grew almost 18% year-over-year. Currency translation and acquisitions each contributed about a 1.5 of growth in the quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the split of our sales by business segment, region and industry was largely driven by the composition of our backlog.  In our intelligent devices business segment, organic sales increased 18% versus prior year with strong growth across all regions. Within this segment, Independent Cart Technology had another strong quarter, finishing this fiscal year with over 50% growth in sales. This offering continues to be an integral part of our advanced material handling and production logistics offering.  We are excited about our latest addition to this differentiated portfolio with our acquisition of Clearpath Robotics, and I will cover some strategic highlights of this deal later on the call. Software and control organic sales grew 23% year-over-year.  We continue to innovate in both the software and hardware portions of our architecture, with significant new offerings such as high availability, process IO, FactoryTalk optics, and FactoryTalk data mosaics. We are pleased with how our organic and inorganic investments in this business are delivering new customer value and continued share gains.  Lifecycle Services organic sales were up over 10% year-over-year. Book to bill in this segment was 0.97 and above the historical average for Q4. Within this segment, our Sensia joint venture had a strong finish to the year with over 50% year-over-year order growth in the quarter. This growth was driven by strategic wins in process automation and artificial lift control systems, positioning this business for continued double digit growth and improved profitability in fiscal year '24.  Information Solutions and Connected Services sales grew 10% versus prior year. One of the largest Information Solutions wins ever was with Prometeon Tyre, a global leader in tyre manufacturing headquartered in Italy. This customer was already using our cloud native Plex quality management system, and has recently selected our on-prem MES software to digitize the manufacturing processes at a number of their global sites. This win not only demonstrates the standalone differentiation of our modular offerings, but also highlights the value from the integration of our entire portfolio, making it easier for customers to standardize their global operations.  Within Connected Services, we continue to grow our cybersecurity practice with Q4 sales growing 30% year-over-year. Our industrial cybersecurity software and expertise along with differentiated partnerships on the IT security front are helping us grow our cybersecurity services into a business of well over $100 million this fiscal year, with a significant portion of this being recurring revenue. Total annual recurring revenue grew 16% year-over-year. That's a good number, and ARR is a meaningful contributor to our future growth framework.  Segment margin of 22.3% was in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $3.64, which is a company record for quarterly earnings, grew almost 20% year-over-year. Significantly improving lead times in our Q4 shipment over performance contributed to rapid backlog production in the quarter. We are ending the year with over $4.1 billion in backlog, over 40% coverage of annual sales, which is still well above pre-pandemic levels. A return to superior customer service remains our highest priority.  Let's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q4 end market performance. Our discrete sales grew over 15% versus prior year. Within discrete, automotive sales were up 30% year-over-year, reflecting continued strength of our offerings in both electric vehicle and battery. Our EV business was close to 40% of our total automotive revenue in the quarter, growing double digits both year-over-year and sequentially.  One of our strategic battery wins was with Nanotech Energy, a startup with new and innovative energy storage technologies. Nanotech has chosen Rockwell as their exclusive automation partner to build new battery Gigafactories. Semiconductor sales grew high single digits. We continue to take share in facilities management control system applications and major semiconductor companies across the globe.  In addition to our existing portfolio, we continue to win and build down a strong funnel of advanced wafer transport solutions, leveraging our Independent Cart Technology across customers' greenfield and brownfield projects. We're also participating in the rapid build down of data centers to support cloud computing and artificial intelligence.  Our control systems are used to control and optimize the environment and safety systems in these facilities. And our recent CUBIC acquisition extends our reach into the power distribution portion of data centers. We've seeing some strategic wins in Asia and in the U.S. in the quarter with more to come.  In our e-commerce and warehouse automation vertical, sales declined mid-single digits versus prior year. After several quarters of customer delays and cancellations in the e-commerce portion of this vertical, we're starting to see new investments, especially in North America, positioning us for low single digit year-over-year growth in fiscal year '24.  Turning to our hybrid industries, strong sales in this segment were paced by good growth in food and beverage, our largest customer vertical. Food and beverage sales grew low double digits versus prior year. In addition to continued cybersecurity and infrastructure modernization wins in this vertical, we had several wins in Q4 incorporating generative AI functionality, where our digital services business is helping our CPG customers use real-time AI assistance as they develop new products, formulations and recipes.  Life Sciences sales grew mid single digits in the quarter. This vertical is a great example of how we are delivering expanded customer value through a combination of software, hardware and digital services capabilities. This quarter, our PlantPAx system was selected by [indiscernible], a global biotechnology company developing innovative and affordable cancer medicines for their process control and environmental monitoring solutions at a greenfield site in New Jersey. Tire was up high teens in the quarter with multiple wins across the globe, including the large software deal at Prometeon Tyre I mentioned earlier on the call. Moving to process. Sales in this industry segment grew over 25% year-over-year, led by strong growth in oil and gas, mining and metals. Oil and gas sales were up over 30% in the quarter. This growth was driven by a combination of digital oilfield solutions, including process safety and lift control in EMEA and Asia, as well as several new carbon capture wins in North America. We continue to grow our process industry footprint with the combination of Sensia and Rockwell oil and gas capabilities.  We had a notable win this quarter at Multitex Filtration Engineers, an India headquartered global EPC company working on onshore and offshore projects. This was a competitive DCS win for Rockwell, with one of the largest government-owned oil and gas explorer and producers in India. And we are excited to partner with Multitex as they increase their footprint in the U.S. and Middle East. Turning now to Slide 5 and our Q4 organic regional sales. Once again our sales by region in Q4 and for the full year fiscal year '23 reflect the composition of our backlog rather than the underlying customer demand. Our full year orders in the Americas outperformed the rest of the world. North America organic sales were up over 12% year-over-year, but Latin America and EMEA sales grew over 20% in the quarter and Asia Pacific was up over 31%. While we saw strong sales growth in China in fiscal year '23, we continue to see high order deferrals and cancellations in China. Let's move to Slide 6, key highlights of fiscal year 2023. We had a record year of sales and earnings with our total sales exceeding $9 billion. We achieved this milestone ahead of the timeframe we anticipated when we introduced our framework for accelerated profitable growth at Investor Day in 2019. Both reported and organic sales grew 17% this year, well above our original expectations.  Information Solutions and Connected Services were up 9% year-over-year, reaching over $870 million, demonstrating our customers' accelerated adoption of new digital offerings. This is almost 3x what this figure was in 2018. Total ARR grew 16% with strong growth in both our software-as-a-service and recurring services offerings. Our strong operating performance resulted in 140 basis points of segment margin expansion versus prior year. Adjusted EPS of $12.12 was up 28%. We generated a record $1.2 billion of free cash flow this year. The much better free cash flow conversion in the quarter was primarily driven by improved working capital. This represents 86% free cash flow conversion for the year, and Nick will provide more detail in his remarks. And last but not least, we continue to invest in key areas of growth. In the last few months, we made two acquisitions, Clearpath and Verve, to further expand our value and accelerate top line growth.  While we'll talk more about those investments at our upcoming Investor Day, let's turn to Slide 7 and take a few minutes to share why we are excited about the impact Clearpath will have on both our near and longer term growth. As we've shared with you earlier in the quarter, Clearpath is a leader in autonomous mobile robots, or AMRs, serving customers across many industry segments.  Their differentiated portfolio of auto brand AMRs is focused on the production logistics space, where customers traditionally have relied on manual labor to move raw materials and subassemblies to the right place on production lines, and also to move finished goods to shipping docks and warehouses. These workflows have been identified by many automotive companies, semiconductor fabs, and consumer packaged goods suppliers as their top opportunity for efficiency and increased safety.  Given the workforce shortage and skills gap, along with the overall move to more autonomous operations, the market for industrial mobile robots in factory floor applications is expected to grow over 30% for the next five years, and we believe no one is better positioned to capitalize on this growth than Rockwell and Clearpath. Together, we are the only end-to-end provider of autonomous operations in this space.  We'll bring together our FactoryTalk design capabilities to configure and simulate the production environment, including these AMRs, integrate with our cloud native operations management software, like Plex and Fiix, and optimize the production process with our logics and embedded AI capabilities, all with one technology platform.  This is an important milestone for Rockwell, and you will see more of what this can do for industrial operations at Automation Fair and Investor Day next week. We closed this acquisition in early October and expect it to contribute about a point of growth to our top line performance in fiscal year '24.  As we move to Slide 8, let's review our fiscal 2024 outlook. Consistent with what we shared with you on our last earnings call, our orders continued to decrease in fiscal 2023 reaching what we believe to be a trough in our fourth quarter. Orders for the full year were $8.2 billion. We expect fiscal year '24 orders to increase low single digits year-over-year. Order growth is expected to be highest in the Americas. Asia orders are expected to be down year-over-year due to China. However, a relatively low exposure to China helps to reduce the impact on our global results.  The lead times on our products have largely returned to pre-pandemic levels, with the remainder of our SKUs getting back to normal lead times around the end of our fiscal Q1. This addresses the final golden screw constraints to shipping past due backlog and clearing committed inventory at our distributors. Based on our analysis of lead time reduction by product line, distributor inventory and underlying demand at our largest machine builders and end users, we expect orders to begin to recover in Q1 and build in Q2.  Customers continue to move forward with plans for both greenfield and brownfield capacity investments and also with resilience projects requiring increased cybersecurity and digitization. In the U.S., we've been adding commercial resources specifically focused on projects that are incented by recent stimulus authorized by legislation, including infrastructure, IRA and the CHIPS and Science Act. This team won new business during the second half of fiscal year '23 with the strong funnel of additional projects expected to close in fiscal year '24.  Our fiscal '24 guidance assumes total reported sales of about $9.4 billion at the midpoint. Organic sales are projected to grow 1% at the midpoint. Currency is expected to increase sales by 1.5% and acquisitions are slated to contribute about a point of growth. We are projecting ARR to have another year of double digit growth. Segment margin is expected to increase slightly versus prior year. Nick will cover this in more detail later.  Adjusted EPS is slated to grow 5% year-over-year at the midpoint. At a high level, we expect strong conversion on slightly higher year-over-year organic sales. Good performance in reducing backlog during Q4 of fiscal '23 put forward about $100 million of revenue and $0.25 of earnings. Clearpath is expected to reduce fiscal year '24 adjusted earnings by a similar amount.  Let me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q4 performance and financial outlook for fiscal '24. Nick? Thanks, Nick. As I reflect on 2023, it's clear our continued investments in talent and technology are paying off. I'm proud of how our tight knit organization has navigated through a dynamic environment and helped us deliver a record year of sales and earnings exceeding expectations. Looking at the year ahead of us, we are aware of the macroeconomic backdrop and the geopolitical situation that continues to change every day. You heard us talk today about focusing and optimizing our workforce productivity so that we can continue investing in key areas of growth.  Our customers rely on our continued innovation and differentiation to provide energy and critical infrastructure security across the globe to help bring new life saving drugs to market and to use leading technology to augment and enable their workforce.  We look forward to seeing a lot of you at our Investor Day in Boston next week, where we will be sharing our long-term business strategy and some of the most exciting developments across our key markets and applications.  Aijana will now begin the Q&A session. Good morning, Scott. Sure. So just for context, China's about 6% of our worldwide sales, so big manufacturing economy but relatively low exposure for Rockwell there. And we saw very strong sales in China for the year. But in China, the orders were lower. And that is the source of the cancellations that we did see. While our worldwide cancellations are roughly in line with what we've been seeing, China is the highest component of that. And I would say it's broad based. It's not one particular industry. We still see wins and investments in areas like EV, but the distributors that most of our products go to market through in China still have relatively high inventories and they're working that off. Sure, Scott. So we launched the entity with at the time Schlumberger a few months before the pandemic, so that was in 2019. And the lower base that resulted from COVID shutdowns and the subsequent supply chain shortages along with a refinement of some of the original mix assumptions caused us to take the impairment. We've changed out the management team at Sensia. And we've seen the last couple of quarters of encouraging improvement. We have great orders, good backlog, and improving profitability. And so we expect over the next few years that Sensia will actually be quite a large contributor to the improved profitability in Lifecycle Services. Thanks, Scott. Hi, Andy. Sure. Thanks, Andy. So first of all, in terms of the orders development, we saw orders ramp up throughout Q4. And then we saw October orders up sequentially from that, and supportive of our view that Q4 was the trough. We expect orders to continue recovering throughout Q1 and building in Q2. So that's the view in terms of the orders development. And that's based on what we're seeing what I just described, as well as direct discussions with our end users and machine builders that have the largest contribution to our business. So we went and did a detailed analysis of their CapEx expectations, their OpEx expectations, what projects that we have the opportunities with. And that coupled with our own personal views and with our distributor feedback are all supportive of this shape of the order recovery curve. In terms of the mega projects, I don't know that that's going to contribute so much to the lumpiness. I think it's going to be a positive, additional amount of business that builds throughout fiscal year '24 and beyond. The majority of the projects that we're tracking, and we're tracking literally hundreds of projects that are incented by some of the recent stimulus, the majority of those projects have not made a decision or have not released the automation equipment. So when you look at those projects, certain equipment, which would probably include switchgear, things like that, would be led earlier in the project cycle with automation to follow after that. So we think that we're still in the early innings with respect to those mega projects. And our tracking processes and our early wins are very encouraging. Thanks, Andy. Hi, Jeff. Sure. Let me make a couple of comments, Jeff. And then Nick may have some to add as well. So we saw orders increasing. If you look at beginning of the quarter of Q4 to the end, we saw orders exit at a higher rate than at the beginning of Q4, and then with a good uptick from that sequentially in October. So that was the ramp we were talking about, and why we believe that Q4 was the trough for orders. And if I can add to that. So our distributors are seeing a higher level of incoming orders than they in turn are placing on us due to their high inventory levels. So we have, as you would imagine, very good visibility into our distributors' incoming orders from their customers, from their end users and the machine builders. And that order activity is higher than what they're in turn placing on us. So that gives us additional confidence that orders will ramp up as their inventory situation comes down. Sure. So at the negative end, you would see a slower reduction of inventories at our distributors and a deterioration in the macro. At the upper end of the range, you would see distributors stabilizing their inventory at higher levels than they did before. So getting back to that equilibrium and placing orders that are more reflective of the underlying demand from users and integrators and machine builders. And you would also see at the high end some of the impact from the big projects being spurred by stimulus, specifically in the U.S. I should add as well that on the high end if we talk about total sales, some of the performance in terms of new acquisitions I think there's some opportunity there as well. Yes. And if I could just add one additional piece. We do expect shipments to ramp sequentially in terms of volume through the year. You get into a little bit of the math of comparables based on having such strong shipments at the tail end of the year that enters into the math of the year-over-year growth as well. Thanks, Jeff. Good morning. Yes. I think that would contemplate push outs that turn into cancellations quite frankly, whereas if a project is pushed by a couple of months, it's not going to have a big impact in the year. But if some of those projects or a larger amount of those projects rolled over into deferrals or cancellations, if people said [indiscernible] just kidding about EV, we don't need to build out the semiconductor industry process, which is 35% of our business, if people aren't looking to increase energy, both hydrocarbon and renewable energy forms in the U.S. If we saw a significant reduction of those projects, I think that would contribute to that minus -- that downside part of the range. Yes, we're looking at 15% ARR. And we're very proud of that ARR number, because it's broad based. It's not just the newer acquisitions like Plex and Fiix, but it's our traditional offerings as well, some of the on-prem software. And as we go through the year, based on overall Rockwell, we do expect ARR to increase to above 9% of our total sales in the year. It's a combination, both of the software as well as the high value recurring services. We made some organizational changes to supercharge that area. And that along with some of the new developments and offerings that we have, make us very optimistic about the contribution that ARR is going to have to our overall growth. And obviously, we like the resiliency that it gives our results by not starting each year at zero with respect to software sales. Thanks, Andrew. Let me start with the Americas discussion and then Nick can follow up with a little bit on the book to bill. So the Americas actually outpaced the rest of the world with respect to orders. And we expect that to continue in fiscal year '24. We've talked about for a few quarters now based on shipping from backlog, in some case fairly aged backlog, that our distribution of growth by region and by industry segment is more a factor of the backlog than the current underlying demand. And you're correct that we do expect the highest growth region to be the Americas going forward. With respect to the impact of stimulus, we're still in the early innings there. The business that we're winning there is really just ramping up. We saw some good development in the second half of last year. But by far, there's more business to come based on the projects that we're tracking. Thanks, Julian. Hi, Nigel. So that would indicate an exit of the fiscal year at above $3 billion. Good morning. Yes, the cancellations were in a similar range to what we've been talking about, which is to say they were not the major contributor to the orders, a decrease. The main contributor by far to the orders decrease is the high inventory levels at the distributors. So cancellations were a relatively small piece of it. At this point, clearing those final golden screw or fourth wheel constrained components to be able to allow distributors to shift, complete bills and material is also a smaller component of the overall contributor to the orders down in Q4. Yes, Steve. First of all, as Nick said, we expect the Clearpath contribution to be accretive in fiscal year '26. This is an important strategic move for Rockwell, and one that I think will be apparent as we talk about it and demonstrate it next week. The dilution in fiscal year '24 is based on a combination of them ramping their capability. So think of it as somewhat of a startup mode, but also as making sure that we surround it with the right resources to fully integrate it as quickly as possible into Rockwell to be able to provide that value for customers. So that's not only the technical resources, but it's the commercial resources, it's the infrastructure to help them drive cost out of their operations and drive unit cost out of those AMRs. And so it is some additional investment from Rockwell's part to make sure that we integrate this really thoroughly, because this is a major milestone for us."

Later on the call, we will open up the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations and Market Strategy. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead.\nAijana Zellner: Thank you, Julianne. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include and our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. So with that, I'll hand it over to Blake.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our third quarter results on Slide 3. We saw good double-digit growth in both sales and earnings this quarter as component shortages continue to ease. Lead times also continued to reduce across our product lines with recovery to pre-pandemic lead times expected for all products by the end of the calendar year. We did miss almost a week of planned shipments in May because of a longer-than-expected changeover to a new third-party logistics supplier at our North American distribution center. Shipments from this distribution center recovered in June and we now have higher capacity in place for Q4 fiscal year 2024 and beyond. Both total and organic sales grew over 13% versus prior year with currency and acquisitions roughly netting each other out. Currency translation decreased sales by less than a point and acquisitions contributed over a point of growth this quarter. Similar to prior quarters, the split of our sales by business segment, region and industry was largely driven by the composition of our backlog. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales were up 8% versus prior year. The changeover in our distribution center had the biggest impact on this segment in the quarter. Within the Intelligent Devices segment, Independent Cart Technology continues to be a disruptive technology, and we had several more strategic material handling wins in the U.S. this quarter. The recent launch of our On-Machine Armor Kinetix motion control products adds to our innovative material handling portfolio. We also had an important win in Europe with SIDEM, one of the world's leading desalination companies where our PowerFlex drives and services expertise are helping this customer deliver economical and sustainable drinking water to millions of people in developing regions. Software & Control organic sales grew over 24% year-over-year. Logix sales were almost 40% this quarter, reflecting the strong differentiation of our control platform and the continued benefits from supply chain resiliency investments we've made over the last year. Another example of our many ways to win within Software & Control is recent success at a well-known global parcel delivery company, where the combination of our awesome industrial PCs ThinManager and View software unseated a long-standing competitor as the customer standardizes its North America facilities on a Rockwell visualization platform. Lifecycle Services organic sales increased 8% versus prior year. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.08, led by strong orders in Sensia and our services business. Sensia had another good quarter of orders and sales with multiple large deals across EMEA and Asia. We also delivered higher sequential margins in Lifecycle Services this quarter. Information Solutions & Connected Services sales grew 10% versus prior year. We had multiple wins across our entire Information Solutions portfolio in Q3 and including both our on-prem and cloud-native software. This quarter, one of the world's top tire manufacturers located in Asia-Pacific, selected Rockwell's FactoryTalk production center to develop its new global MES platform. Another important IS win in Asia was with a Japanese global leader in HVAC where our cloud-native Plex platform is being deployed on Microsoft Azure at one of their greenfield plants. The customer chose our SaaS solution to quickly start up a manufacturing execution and quality management system without the need for extensive on-premise hardware, software and support. We saw Plex synergy wins continue to ramp up in the quarter as our strong market access machine is contributing to new SaaS logos. In the quarter, we saw the benefits of our software partnership with PTC with numerous recurring revenue wins through a combination of our Digital Services business and PTC's ThingWorx visualization platform. Also regarding PTC, we continue to monetize the investment we made in 2018. We now own less than 5% of total shares outstanding and in accordance with the terms of our agreement, I\u2019m stepping off of their Board. Our commercial relationship remains strong and was extended in June. In Connected Services, we had an important cybersecurity win with ADNOC, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. This customer is leveraging our network of security services and expertise along with an intrusion detection system from our partner Dragos to help secure its network infrastructure and comply with cyber governance regulations. Our total annual recurring revenue grew a very strong 17% year-over-year this quarter. Segment margin of 21.1% was flat to last year and in line with our expectations despite the shipment shortfall. Adjusted EPS grew over 13% year-over-year. Backlog is beginning to reduce as lead times improve. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q3 end market performance. Our discrete sales were up about 10% versus prior year. Within discrete automotive sales grew mid-teens year-over-year. One of the notable customer wins here this quarter was with the Korean Tier 1 supplier working on an EV battery project for a European brand owner. This customer is using our core automation offerings including motion control to provide tooling for battery thermal management. Another automotive win this quarter was with Jaguar Land Rover where Rockwell was selected to support the JLR electrified architecture for three of their EV body shops in the UK. Semiconductor sales grew high-teens this quarter, building on strength over the last few quarters, we continue to see broader adoption of our wafer transport solutions by the world\u2019s leading semiconductor manufacturers. This quarter, we also had an important Plex win in semiconductor at SOC, Saudi Arabia as the customer implements our smart manufacturing platform at its site in Riyadh. In e-commerce and warehouse automation sales were down high-teens versus prior year, driven by continued delays in some cancellations at our e-commerce customers. Moving to our hybrid industry segment. Sales in this segment grew 15% year-over-year led by strong growth in food and beverage and tire. Food and beverage sales were up mid-teens versus prior year. We continue to see both greenfield and brownfield investments in this vertical. With one of our most important multi-year wins this quarter focused on a customer\u2019s global fleet modernization program, a leading global food processing company is standardizing over 50 of its sites on our PlantPAx control platform. This competitive DCS win is a testament to our progress in process control applications in both technology and domain expertise. Life sciences sales grew mid-single digits versus prior year. This industry continues to see strong investments in CapEx and OpEx projects across all regions, both in traditional pharmaceuticals and newer advanced therapy, medicinal products. We had a strategic win with Biosero a member of the BICO Group in North America where our combined technologies increased the speed and accuracy of new drug development. Biosero selected our independent cart technology to automate lab workflows for a cell and gene therapy program. Tire was up over 35% in the quarter. Turning to process industries. Process sales were up 15% year-over-year led by growth in oil and gas and mining. Turning now to Slide 5 in our Q3 organic regional sales. As I said earlier, our growth by region this quarter and for the full year fiscal year 2023 reflects the composition of our backlog rather than the underlying customer demand. North America organic sales grew about 2% year-over-year against higher comps. Latin America was up 7%. Through Q3, our orders in the Americas are outpacing the rest of the world. EMEA sales grew 34% and Asia-Pacific was up over 44%. We did see an uptick in order cancellations in China this quarter. Let\u2019s now move to Slide 6 fiscal 2023 outlook. We are confident that shipments in the fourth quarter will recover the shortfall in Q3 caused by the distribution center change. Shipments in July were in line with our forecast for the full year. Our fiscal 2023 guidance assumes a total reported sales growth range of 14% to 16%, and we continue to expect organic sales growth of 15% at the mid-point. We now expect the impact from acquisitions and currency to offset each other. Nick will cover this in more detail later. We have said all along that we expect further normalization of ordering patterns as lead times and constrained products improve, and that\u2019s what we are seeing right now. With improving lead times, machine builders do not need as many months of products on order and are no longer placing unusually large advanced orders. Their incoming orders and front log remain strong and improving component lead times will help them improve their cash flow. We also expect distributor restock orders will pick up as they receive the last constrained items that allow them to clear their committed inventory and complete customer orders. Our order cancellation rates remain low. We now expect our full year fiscal year 2023 orders to be in the $8.5 billion to $9 billion range. Given this updated order outlook, we now expect to finish the year with about $4.5 billion to $5 billion in backlog with about 80% of that backlog shippable in fiscal year 2024. We expect organic ARR to grow 15%. Segment margin is expected to increase by 160 basis points year-over-year. We are increasing the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 and now expect adjusted EPS to grow 25% versus prior year and we now expect 80% free cash flow conversion due to higher working capital. Let me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q3 performance and financial outlook for fiscal 2023. Nick?\nNick Gangestad: Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start on Slide 8, third quarter key financial information. Third quarter reported sales were up 13.7% over last year. Q3 organic sales were up 13.2% and acquisitions contributed 120 basis points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by 70 basis points, about three points of our organic growth came from price. Segment operating margin expanded to 21.1% and was in line with our expectations as improved productivity offset lower than expected sales. The 30 basis point year-over-year increase in margin was driven by higher sales, volume and positive price cost partially offset by higher investment spend. Corporate and other expense was $32 million in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $3.01 was below our expectations due to our shift in shipments from Q3 to Q4. Adjusted EPS grew 13% versus prior year. I\u2019ll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was 14.1% and in line with the prior year. Free cash flow of $240 million was $87 million lower than prior year, driven by increases in working capital and income tax payments, partially offset by higher pre-tax income. The increase in working capital was primarily driven by higher accounts receivable and inventory. Inventory grew by six days, primarily in finished goods as a result of the shift in planned shipments from Q3 to Q4. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased approximately 220,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $62 million. On June 30, $1 billion remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Organic sales growth was led by software and control, which grew 24% year-over-year. Turning to margins, intelligent devices margin decreased by 290 basis points year-over-year due to higher investment spend, unfavorable mix and higher incentive compensation, partially offset by positive price cost. Segment margin for software and control increased 340 basis points compared to last year on higher sales volume and positive price cost partially offset by higher investment spend. We continue to accelerate top line growth and profitability from acquisitions in the past few years, including Plex, Fiix and ASEM. Lifecycle services margin was similar to last year and improving sequentially through the year as planned. Our focus on productivity is yielding benefits now and into the coming quarters. We continue to expect lifecycle services margin to expand sequentially and exceed 10% in Q4. The next slide, 10, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q3 fiscal 2022 to Q3 fiscal 2023. Core performance was up $0.90, excluding increased investment spend of $0.35 on a 13.2% organic sales increase. Incentive compensation was a $0.20 headwind. This year-over-year increase reflects the higher expected bonus payout this year versus a below normal payout last year. The year-over-year impacts from tax, interest expense, currency and share count were each immaterial to EPS this quarter. Before we turn to our fiscal 2023 guidance, let\u2019s spend a few minutes talking about our orders trends on Slide 11. We think it will be helpful to provide more color on our orders progression over the last couple years and going forward. First, in fiscal 2020, we saw reduced orders caused by the constraints on customers operations and uncertainty that the pandemic created. Then in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, we saw increased orders driven by the combination of three things. First, historically high levels of investment in certain verticals like EV and semi, as well as an increasing need for more automation to address workforce shortages and business resiliency. Second, catch up on projects that many of our customers deferred during fiscal year 2020. And three, large advance orders due to extended lead times caused by component shortages. In fiscal year 2023, we are continuing to see strong underlying demand, but we are now seeing the long anticipated moderation in orders driven by our improving lead times for products. As we stated earlier, we expect lead times to continue to normalize in the next two quarters and we expect virtually all of our product lead times to be back at pre-pandemic levels by the end of calendar year 2023. Once our lead times are back at normal levels, we expect customer orders to closely align with the strong underlying demand. I think it\u2019s worth noting that over the fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2023 time period encompassing the ups and downs of the order cycle, we will have grown revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 8% plus a backlog that is more than tripled during that timeframe. Let\u2019s now move to the next Slide 12, guidance for fiscal 2023. We are increasing the midpoint of our reported sales guidance from 14.5% to 15%. We expect organic sales growth in the range of 14% to 16% and we now expect a full year currency headwind of 100 basis points, 50 basis points better than our previous guidance. This updated outlook reflects the weakening of the U.S. dollar in recent weeks. We continue to expect volume to add 10 points of growth and price to add 5 points of growth, and we still expect full year segment operating margin to be about 21.5% unchanged from prior guidance. Our updated guidance still assumes full year core earnings conversion of close to 40%. We continue to expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17.5%, unchanged from our prior guide. We are narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance range to $11.70 to $12.10. This increases the midpoint of our EPS guidance to $11.90, up $0.05 from prior guidance and up 25% from last year. The $0.05 increase is driven by currency. We now expect full year fiscal 2023 free cash flow conversion of about 80% of adjusted income. This updated guidance reflects the new calendarization of our revenue and our updated projection of inventory days on hand. We do expect our inventory days on hand to drop by the end of the year to 125 days. This will be lower than the approximately 130 days of inventory we had at the end of fiscal year 2022, but will likely not reduce to the 112 days we originally expected. Our outlook for cash tax payments also increased as we realized capital gains on our sales of PTC shares. Income tax payments tied to these gains are reflected in our free cash flow results. A few additional comments on fiscal 2023 guidance. Corporate and other expense is still expected to be around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2023 is still expected to be about $130 million, and we\u2019re still assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.6 million shares. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake?\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Nick. As we continue to stay close to end users, machine builders and distributors, a few key themes emerge. First, demand remains strong. We\u2019ve mentioned softness in e-commerce and in parts of the Chinese economy, but investment by end users and machinery builders continues across the majority of regions and serve verticals. Second, the global supply chain is improving, but it will take some months to flush the inefficiencies that have built up over the last few years, especially inventory. This is seen at machine builders, distributors and in our own operations. Third, the opportunities for automation to play a strategic role in our customer success have never been higher. Workforce scarcity, American shoring of manufacturing and the premium being placed on business agility are all positive reads for Rockwell. We\u2019re moving fast to meet these needs with new capacity and capabilities. It\u2019s hard to believe, but our Annual Automation Fair and Investor Day are only about three months away, and you should look forward to hearing more about the exciting next leg of our journey. I want to thank all our employees and also our unmatched distributors who have worked so hard to bring us to this point and who collectively make the difference at our customers. Aijana will now begin the Q&A session.\nAijana Zellner: We would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Julianne, let\u2019s take our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone.\nBlake Moret: Hey, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Blake or Nick, can you give us more color into the order of visibility you have that allowed you to construct Slide 11. If I add all the timing, it looks like you expect a relatively significant orders inflection higher, maybe even in the first half of 2024. And it also looks like you think orders could reach the peak levels again, that you saw in 2022. Is that what you\u2019re attempting to say? And then what markets would you most likely see an uptick in bookings?\nBlake Moret: Yes. Andy, there\u2019s a few factors that contribute to that outlook for orders. First are the continued high investment levels and some important verticals for us. We see continued investments as we track new CapEx announcements in areas like semiconductor, in EV, in renewables, while we see a general focus on automation at many of our other verticals like food and beverage, life sciences, energy and so on. We also have had a number of conversations with customers and distributors that give us a consistent view that demand remains strong. As I and members of my team have talked directly to machine builders and end users, they\u2019re all proceeding with plans based on the consistent demand for their products. We described in my remarks what we\u2019re seeing in terms of machine builders who are not placing the unusually large advanced orders that they did of say a year ago. And we\u2019ve also had direct conversations with our distributors and in North America, some of our largest distributors are actually seeing year-over-year order increases. So again, that consistently strong demand picture informs that view that we showed you on Slide 11 of orders recovering, complimenting the remaining strong backlog.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Thanks for that Blake. And then Nick, can you quantify how much impact the change in U.S. distribution you made had on sales and earnings in Q3? And then specifically could you go over how to think about margin moving forward for your segments? It looks like you talked about the change impacting intelligent devices, but moving forward should we be thinking 20% to 21% for that segment, which was your prior guide? And then conversely, software margin continues to go up, can you sustain mid-30% margins in that segment?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. As far as the sales impact, we had originally planned when we guided what we expected for growth expectations between Q3 and Q4, we had expected some disruption. We were planning close to a week of disruption that this would be causing in the loss of capacity during our third quarter. That ended up extending by several more days in terms of the total impact it had on us. All in something in the range of $50 million to $100 million of revenue is I think a good ballpark to think about of what we\u2019re seeing of a shift of revenue there between the third and fourth quarter from what we were anticipating three months ago. And then in terms of margin progression, Andy, for the rest of this year, we continue to expect that margins will expand. We think fourth quarter margins will be our highest margin for the year. We continue to expect to see strong margins in our Software and Control business, something similar to what we\u2019ve been seeing the last couple quarters. And as I\u2019ve said for the last couple quarters, we expect sequential margin improvement in lifecycle services. We expect that will be over 10% in Q4. And then intelligent devices as we recapture some of that revenue that shifted from Q3 to Q4, we think added revenue there will be bringing that margin up from where we were in the third quarter. All in, we still expect ITV smart intelligent devices margin to be a little under 20% for the full year, software and control to be well over 30% and lifecycle services will be below 10% for the full year. And it\u2019ll be similar to a little less than what it was in fiscal 2022. But all in progressing nicely with the focus we\u2019re having on productivity there.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Thanks, Nick.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning all.\nBlake Moret: Hey Josh.\nNick Gangestad: Hey Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Blake, so just on the order normalization and customers, including some of the OEMs adapting to shorter lead times. I sort of get that that\u2019s kind of a \u2013 maybe a bit of a one-time accordion squeeze as those folks don\u2019t need to go out the same length of time or even pull that in. Any sense of sizing what that is? What that impact might be on that implied second half order outlook? Just trying to distinguish between the supply chain and sort of the back end of that phenomenon versus maybe what run rate orders might be?\nBlake Moret: Yes. I mean giving a little bit more color on how this plays out, during the most constrained period of component shortages, we saw some OEMs that were placing orders for a year or more of their equipment demand, where in normal times when lead times were at, let\u2019s say normal for the products that they put in their equipment, that might be only three or four months of demand. Now, that\u2019s not across the board, but we did see cases of those larger orders. As the lead times have recovered actually a little bit faster than we expected over the last quarter or so and as we expect them to continue to improve, then we see OEMs no longer needing to place such long orders. And as they focus, as I said, on flushing some of the inventory and WIP that they have in their operations, importantly, their front log remains strong. And as I visited machine builders and my staff has visited machine builders over the last couple of months that\u2019s a consistent message that their demand remains strong. It\u2019s just they don\u2019t need to place such a large block of orders. Now, I want to put this in perspective. OEMs are in the neighborhood of a third of our business. So we don\u2019t see the same patterns or need for those large orders at users, but that is an effect that\u2019s impacted our machine builders. And in a little bit of a similar timeframe with our distributors, their inventories will relieve as they get those last constrained items over the next couple of months and are able to shift their committed inventory that\u2019s inventory that\u2019s already been committed to specific end user projects.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe for a follow-up, just want to take a step back. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of \u2013 there are a lot of elements of the business now where you can sort of see this before and after in terms of investment. We talk a lot about nearshoring, energy transition, you see process orders looking strong on that. But I can\u2019t help notice that 30% of the business is food and bev and consumer packaged goods, where I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s quite as obvious that we\u2019re seeing nearshoring or some fundamental breakout. I know you called out a bigger food and bev win. But maybe just talk about how that piece of the business has seen a secular shift or perhaps hasn\u2019t? If you want to put backlog in context or anything else that would be helpful.\nBlake Moret: Sure. So you\u2019re right. I mean that as part of our Hybrid Industry segment is the single largest segment of our end market demand. And what we\u2019re seeing in food and beverage and home and personal care is an increased focus on efficiency and resilience. So even though we don\u2019t see the same amount of greenfield investment that we do say with electric vehicles or batteries, those big food and beverage companies are investing in their resilience. So they\u2019re adding some measure of redundancy. They\u2019re investing heavily in OT cybersecurity, which is one of our very fastest growing businesses and meaningful multimillion dollar orders. They\u2019re also dealing with workforce shortages. So we\u2019re all aware that unemployment remains very low. And I think in general, that's a positive read for us, but it creates continuing problems with these manufacturers in staffing those lines. And so they're looking for augmenting the technology that we're providing with highly trained workers as those workers are more scarce. And we're seeing our offering result in some important competitive wins. We've added more ways to win. So it's not just our core technology, it's our cybersecurity services, and we talked about several wins with Plex as the synergy wins ramp up there as we turn on that market access machine. So those are some of the things that are driving the good food and beverage and home and personal care growth that we're seeing this year.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Understood, appreciate it. Best of luck.\nBlake Moret: Yes, thanks Josh.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks very much. Maybe not taking a step back. If we look at Slide 11, you've got the order trends line chart there. Trying to think about backlog-to-sales coverage and where you think that normalizes. As you said, pre-COVID you were 20% odd backlog to sales. Recently, you've been well over 50%, but that will come down. And I just wondered your sort of best views on where it settles out. Because I guess, if we look at some of your peers like FANUC, they've all seen this huge orders slump as well, and they're talking about customer inventory depletion through next year. And I guess, one could also make the case perhaps that more localized supply chains can mean shorter lead times and order patterns, not longer ones. So just wondered sort of your perspectives on that and testing that conviction around why the orders improve from early calendar 2024?\nBlake Moret: Sure. I'll make a few comments, Julian, and then Nick may have some additional detail. As you think about the composition of our business, for a starting point, we said the backlog that we expect to finish the fiscal year in a couple of months with is remaining high between $4.5 billion and $5 billion, and 80% of that is shippable in fiscal year 2024. I think your question is, okay, how does that develop? And what is beyond that? Think about the product backlog as lead times return to normal for products at the end of this calendar year is getting back to its normal low levels of backlog. We traditionally looked at products as having lead times of days or weeks that either ships directly off our distributor shelves or we build it very quickly in our factories. And I think that gets back in fiscal year 2024. There's a portion of that product business within Intelligent Devices that is configured to order. And that continues to have lead times that are measured typically in weeks, sometimes in a couple of months. That business has been really strong for us here recently. We think we're gaining considerable share there. And so that's going to be a somewhat meaningful component of backlog even after 2024 within the Intelligent Devices area. And then as Lifecycle Services becomes bigger, continues to grow, then we typically have seen somewhere in the neighborhood of half a year of backlog for Lifecycle Services. So backlog becomes smaller as we leave fiscal year 2024, but it remains considerably larger than the $1.5 billion or so that you remember from pre-pandemic. Because we're a bigger company and we have some of these new components, I would also say there's software and recurring revenue that continues to grow nicely. We talked about ARR growing 17% this quarter. And so that's a part of the equation as well. Nick?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. And Julian, to frame it up a little in the way you asked the question where pre-pandemic backlog closer to 20% of our revenue and more recently this year where we're around 50% or higher than 50%. I don't \u2013 based on the things Blake was just describing, I don't think it will go back down to 20%. But something in the 30% or low 30s percent. I think that's a reasonable estimation right now for us, Julian, of where to think where our backlog is in a more normal state.\nJulian Mitchell: That's very helpful. Thanks. And I appreciate it's very difficult to call. Thank you for the thoughts. Maybe on the areas or markets where you're seeing or expecting the most severe orders normalization, do we assume it's mostly discrete markets globally? I think China, there's obviously some orders pressure that your peers have talked about, but is it sort of a global phenomenon across various discrete markets? Is that the way to think about it?\nBlake Moret: Yes. I think it's the phenomenon that we described with machine builders, which is not exclusively in discrete. We have a good business with skilled OEMs, process machine builders as well, but they're buying product. It's less weighted towards engineered solutions. So I think that's where you've seen that phenomenon as they were placing orders for a year or sometimes more of their machine coverage, and they don't need to do that anymore. And so they're looking at opportunities to improve their cash flow, get the existing equipment out as the constrained products from us deliver and then to fill their forward machine needs with smaller orders because they can depend more on the lead times.\nJulian Mitchell: Great, thank you.\nBlake Moret: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning. Hello, everyone.\nBlake Moret: Hi, Jeff.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Good morning. Sorry if I missed it. I was on a few minutes late, but a lot of talk about future backlog. But could you just square us up on where the backlog actually ended in the quarter, and also kind of what the price volume complexion was in the actual quarter?\nNick Gangestad: Jeff, I'll take the second part of your question first. Of our 13% organic growth, 10% of that was volume and 3% of that was price. And it was very much like as we expected. This was the quarter where we are starting to lap ourselves against the more significant price increases that we were realizing in the second half of our fiscal year 2022. In terms of the backlog, we haven't put out a specific number on it, Jeff. It did come down some in Q3, and we expect it to come down further in Q4 to that $4.5 billion to $5 billion range. But we haven't put a specific number on that, partly weaning ourselves off of like frequent updates on all of that, but giving you a trend of where that's going.\nJeff Sprague: Okay. Great. Yes, it's just helpful to have the anchor if we're going to talk about the future, right. So we can all relate to that in future conversations, but I get it. And then just on investment spending, is there actually a change in the year outlook on how you'll \u2013 the level of investment spending or just a timing between quarters?\nNick Gangestad: Jeff, investment spend is staying almost exactly where we've been expecting, both for the year and by quarter actually. It's very, very much following our plan.\nJeff Sprague: Okay, great. I'll leave it there. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrew Obin: Hi, guys, good morning. Can you hear me?\nBlake Moret: Yes, Andrew.\nNick Gangestad: Hey, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Hey, just as you think about it seems that you are about to embark on a multi-year growth spurt. How should we think \u2013 how do you guys think about your cash conversion just structurally going forward? Do you just need to accept permanently lower cash conversion? We just need to invest in working capital and growth, and if not, what levers can you pull to sort of get it back to this 95% level that we've had?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. Andrew, thanks for that question. The \u2013 our longer-term plan and expectation is that we should be at 100% free cash flow conversion or averaging that, that over time, even in a period where we are growing more substantially than we have, I\u2019ll say pre-pandemic. And with where we stand now with our working capital, where we\u2019re estimating it to exit fiscal year 2023, we think that creates some tailwinds for us in cash conversion in the next couple years for us that even in a higher growth world, we can still be generating something from an operational standpoint closer to the 100% free cash flow conversion. There are a couple headwinds, I\u2019ll just want to make sure you\u2019re aware of Andrew. One is we are at the point now where we are making more substantial cash tax payments on the transition tax that was part of TCJA. Some companies adjust that out of their free cash flow conversion. We don\u2019t \u2013 we keep that in there. And we\u2019re also being impacted by the recent requirement that we capitalize for tax purposes, our R&D expense, and that that\u2019s having a several percentage point between 5 and 10 percentage point impact to our free cash flow conversion in the next few years. It\u2019s something after five years or six years we work our way through, that just becomes part of the base, but it is having that between 5% and 10% impact to free cash flow conversion. And then the last I\u2019ll note is as we\u2019ve been liquidating our PTC shares, realizing the gain, the nuances of how free cash flow reporting is that gain is not part of our denominator in that equation, but the cash taxes is part of that \u2013 of the numerator in that equation, and it\u2019s just a nuance in pointing out that has impacted us this year and could impact us in coming quarters as well. But I\u2019ll call those more noise versus your underlying question, I think on our \u2013 the ability of our business model to be generating 100% free cash flow conversion.\nAndrew Obin: Great. And then just on your ARR I think 17% very healthy. Could you give us a look sort of under the hood what the components are, which portions of your business is doing better? Maybe talk about MES, talk about Fiix, Plex, whatever it is you guys want to talk about, but just give us a sense of what\u2019s driving the software growth. Thank you.\nBlake Moret: Sure. So I mentioned a few wins with Plex in the quarter. And Plex has continued to be a good performer for us both in terms of the expansion of existing customers, as well as new logos where Rockwell\u2019s market access gave us opportunities there. So Plex was a strong performer in the quarter. Fiix as well with the asset management. These are two SaaS applications that are doing quite well for us, and contributed substantially to that 17% ARR I mentioned some wins with PTC. Those are subscription wins. And those were some major competitive victories for us in the quarter. And then on the high value services side, cybersecurity services, and I\u2019ve talked about that that\u2019s been right at the top of our fast growing businesses and we have a recurring revenue component of cyber. So those things were probably at the top of the list and contributing to what you\u2019re right, was really good ARR in the quarter.\nAndrew Obin: Thanks so much.\nBlake Moret: Yes. Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSteve Tusa: Hi, good morning.\nBlake Moret: Hey, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, can we just start \u2013 can you just remind us, I mean, you guys were relatively \u2013 we never really had this orders discussion before COVID, what, like, your book-to-bill was generally like around one back then, right? Is that about right?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Steve, that, that is correct. The only exception is our lifecycle services business component that could have some nuances from quarter-to-quarter, but generally we were pretty much a one-to-one book-to-bill.\nSteve Tusa: Right. So like eating in the backlog this quarter, you mentioned, so obviously your orders were like what were they like a little bit above two or something like that?\nBlake Moret: Yes. We haven\u2019t given the specific order value for Q3, but we gave the full year expectation of $8.5 billion to $9 billion of orders.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And when we look at this kind of like daily order volume, I mean, like that, that would kind of equate to the quarterly order numbers I would think, because that\u2019s not like scaled or adjusted for seasonality or anything like that, right?\nNick Gangestad: That that is correct. We\u2019re not adjusting for any seasonality here.\nSteve Tusa: Yes. Okay. That, that, that\u2019s fair. And then just the last question, just philosophically, you guys went from like not really giving orders to maybe not even \u2013 not disclosing them this year at one point, I think you guys were thinking about that. Now you\u2019re disclosing them and now you\u2019re kind of like forecasting them. I guess, are we going to continue to get this level of color as we go through the next couple of quarters? Like maybe like just philosophically any view on like maybe normalizing some of this disclosure billion it just seems like there\u2019s more provided, but it\u2019s in different forms and it just seems like it\u2019s not particularly as straightforward as maybe it could be.\nBlake Moret: So Steve, we\u2019re continuing to provide the information that we think is most important to investors and over the last few years, as you said, orders have become a more important component as they have decoupled from shipments at different times. And so we felt it was important to provide that additional information. As we look at going forward, we\u2019re going to continue to look at where orders remain material to investor decisions and to provide that kind of information. And we continue to look at how we\u2019re making decisions about running the business going forward and providing you some insight into that. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s going to take some different forms as time goes on, because the value of it and the horizon of that I think are important. So this quarter we made the decision to give a little bit of a view going forward and showing on that Slide 11, the relationship between orders and big macro events going forward so that you and investors can put that into perspective.\nSteve Tusa: Yes. And it is helpful. So we thank you for all the extra disclosure here regardless. So thanks Aijana for that. Really appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nNoah Kaye: Thanks for taking the question. I just want to go to lifecycle services, several quarters continuing of positive book-to-bill. You commented on margins for this year. How do we think about incremental margins going forward, especially as you start to get this sort of richer mix, right? I know a lot of revenue associated with what comes out of this ends up in SMC but just help us think about incremental margins going forward.\nNick Gangestad: Yes. As I think about where we\u2019re going with margins in our lifecycle services business in the next couple years, we expect that lifecycle services will be an outsize contributor to our margin expansion in the coming years. So we \u2013 one way we think about our margin expansion is through our core conversion of the 30% to 35% range. That would imply that lifecycle services is going to be helpful to that number. So if as I look over the next couple of years, I believe lifecycle services will be our highest margin expansion business segment of the three segments.\nBlake Moret: Yes. And I would say that, the Sensia contribution, which is in lifecycle, we have seen improvement there and we expect to see continued improvement. So that\u2019s a major component.\nNoah Kaye: Thanks. And maybe just want to step back and ask a broader question about the demand environment. In past quarters, you and the industry and trade press and all sorts of folks have talked about the long runway here from IRA, IIJA shoring all these trends. And when you look at a quarter like this and see, some of the order dynamics and understand a lot of that\u2019s just supply chain normalizing. I guess, when we step back, where do you think we kind of are in this wave of manufacturing investment and specifically in the United States?\nBlake Moret: Yes. I think \u2013 I like looking at a vertical by vertical approach of this, because it breaks it down into, I\u2019d say, more objective components EV and battery by any objective measure, there is continued strong investment as people are building out the capacity to build more electric vehicles. If you look at any city in the U.S., the number of electric vehicles remains low, all projections of that\u2019s going to increase. And there\u2019s nowhere near as much capacity needed to serve that demand, even with the announcements of new greenfields that have already been made. So we see that as a multi-year trend, semiconductor for national security reasons and to be able to reduce geopolitical risk impacting the semiconductors that make our world go. We see that as a multi-year trend. And importantly, it\u2019s not just the fabs, it\u2019s all the supporting infrastructure that\u2019s needed to make that stick as well. We talk about redundancy and resiliency in some of the other industries, food and beverage, life sciences with offerings not just the core automation, but the additional software and the services. I think these are multi-year trends. Workforce, again, with unemployment as low as it is, it\u2019s just not possible to build the things that we need to preserve a standard of living without the technology augmenting a highly engaged workforce. Those two things are going to be required across a broad swath of the industries that we serve. So I think the outlook for automation remains good over a multi-year period. We\u2019re seeing the current impact of some of the ordering dynamics that we\u2019ve talked a lot about on this call, but the fundamental outlook for automation and Rockwell\u2019s ability to outperform, I think is very strong.\nAijana Zellner: Julianne, we\u2019ll take one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nNigel Coe: Aijana, thanks for fit me in here. Hi guys. Good morning. So yes, we\u2019ve covered a lot of ground here. But just North America was 1% organic, so even if we factor in the $50 million to $100 million impact from the DC, it still seemed quite weak. And I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some inventory headwinds there, but are we seeing any push out in projects, some of the larger projects in North America?\nBlake Moret: The main contributor to the growth in North America is really the composition of the backlog. And in fact, as we look at the orders in North America, they found pace the rest of the world year-to-date in fiscal year 2023. There are certainly anecdotes of projects that have been pushed, but we have not seen that as a prevalent trend and we continue to see low cancellation rates among within our backlog.\nNigel Coe: Okay. That\u2019s very clear. And then Nick, your comments on sort of what a normal backlog is, and obviously higher than what it\u2019s been in the past, but seems to suggest that we should be expecting backlog to maybe burn down towards maybe close to $3 billion. Is that fair?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. It\u2019s dependent on what revenue is, but for those reasons that that Blake went through in our mix, we just don\u2019t see it getting back to that 20% that it used to be, but something in the 30% to 35% range and yes, multiply that by our revenue, and that\u2019s our best estimate now. I think in the coming quarters, we\u2019ll keep learning more about that, but we ask for our best estimate right now. That\u2019s where we are.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Thanks guys. Cheers.\nNick Gangestad: Thank you.\nAijana Zellner: Thank you everyone for joining us today. That concludes today\u2019s conference call.\nOperator: At this time, you may disconnect. Thank you.",

            "name": "Nick Gangestad",
            "content": "Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8, third quarter key financial information. Third quarter reported sales were up 13.7% over last year. Q3 organic sales were up 13.2% and acquisitions contributed 120 basis points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by 70 basis points, about three points of our organic growth came from price. Segment operating margin expanded to 21.1% and was in line with our expectations as improved productivity offset lower than expected sales. The 30 basis point year-over-year increase in margin was driven by higher sales, volume and positive price cost partially offset by higher investment spend. Corporate and other expense was $32 million in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $3.01 was below our expectations due to our shift in shipments from Q3 to Q4. Adjusted EPS grew 13% versus prior year. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was 14.1% and in line with the prior year. Free cash flow of $240 million was $87 million lower than prior year, driven by increases in working capital and income tax payments, partially offset by higher pre-tax income. The increase in working capital was primarily driven by higher accounts receivable and inventory. Inventory grew by six days, primarily in finished goods as a result of the shift in planned shipments from Q3 to Q4. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased approximately 220,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $62 million. On June 30, $1 billion remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Organic sales growth was led by software and control, which grew 24% year-over-year. Turning to margins, intelligent devices margin decreased by 290 basis points year-over-year due to higher investment spend, unfavorable mix and higher incentive compensation, partially offset by positive price cost. Segment margin for software and control increased 340 basis points compared to last year on higher sales volume and positive price cost partially offset by higher investment spend. We continue to accelerate top line growth and profitability from acquisitions in the past few years, including Plex, Fiix and ASEM. Lifecycle services margin was similar to last year and improving sequentially through the year as planned. Our focus on productivity is yielding benefits now and into the coming quarters. We continue to expect lifecycle services margin to expand sequentially and exceed 10% in Q4. The next slide, 10, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q3 fiscal 2022 to Q3 fiscal 2023. Core performance was up $0.90, excluding increased investment spend of $0.35 on a 13.2% organic sales increase. Incentive compensation was a $0.20 headwind. This year-over-year increase reflects the higher expected bonus payout this year versus a below normal payout last year. The year-over-year impacts from tax, interest expense, currency and share count were each immaterial to EPS this quarter. Before we turn to our fiscal 2023 guidance, let's spend a few minutes talking about our orders trends on Slide 11. We think it will be helpful to provide more color on our orders progression over the last couple years and going forward. First, in fiscal 2020, we saw reduced orders caused by the constraints on customers operations and uncertainty that the pandemic created. Then in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, we saw increased orders driven by the combination of three things. First, historically high levels of investment in certain verticals like EV and semi, as well as an increasing need for more automation to address workforce shortages and business resiliency. Second, catch up on projects that many of our customers deferred during fiscal year 2020. And three, large advance orders due to extended lead times caused by component shortages. In fiscal year 2023, we are continuing to see strong underlying demand, but we are now seeing the long anticipated moderation in orders driven by our improving lead times for products. As we stated earlier, we expect lead times to continue to normalize in the next two quarters and we expect virtually all of our product lead times to be back at pre-pandemic levels by the end of calendar year 2023. Once our lead times are back at normal levels, we expect customer orders to closely align with the strong underlying demand. I think it's worth noting that over the fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2023 time period encompassing the ups and downs of the order cycle, we will have grown revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 8% plus a backlog that is more than tripled during that timeframe. Let's now move to the next Slide 12, guidance for fiscal 2023. We are increasing the midpoint of our reported sales guidance from 14.5% to 15%. We expect organic sales growth in the range of 14% to 16% and we now expect a full year currency headwind of 100 basis points, 50 basis points better than our previous guidance. This updated outlook reflects the weakening of the U.S. dollar in recent weeks. We continue to expect volume to add 10 points of growth and price to add 5 points of growth, and we still expect full year segment operating margin to be about 21.5% unchanged from prior guidance. Our updated guidance still assumes full year core earnings conversion of close to 40%. We continue to expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17.5%, unchanged from our prior guide. We are narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance range to $11.70 to $12.10. This increases the midpoint of our EPS guidance to $11.90, up $0.05 from prior guidance and up 25% from last year. The $0.05 increase is driven by currency. We now expect full year fiscal 2023 free cash flow conversion of about 80% of adjusted income. This updated guidance reflects the new calendarization of our revenue and our updated projection of inventory days on hand. We do expect our inventory days on hand to drop by the end of the year to 125 days. This will be lower than the approximately 130 days of inventory we had at the end of fiscal year 2022, but will likely not reduce to the 112 days we originally expected. Our outlook for cash tax payments also increased as we realized capital gains on our sales of PTC shares. Income tax payments tied to these gains are reflected in our free cash flow results. A few additional comments on fiscal 2023 guidance. Corporate and other expense is still expected to be around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2023 is still expected to be about $130 million, and we're still assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.6 million shares. With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake? Yes. As far as the sales impact, we had originally planned when we guided what we expected for growth expectations between Q3 and Q4, we had expected some disruption. We were planning close to a week of disruption that this would be causing in the loss of capacity during our third quarter. That ended up extending by several more days in terms of the total impact it had on us. All in something in the range of $50 million to $100 million of revenue is I think a good ballpark to think about of what we're seeing of a shift of revenue there between the third and fourth quarter from what we were anticipating three months ago. And then in terms of margin progression, Andy, for the rest of this year, we continue to expect that margins will expand. We think fourth quarter margins will be our highest margin for the year. We continue to expect to see strong margins in our Software and Control business, something similar to what we've been seeing the last couple quarters. And as I've said for the last couple quarters, we expect sequential margin improvement in lifecycle services. We expect that will be over 10% in Q4. And then intelligent devices as we recapture some of that revenue that shifted from Q3 to Q4, we think added revenue there will be bringing that margin up from where we were in the third quarter. All in, we still expect ITV smart intelligent devices margin to be a little under 20% for the full year, software and control to be well over 30% and lifecycle services will be below 10% for the full year. And it'll be similar to a little less than what it was in fiscal 2022. But all in progressing nicely with the focus we're having on productivity there. Hey Josh. Yes. And Julian, to frame it up a little in the way you asked the question where pre-pandemic backlog closer to 20% of our revenue and more recently this year where we're around 50% or higher than 50%. I don't \u2013 based on the things Blake was just describing, I don't think it will go back down to 20%. But something in the 30% or low 30s percent. I think that's a reasonable estimation right now for us, Julian, of where to think where our backlog is in a more normal state. Good morning, Jeff. Jeff, I'll take the second part of your question first. Of our 13% organic growth, 10% of that was volume and 3% of that was price. And it was very much like as we expected. This was the quarter where we are starting to lap ourselves against the more significant price increases that we were realizing in the second half of our fiscal year 2022. In terms of the backlog, we haven't put out a specific number on it, Jeff. It did come down some in Q3, and we expect it to come down further in Q4 to that $4.5 billion to $5 billion range. But we haven't put a specific number on that, partly weaning ourselves off of like frequent updates on all of that, but giving you a trend of where that's going. Jeff, investment spend is staying almost exactly where we've been expecting, both for the year and by quarter actually. It's very, very much following our plan. Hey, Andrew. Yes. Andrew, thanks for that question. The \u2013 our longer-term plan and expectation is that we should be at 100% free cash flow conversion or averaging that, that over time, even in a period where we are growing more substantially than we have, I'll say pre-pandemic. And with where we stand now with our working capital, where we're estimating it to exit fiscal year 2023, we think that creates some tailwinds for us in cash conversion in the next couple years for us that even in a higher growth world, we can still be generating something from an operational standpoint closer to the 100% free cash flow conversion. There are a couple headwinds, I'll just want to make sure you're aware of Andrew. One is we are at the point now where we are making more substantial cash tax payments on the transition tax that was part of TCJA. Some companies adjust that out of their free cash flow conversion. We don't \u2013 we keep that in there. And we're also being impacted by the recent requirement that we capitalize for tax purposes, our R&D expense, and that that's having a several percentage point between 5 and 10 percentage point impact to our free cash flow conversion in the next few years. It's something after five years or six years we work our way through, that just becomes part of the base, but it is having that between 5% and 10% impact to free cash flow conversion. And then the last I'll note is as we've been liquidating our PTC shares, realizing the gain, the nuances of how free cash flow reporting is that gain is not part of our denominator in that equation, but the cash taxes is part of that \u2013 of the numerator in that equation, and it's just a nuance in pointing out that has impacted us this year and could impact us in coming quarters as well. But I'll call those more noise versus your underlying question, I think on our \u2013 the ability of our business model to be generating 100% free cash flow conversion. Yes, Steve, that, that is correct. The only exception is our lifecycle services business component that could have some nuances from quarter-to-quarter, but generally we were pretty much a one-to-one book-to-bill. That that is correct. We're not adjusting for any seasonality here. Yes. As I think about where we're going with margins in our lifecycle services business in the next couple years, we expect that lifecycle services will be an outsize contributor to our margin expansion in the coming years. So we \u2013 one way we think about our margin expansion is through our core conversion of the 30% to 35% range. That would imply that lifecycle services is going to be helpful to that number. So if as I look over the next couple of years, I believe lifecycle services will be our highest margin expansion business segment of the three segments. Yes. It's dependent on what revenue is, but for those reasons that that Blake went through in our mix, we just don't see it getting back to that 20% that it used to be, but something in the 30% to 35% range and yes, multiply that by our revenue, and that's our best estimate now. I think in the coming quarters, we'll keep learning more about that, but we ask for our best estimate right now. That's where we are. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our third quarter results on Slide 3. We saw good double-digit growth in both sales and earnings this quarter as component shortages continue to ease. Lead times also continued to reduce across our product lines with recovery to pre-pandemic lead times expected for all products by the end of the calendar year. We did miss almost a week of planned shipments in May because of a longer-than-expected changeover to a new third-party logistics supplier at our North American distribution center. Shipments from this distribution center recovered in June and we now have higher capacity in place for Q4 fiscal year 2024 and beyond. Both total and organic sales grew over 13% versus prior year with currency and acquisitions roughly netting each other out. Currency translation decreased sales by less than a point and acquisitions contributed over a point of growth this quarter. Similar to prior quarters, the split of our sales by business segment, region and industry was largely driven by the composition of our backlog. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales were up 8% versus prior year. The changeover in our distribution center had the biggest impact on this segment in the quarter. Within the Intelligent Devices segment, Independent Cart Technology continues to be a disruptive technology, and we had several more strategic material handling wins in the U.S. this quarter. The recent launch of our On-Machine Armor Kinetix motion control products adds to our innovative material handling portfolio. We also had an important win in Europe with SIDEM, one of the world's leading desalination companies where our PowerFlex drives and services expertise are helping this customer deliver economical and sustainable drinking water to millions of people in developing regions. Software & Control organic sales grew over 24% year-over-year. Logix sales were almost 40% this quarter, reflecting the strong differentiation of our control platform and the continued benefits from supply chain resiliency investments we've made over the last year. Another example of our many ways to win within Software & Control is recent success at a well-known global parcel delivery company, where the combination of our awesome industrial PCs ThinManager and View software unseated a long-standing competitor as the customer standardizes its North America facilities on a Rockwell visualization platform. Lifecycle Services organic sales increased 8% versus prior year. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.08, led by strong orders in Sensia and our services business. Sensia had another good quarter of orders and sales with multiple large deals across EMEA and Asia. We also delivered higher sequential margins in Lifecycle Services this quarter. Information Solutions & Connected Services sales grew 10% versus prior year. We had multiple wins across our entire Information Solutions portfolio in Q3 and including both our on-prem and cloud-native software. This quarter, one of the world's top tire manufacturers located in Asia-Pacific, selected Rockwell's FactoryTalk production center to develop its new global MES platform. Another important IS win in Asia was with a Japanese global leader in HVAC where our cloud-native Plex platform is being deployed on Microsoft Azure at one of their greenfield plants. The customer chose our SaaS solution to quickly start up a manufacturing execution and quality management system without the need for extensive on-premise hardware, software and support. We saw Plex synergy wins continue to ramp up in the quarter as our strong market access machine is contributing to new SaaS logos. In the quarter, we saw the benefits of our software partnership with PTC with numerous recurring revenue wins through a combination of our Digital Services business and PTC's ThingWorx visualization platform. Also regarding PTC, we continue to monetize the investment we made in 2018. We now own less than 5% of total shares outstanding and in accordance with the terms of our agreement, I'm stepping off of their Board. Our commercial relationship remains strong and was extended in June. In Connected Services, we had an important cybersecurity win with ADNOC, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. This customer is leveraging our network of security services and expertise along with an intrusion detection system from our partner Dragos to help secure its network infrastructure and comply with cyber governance regulations. Our total annual recurring revenue grew a very strong 17% year-over-year this quarter. Segment margin of 21.1% was flat to last year and in line with our expectations despite the shipment shortfall. Adjusted EPS grew over 13% year-over-year. Backlog is beginning to reduce as lead times improve. Let's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q3 end market performance. Our discrete sales were up about 10% versus prior year. Within discrete automotive sales grew mid-teens year-over-year. One of the notable customer wins here this quarter was with the Korean Tier 1 supplier working on an EV battery project for a European brand owner. This customer is using our core automation offerings including motion control to provide tooling for battery thermal management. Another automotive win this quarter was with Jaguar Land Rover where Rockwell was selected to support the JLR electrified architecture for three of their EV body shops in the UK. Semiconductor sales grew high-teens this quarter, building on strength over the last few quarters, we continue to see broader adoption of our wafer transport solutions by the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers. This quarter, we also had an important Plex win in semiconductor at SOC, Saudi Arabia as the customer implements our smart manufacturing platform at its site in Riyadh. In e-commerce and warehouse automation sales were down high-teens versus prior year, driven by continued delays in some cancellations at our e-commerce customers. Moving to our hybrid industry segment. Sales in this segment grew 15% year-over-year led by strong growth in food and beverage and tire. Food and beverage sales were up mid-teens versus prior year. We continue to see both greenfield and brownfield investments in this vertical. With one of our most important multi-year wins this quarter focused on a customer's global fleet modernization program, a leading global food processing company is standardizing over 50 of its sites on our PlantPAx control platform. This competitive DCS win is a testament to our progress in process control applications in both technology and domain expertise. Life sciences sales grew mid-single digits versus prior year. This industry continues to see strong investments in CapEx and OpEx projects across all regions, both in traditional pharmaceuticals and newer advanced therapy, medicinal products. We had a strategic win with Biosero a member of the BICO Group in North America where our combined technologies increased the speed and accuracy of new drug development. Biosero selected our independent cart technology to automate lab workflows for a cell and gene therapy program. Tire was up over 35% in the quarter. Turning to process industries. Process sales were up 15% year-over-year led by growth in oil and gas and mining. Turning now to Slide 5 in our Q3 organic regional sales. As I said earlier, our growth by region this quarter and for the full year fiscal year 2023 reflects the composition of our backlog rather than the underlying customer demand. North America organic sales grew about 2% year-over-year against higher comps. Latin America was up 7%. Through Q3, our orders in the Americas are outpacing the rest of the world. EMEA sales grew 34% and Asia-Pacific was up over 44%. We did see an uptick in order cancellations in China this quarter. Let's now move to Slide 6 fiscal 2023 outlook. We are confident that shipments in the fourth quarter will recover the shortfall in Q3 caused by the distribution center change. Shipments in July were in line with our forecast for the full year. Our fiscal 2023 guidance assumes a total reported sales growth range of 14% to 16%, and we continue to expect organic sales growth of 15% at the mid-point. We now expect the impact from acquisitions and currency to offset each other. Nick will cover this in more detail later. We have said all along that we expect further normalization of ordering patterns as lead times and constrained products improve, and that's what we are seeing right now. With improving lead times, machine builders do not need as many months of products on order and are no longer placing unusually large advanced orders. Their incoming orders and front log remain strong and improving component lead times will help them improve their cash flow. We also expect distributor restock orders will pick up as they receive the last constrained items that allow them to clear their committed inventory and complete customer orders. Our order cancellation rates remain low. We now expect our full year fiscal year 2023 orders to be in the $8.5 billion to $9 billion range. Given this updated order outlook, we now expect to finish the year with about $4.5 billion to $5 billion in backlog with about 80% of that backlog shippable in fiscal year 2024. We expect organic ARR to grow 15%. Segment margin is expected to increase by 160 basis points year-over-year. We are increasing the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 and now expect adjusted EPS to grow 25% versus prior year and we now expect 80% free cash flow conversion due to higher working capital. Let me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q3 performance and financial outlook for fiscal 2023. Nick? Thanks, Nick. As we continue to stay close to end users, machine builders and distributors, a few key themes emerge. First, demand remains strong. We've mentioned softness in e-commerce and in parts of the Chinese economy, but investment by end users and machinery builders continues across the majority of regions and serve verticals. Second, the global supply chain is improving, but it will take some months to flush the inefficiencies that have built up over the last few years, especially inventory. This is seen at machine builders, distributors and in our own operations. Third, the opportunities for automation to play a strategic role in our customer success have never been higher. Workforce scarcity, American shoring of manufacturing and the premium being placed on business agility are all positive reads for Rockwell. We're moving fast to meet these needs with new capacity and capabilities. It's hard to believe, but our Annual Automation Fair and Investor Day are only about three months away, and you should look forward to hearing more about the exciting next leg of our journey. I want to thank all our employees and also our unmatched distributors who have worked so hard to bring us to this point and who collectively make the difference at our customers. Aijana will now begin the Q&A session. Hey, Andy. Yes. Andy, there's a few factors that contribute to that outlook for orders. First are the continued high investment levels and some important verticals for us. We see continued investments as we track new CapEx announcements in areas like semiconductor, in EV, in renewables, while we see a general focus on automation at many of our other verticals like food and beverage, life sciences, energy and so on. We also have had a number of conversations with customers and distributors that give us a consistent view that demand remains strong. As I and members of my team have talked directly to machine builders and end users, they're all proceeding with plans based on the consistent demand for their products. We described in my remarks what we're seeing in terms of machine builders who are not placing the unusually large advanced orders that they did of say a year ago. And we've also had direct conversations with our distributors and in North America, some of our largest distributors are actually seeing year-over-year order increases. So again, that consistently strong demand picture informs that view that we showed you on Slide 11 of orders recovering, complimenting the remaining strong backlog. Hey Josh. Yes. I mean giving a little bit more color on how this plays out, during the most constrained period of component shortages, we saw some OEMs that were placing orders for a year or more of their equipment demand, where in normal times when lead times were at, let's say normal for the products that they put in their equipment, that might be only three or four months of demand. Now, that's not across the board, but we did see cases of those larger orders. As the lead times have recovered actually a little bit faster than we expected over the last quarter or so and as we expect them to continue to improve, then we see OEMs no longer needing to place such long orders. And as they focus, as I said, on flushing some of the inventory and WIP that they have in their operations, importantly, their front log remains strong. And as I visited machine builders and my staff has visited machine builders over the last couple of months that's a consistent message that their demand remains strong. It's just they don't need to place such a large block of orders. Now, I want to put this in perspective. OEMs are in the neighborhood of a third of our business. So we don't see the same patterns or need for those large orders at users, but that is an effect that's impacted our machine builders. And in a little bit of a similar timeframe with our distributors, their inventories will relieve as they get those last constrained items over the next couple of months and are able to shift their committed inventory that's inventory that's already been committed to specific end user projects. Sure. So you're right. I mean that as part of our Hybrid Industry segment is the single largest segment of our end market demand. And what we're seeing in food and beverage and home and personal care is an increased focus on efficiency and resilience. So even though we don't see the same amount of greenfield investment that we do say with electric vehicles or batteries, those big food and beverage companies are investing in their resilience. So they're adding some measure of redundancy. They're investing heavily in OT cybersecurity, which is one of our very fastest growing businesses and meaningful multimillion dollar orders. They're also dealing with workforce shortages. So we're all aware that unemployment remains very low. And I think in general, that's a positive read for us, but it creates continuing problems with these manufacturers in staffing those lines. And so they're looking for augmenting the technology that we're providing with highly trained workers as those workers are more scarce. And we're seeing our offering result in some important competitive wins. We've added more ways to win. So it's not just our core technology, it's our cybersecurity services, and we talked about several wins with Plex as the synergy wins ramp up there as we turn on that market access machine. So those are some of the things that are driving the good food and beverage and home and personal care growth that we're seeing this year. Yes, thanks Josh. Sure. I'll make a few comments, Julian, and then Nick may have some additional detail. As you think about the composition of our business, for a starting point, we said the backlog that we expect to finish the fiscal year in a couple of months with is remaining high between $4.5 billion and $5 billion, and 80% of that is shippable in fiscal year 2024. I think your question is, okay, how does that develop? And what is beyond that? Think about the product backlog as lead times return to normal for products at the end of this calendar year is getting back to its normal low levels of backlog. We traditionally looked at products as having lead times of days or weeks that either ships directly off our distributor shelves or we build it very quickly in our factories. And I think that gets back in fiscal year 2024. There's a portion of that product business within Intelligent Devices that is configured to order. And that continues to have lead times that are measured typically in weeks, sometimes in a couple of months. That business has been really strong for us here recently. We think we're gaining considerable share there. And so that's going to be a somewhat meaningful component of backlog even after 2024 within the Intelligent Devices area. And then as Lifecycle Services becomes bigger, continues to grow, then we typically have seen somewhere in the neighborhood of half a year of backlog for Lifecycle Services. So backlog becomes smaller as we leave fiscal year 2024, but it remains considerably larger than the $1.5 billion or so that you remember from pre-pandemic. Because we're a bigger company and we have some of these new components, I would also say there's software and recurring revenue that continues to grow nicely. We talked about ARR growing 17% this quarter. And so that's a part of the equation as well. Nick? Yes. I think it's the phenomenon that we described with machine builders, which is not exclusively in discrete. We have a good business with skilled OEMs, process machine builders as well, but they're buying product. It's less weighted towards engineered solutions. So I think that's where you've seen that phenomenon as they were placing orders for a year or sometimes more of their machine coverage, and they don't need to do that anymore. And so they're looking at opportunities to improve their cash flow, get the existing equipment out as the constrained products from us deliver and then to fill their forward machine needs with smaller orders because they can depend more on the lead times. Yes, thank you. Hi, Jeff. Thanks, Jeff. Yes, Andrew. Sure. So I mentioned a few wins with Plex in the quarter. And Plex has continued to be a good performer for us both in terms of the expansion of existing customers, as well as new logos where Rockwell's market access gave us opportunities there. So Plex was a strong performer in the quarter. Fiix as well with the asset management. These are two SaaS applications that are doing quite well for us, and contributed substantially to that 17% ARR I mentioned some wins with PTC. Those are subscription wins. And those were some major competitive victories for us in the quarter. And then on the high value services side, cybersecurity services, and I've talked about that that's been right at the top of our fast growing businesses and we have a recurring revenue component of cyber. So those things were probably at the top of the list and contributing to what you're right, was really good ARR in the quarter. Yes. Thanks, Andrew. Hey, Steve. Yes. We haven't given the specific order value for Q3, but we gave the full year expectation of $8.5 billion to $9 billion of orders. So Steve, we're continuing to provide the information that we think is most important to investors and over the last few years, as you said, orders have become a more important component as they have decoupled from shipments at different times. And so we felt it was important to provide that additional information. As we look at going forward, we're going to continue to look at where orders remain material to investor decisions and to provide that kind of information. And we continue to look at how we're making decisions about running the business going forward and providing you some insight into that. And that's why it's going to take some different forms as time goes on, because the value of it and the horizon of that I think are important. So this quarter we made the decision to give a little bit of a view going forward and showing on that Slide 11, the relationship between orders and big macro events going forward so that you and investors can put that into perspective. Yes. And I would say that, the Sensia contribution, which is in lifecycle, we have seen improvement there and we expect to see continued improvement. So that's a major component. Yes. I think \u2013 I like looking at a vertical by vertical approach of this, because it breaks it down into, I'd say, more objective components EV and battery by any objective measure, there is continued strong investment as people are building out the capacity to build more electric vehicles. If you look at any city in the U.S., the number of electric vehicles remains low, all projections of that's going to increase. And there's nowhere near as much capacity needed to serve that demand, even with the announcements of new greenfields that have already been made. So we see that as a multi-year trend, semiconductor for national security reasons and to be able to reduce geopolitical risk impacting the semiconductors that make our world go. We see that as a multi-year trend. And importantly, it's not just the fabs, it's all the supporting infrastructure that's needed to make that stick as well. We talk about redundancy and resiliency in some of the other industries, food and beverage, life sciences with offerings not just the core automation, but the additional software and the services. I think these are multi-year trends. Workforce, again, with unemployment as low as it is, it's just not possible to build the things that we need to preserve a standard of living without the technology augmenting a highly engaged workforce. Those two things are going to be required across a broad swath of the industries that we serve. So I think the outlook for automation remains good over a multi-year period. We're seeing the current impact of some of the ordering dynamics that we've talked a lot about on this call, but the fundamental outlook for automation and Rockwell's ability to outperform, I think is very strong. The main contributor to the growth in North America is really the composition of the backlog. And in fact, as we look at the orders in North America, they found pace the rest of the world year-to-date in fiscal year 2023. There are certainly anecdotes of projects that have been pushed, but we have not seen that as a prevalent trend and we continue to see low cancellation rates among within our backlog."

Later in the call we will open up the lines for your questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations and Market Strategy. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead.\nAijana Zellner: Thank you, Julian. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's second quarter fiscal 2023 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website.

And with that, I\u2019ll hand over to the Blake.\nBlake Moret: Thanks Aijana. And good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our second quarter results on Slide 3. We had an outstanding quarter of strong growth in both sales and earnings. Our double-digit sales and margin growth continue to reflect Rockwell's strong execution and focus on business resiliency as well as overall improvement in electronic component availability. The demand for our differentiated offerings continue to be strong even in this uncertain economic environment. Through the first half of this fiscal year, our total orders were $4.8 billion, spread evenly between the 2 quarters once we adjust for the estimated price-related pull forward in our fiscal Q1. As expected, our order cancellation rates remain in the low single digits through April. Total sales grew over 25% versus prior year. Organic sales were up over 27% year-over-year and were above our expectations. Currency translation reduced sales by about 3% and acquisitions contributed over 1 point of growth this quarter. As in the prior quarters, the split of sales by business segment, region and industry, was largely driven by access to electronic components and the composition of our backlog. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales grew 27% versus prior year with broad-based growth across all businesses. We continue to see wider adoption of our independent cart technology in new applications across semiconductor, food and beverage and life sciences. One example of the new application is way for transport in semiconductor fabs. We continue to see increasing demand for this offering including important win with a large U.S company this quarter. These customer investing in modernizing and expanding its material handling systems and our independent cart technology helps increase wafer output and more efficiently utilizes existing fab space leading to increased capacity and significant savings. Software and Control organic sales increased over 40%. Strong growth versus prior year was led by logic, where we continue to see the benefits of our resiliency investments and an overall improvement in supply chain. Lifecycle Services organic sales were up 12% year-over-year. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.27, led by strong order intake in our Sensia business. Information Solutions and Connected Services sales grew about 10% versus prior year. We had another quarter of competitive multiyear wins across our software and cybersecurity services portfolio. Within Information Solutions, I am pleased with the increasing breadth of our new Plex customers as we continue to expand our SaaS, Smart Manufacturing platform to new industries and geographies. One of our Plex wins this quarter was with AB-InBev, the world's largest brewing company and its start-up business EverGrain, focused on upcycling grain by product into sustainable supply of nutritious food ingredients. Our modular and cloud-native Flix software is helping EverGrain quickly deploy mission-critical quality management capabilities today while providing the functionality for the business to scale in the future. In Connected Services, we saw another quarter of customer demand for our recurring cybersecurity and infrastructure as a service offerings as customers across many industries are continuing to invest in safety and security of their operations. One of these wins was with Darling Ingredients, a food processing company focused on reducing food waste by collecting and repurposing animal-based products. Our annual recurring revenue grew 15% year-over-year in Q2. Segment margin of 21.3% was up over 560 basis points year-over-year and was better than expected. Adjusted EPS grew over 81% year-over-year. We also completed the acquisition of Knowledge Lens this quarter, which adds significant scale to our Kalypso digital services business. Let's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q2 end market performance. Consistent with my earlier comments on the gradually improving supply chain environment, all 3 industry segments grew strong double digits versus prior year. Our discrete sales were up about 20% in the quarter. Within discrete, automotive sales grew over 40% versus prior year. We saw a number of strategic wins in EV and battery this quarter both in the U.S. and China, where a combination of our core automation and strong partner ecosystem helped edge out our biggest competitors. While some customers are optimizing operating costs in the near term, they still continue to invest in building out new capacity to meet their production goals. Semiconductor sales were up mid-teens year-over-year. I already mentioned one semiconductor win. Another example of how Rockwell is expanding our existing semi footprint now with wafer transport applications is our multiyear project win with analog devices. Our independent cart technology was chosen to automate ADI's material handling applications at several of their global fabs. By implementing our technology, ADI will improve operator productivity by at least 20% by moving away from manually delivering lots across the fab. In e-commerce and warehouse automation, our Q2 sales were down mid-single digits versus prior year. While we continue to see a pause in greenfield announcements, e-commerce players, traditional retailers and many consumer packaged goods companies continue to invest in modernizing their warehouses. Turning to our hybrid industries. Sales in this segment increased 35% year-over-year, led by strong growth in food and beverage. Food and beverage sales were up almost 40% versus prior year. We also saw a number of large orders this quarter with customers in this vertical continuing to invest in making their brownfield facilities more efficient and resilient. Demand in our dairy and agriculture processing business remains especially strong. Life sciences sales grew 20% year-over-year. One of the important wins this quarter was with a leading European health care company, where our Kalypso digital services used our Emulate3D simulation software to model and test multiple plant layouts to eliminate potential bottlenecks and increase worker safety. Tire was up over 50% in the quarter. Moving to process. This segment was up over 25% versus prior year, once again led by growth in oil and gas and metals. Within process, we had an important sustainability win. Through Occidental Petroleum's 1.5 subsidiary, Rockwell is providing control systems for direct air capture units that help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are proud to be a part of Occi\u2019s low-carbon strategy to deliver large-scale carbon management solutions that accelerate net zero economy. Turning now to Slide 5 and our Q2 organic regional sales. Similar to prior quarters, our growth by region reflects the electronic component availability and what's in our backlog rather than the underlying customer demand. North America organic sales grew 23% year-over-year. Latin America increased 16%, and EMEA sales grew 42% and Asia-Pacific was up 32%. Let's now move to Slide 6, fiscal 2023 outlook. We have previously said that the fiscal '23 sales performance is primarily based on our ability to ship backlog. Given our performance in the first half, improving ship supply and the benefits of our resiliency actions, we are increasing our sales and earnings outlook for fiscal '23. Our fiscal '23 guidance projects total reported sales growth of 14.5%. We expect organic sales growth of 15% at the midpoint. We expect acquisitions to contribute over 1 point of growth and currency to be a headwind of 1.5 points. Nick will touch more on this later. Organic ARR is expected to grow 15%. Segment margin is expected to increase by over 150 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow 25% versus prior year, and we continue to target 95% free cash flow conversion. Before I turn it over to Nick, let me share some of our thoughts on the setup for fiscal year '24. With more than half of this fiscal year behind us and through our continued discussions with end customers, we believe we have better visibility into our full year orders and backlog levels. We expect our fiscal '23 orders to be about $9 billion, which implies a slight moderation of orders in the second half of this year. This is consistent with our expectations of improving component availability and the subsequent reduction in customer lead times. With our current orders outlook, we anticipate exiting the year with backlog levels of around $5 billion, positioning us well for fiscal year '24. Also, as the largest pure play, we have an impressive record of earnings growth, and we expect that to continue given our unique market focus and differentiation. Let me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q2 performance and financial outlook for fiscal '23. Nick?\nNick Gangestad: Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8, second quarter key financial information. Second quarter reported sales were up 25.8% over last year. Q2 organic sales were up 27.3%, and acquisitions contributed 130 basis points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by 2.8% about 6 points of our organic growth came from price. Segment operating margin expanded to 21.3% and was higher than our expectations. The majority of this outperformance was driven by the higher revenue. The 560 basis point year-over-year increase in margin was driven by higher sales volume and positive price costs, partially offset by higher incentive compensation and higher investment spend. Corporate and other expense was $29 million, in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $3.01 was ahead of our expectations and grew 81% versus prior year. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter was 17.4%. Free cash flow of $156 million was $110 million higher compared to last year, driven by higher pretax income, partially offset by higher working capital. The increase in working capital was primarily driven by higher accounts receivable given our Q2 sales outperformance. We improved our days on hand in inventory by 7 days in Q2, and we expect reductions in inventory days to continue for the balance of the year. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased approximately 140,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $38 million. On March 31, $1.1 billion remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our 3 operating segments.  Organic sales grew double digits year-over-year in each of our operating segments. Turning to margins. Intelligent Devices margin increased by 560 basis points year-over-year due to positive price cost and higher sales volume, partially offset by higher investment spend and incentive compensation. Segment margin for software and control increased 900 basis points compared to last year on higher sales volume and positive price costs partially offset by higher investment spend and incentive compensation. Lifecycle services margin decreased by 180 basis points year-over-year as the benefit of higher sales was more than offset by higher incentive compensation and onetime items to expand future profitability. We expect lifecycle services margin to expand sequentially and exceed 10% in Q4. The next Slide, 10, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q2 fiscal '22 to Q2 fiscal '23. Core performance was up $1.95 on a 27.3% organic sales increase. The impact of currency was a $0.15 reduction in EPS. The year-over-year headwind reflects a stronger dollar versus Q2 of last year. Incentive compensation was a $0.40 headwind. This year-over-year increase reflects our lower bonus in Q2 of last year and our higher growth and earnings expectations for this fiscal year. Higher interest expense was a $0.05 impact. Our adjusted -- our higher adjusted effective tax rate was a $0.05 headwind and our reduction in outstanding shares added about $0.05. Let's move on to Slide 11, guidance for fiscal '23. We are increasing our reported sales guidance to approximately $8.9 billion in fiscal '23 or 14.5% growth at the midpoint. We expect organic sales growth to be in a range of 13% to 17% or 15% at the midpoint. We expect volume to add 10 points of growth and price to add 5 points of growth. This guidance takes into account our performance through the first half of the fiscal year and is based on our current view of ongoing supply chain improvement. In terms of the second half, we expect mid-teens organic growth in Q3 and high single-digit growth in Q4. This calendarization includes our view of chip availability in each of the next 2 quarters and our Q3 transition from one third-party logistics provider to another at 1 of our distribution centers. We now expect a full year currency headwind of 150 basis points, which is 50 basis points better than our previous guidance. This updated outlook primarily reflects the strengthening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar. We expect full year segment operating margin to be about 21.5%, up from our prior guidance of about 21%, driven by higher volume and higher benefit from price costs for the full year. We now expect an over 200 basis point improvement to margin year-over-year from positive price cost. This represents a 100 basis point increase versus our prior guidance, split evenly between price and cost. Our updated guidance now assumes full year core earnings conversion of close to 40%. We now expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17.5%, down from our prior forecast of 18% due to discrete items that were realized in Q2. We are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to $11.50 to $12.20. At the midpoint of the range, this represents 25% adjusted EPS growth, up from prior guidance of approximately 17% growth at the midpoint. We expect full year fiscal '23 free cash flow conversion of about 95% of adjusted income. A few additional comments on fiscal '23 guidance. Corporate and other expense is still expected to be around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal '23 is still expected to be around $130 million. And we're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.6 million shares. Turning to Slide 12. Versus our prior guidance, we are increasing the midpoint for EPS by $0.75. Our guidance reflects an increase in our core of $1.05 driven by higher organic sales and our improved outlook in price/cost. We also deployed additional investments in sales and new product development as well as digital infrastructure that will generate future revenue growth and profitability. Currency is adding $0.05. Given the stronger outlook, our incentive compensation is increased by $0.40. And finally, our 50 basis point drop in our adjusted effective tax rate will add $0.05. With that, I will turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A.  Blake?\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Nick. We are still operating in a dynamic environment and are laser-focused on execution through the rest of this fiscal year. With that said, we are continuing to accelerate new product development and investments in cloud-native technologies. Revenue from our new offerings, both organic and inorganic is becoming a more meaningful contributor to growth and share gains. We are the largest pure-play automation company with market-leading solutions across discrete, hybrid and process industries and we are adding scale to our differentiated offerings through strong partnerships and strategic acquisitions. Our recent acquisition of Knowledge Lens is adding 600 resources with cutting-edge data science, AI and cloud solutions to our existing digital services business. This expanded team is already working with our key customers on their next-generation plans. I want to welcome all Knowledge Lens employees to Rockwell. Our close relationships with end customers, our best-in-class ecosystem and our talent give us confidence in the continued momentum for growth and profitability this year and beyond.  Aijana will now begin the Q&A session.\nAijana Zellner: Thanks, Blake. We would like to get as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to 1 question and a quick follow-up. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Blake, so just focusing on your comments in terms of the setup for '24. I know there will be some investors who will think about the $9 billion of orders and say, look [Indiscernible] point to order deceleration in the second half. But how do you think about the cycle in the context of your $9 billion-plus solution, as we call it, that you're coming close to hitting this year and the $5 billion of backlog you end the year with. I know you suggested you're set up '24 earnings growth, but can you talk about how you're thinking about the durability of the automation cycle based on the conversations you're having? And do you have the capacity to grow beyond that $9 billion?\nBlake Moret: Sure. Well, let me take that first, Andy. We're continuing to add capacity. So at the same time that chip supply is improving. We're continuing to make sure that our labor and our facilities, our redundancy across our integrated supply chain operations is ready to handle continued growth. So let me start there. Now in terms of the demand, this is playing out like we thought it would. We have said for some time now that we did expect orders and shipments to converge as lead times improve. And so that's exactly what you're seeing, but the orders are continuing at a strong pace. And to look at that, let's take kind of a vertical by vertical view, we've talked about the historic generational spending levels in certain of the verticals that are important to us, things like electric vehicle and battery and semiconductor. We're seeing additional expenditures in energy, both as the fossil fuel providers decarbonized and as renewables become a bigger part of our business as well. But we're also seeing across all verticals an increased focus on automation, and that's due to large durable trends, things like scarcity of trained workforce and so the need to complement people with the technologies and the software and the services that we provide. So as I look across that while we continue to pay close attention to macroeconomic conditions, we think the setup for multiyear growth in automation and information is there.\nAndy Kaplowitz: And then maybe Blake or Nick, can you give us a little more color on your margins in the segments. If I look at software and control, it seems like when supply chain headwinds are not impacting that business, you can do sort of low to mid-30s and lifecycle, obviously, still kind of lagging behind a little bit. So do you get lifecycle up now starting in the second half of the year? And is that a fair assessment of software and control when it's sort of firing on all cylinders, it's an above 30% margin business.\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Andy, let me take that. As far as software and control with what we're seeing in that business and the mix of what we're selling and the strength in the overall market there, we do see over 30% as a sustainable margin for that business. In terms of lifecycle services, we see that -- that's going to be sequentially going up. And we had talked earlier about getting this to double digits. We see that happening in the fourth quarter. And we think that's a good trajectory we're going to expect to see happen beyond '23 as well. So that's where we're seeing margins in those two segments.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: So Blake, just on some of the order commentary, I want to square the circle here a little bit. Talking about, I guess, you kind of comp the comp sequentially. You had the pull forward that probably happened around the price increase. As you said, lead times are coming down a little bit. So presumably, customers sort of altering plans accordingly, but you still have, call it, flattish sequential order. So something seem to have gotten better. It seems like it's the same markets that get mentioned over and over again, like EV and battery and Life Sciences and a few others that come in there. But did anything, I guess, build momentum quarter-over-quarter and anything in terms of March or April exit rates that we should be aware of?\nBlake Moret: Yes, a couple of things. Josh, it was fairly broad, but in addition to the usual suspects, the things that we've been talking about for a while now, I'd say oil and gas orders were quite good. We had some major competitive wins in our Sensia business that built some great backlog there. And I would also say within the orders -- North American orders were relatively stronger than Europe and Asia, and we expect that to continue for the rest of the year.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: And then I guess there's the obligatory question for Nick on investment spending since I think that gets pulled around a little bit, especially when things are a little better than expected. Nick, was there any kind of reallocation of investment spending to get more in this quarter? And how should we think about the rest of the year?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. The investment spend for this particular for second quarter, it came up a few million dollars more than what we had in our initial plan for Q2. We are upping our investment spend in the third and fourth quarter. We started the year with, what I would call, a pretty conservative view of what we were going to do on spend, and we were holding some things in our back pocket that if things improve, we would be ready to invest in, and we are releasing that in the second half of the year. All in, that we see total investment spend up for the full year versus what we had previously estimated up by roughly $50 million. It's up year over year $180 million. I previously in the last guidance said it would be up $130 million, it's now up $180 million.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrew Obin: Just we are getting questions on lead times. So how should I think about this $5 billion number? Is that just a nice round comp to where you were versus fiscal -- the end of fiscal '22 where you sort of showed you were slightly above $5 billion, right, and then sort of $9 billion matches, $9 billion is just very simple math. Or is there a sort of dynamic update to this number throughout the year? Is it just basically a placeholder to help us think about the big framework? Or is that a number sort of somebody manages to an update inside the company every quarter?\nBlake Moret: Yes, Andrew, you should think about that as a slight reduction of the current backlog, which sits at about $5.6 billion, but still held up by continuing strong order rates. So it's not intended to be precise, but on the other hand, it does reflect the trends that we're seeing and that is that as lead times improve, we're able to clear past due backlog, but the overall number stays quite high due to the continuing strength of orders.\nAndrew Obin: And just a question on Plex because you guys had a great demo at Hanover show. Can you just a, 15% IRR is pretty impressive. But can we just talk about Plex is doing? And how does Rockwell sort of manage historical focus on large enterprise and try to sort of feel is the product and SMB end market, just evolution of Plex what the experience has been, as I said, because clearly, a big focus at Hanover show.\nBlake Moret: Sure. Well, Plex continues to be a really exciting addition to our offering, and it's playing out like we hoped it would when we made that acquisition. Plex is smart manufacturing platform to be sure, has MES capability, but it also has quality management, supply chain and even ERP functionality for small- and medium-sized businesses. When we bought Plex, they had a great track record in certain verticals like tier automotives, but we knew that with our existing market access, we could expand that into food and beverage and EV and mining. And we also knew that we had the opportunity to geographically diversify their customer base and we're doing just that with wins in Asia and with putting Plex on to Azure in Europe where we've already seen some nice wins there. So it's that synergy that's playing out, and there is lots of room to run with that. So it's working well. I've mentioned before, one of the things that we've done is to take the seasoned veterans of selling cloud-native SaaS software and given them enterprise-wide roles within Rockwell. So software sales leadership, our Chief Marketing Officer and a number of other functions are coming from Plex. So it's not just the technology and the business -- it's also the expertise that we're making sure that we don't vary in the organization.\nAndrew Obin: And growth rates sort of commensurate was 15%. Is it in line with 5% for the rest of the business, better worse, if you could just sort of benchmark that if you're [Indiscernible].\nBlake Moret: Sure. Plex and Flix are very supportive to the overall growth of our software business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Maybe just wanted to try and drill into that book-to-bill element a little bit more for the back half being well below one. It doesn't sound like you're perturbed by that. but just trying to understand, if we look at it in a little bit more detail, anything you'd call out around sort of hybrid versus process versus discrete markets, maybe where you see that book-to-bill or year-on-year orders pressure being most severe. And just maybe a question sort of more broadly on that for Blake. You've had this component flush driving this huge revenue surge right now. Is there sort of a view on the world or the demand environment post that flush changed at all in recent months?\nBlake Moret: Yes. So Julian, let me start. I wouldn't characterize the reduction in backlog is pressured. It's playing out in a way that we would hope it is in that we're clearing past due backlog and improving customer service levels and adding additional orders in the business. So you know historically that Rockwell has been fortunate to be able to ship out products pretty much in the same quarter that we get the order. So this is unusual to have product backlog, and we intend to continue to reduce the lead times and products just as much as possible. At the same time, a 1.27 book-to-bill in our Lifecycle Services business gives us good confidence about continuing demand for longer cycle projects there. So I feel good about the way that this is working. We obviously are focused on execution as well as creating additional demand going forward, but we feel this is a very healthy environment. To your second question about, has anything changed in terms of the component world, being able to get chips. I mean we're always going to have a larger effort than we did pre supply chain constraints on making sure that our designs are resilient, both in terms of reevaluating existing products as well as new products and to make sure that they will go forward unless we have new levels of resiliency in component supply and robust designs to be able to reduce dependencies on any one vendor. So that's here to stay. We do believe, as Nick talked about, working capital with some of the inventory increases to go down, and that supports the good cash flow for the year. So certain of those things aren't going to change all the way back to, let's say, prepandemic, but we do expect a return to more normal levels in working capital and so on as we go forward as the chip constraints continue to resolve themselves.\nJulian Mitchell: And when you sort of look at the two components of customer demand being strong and a good pipeline of projects coming up, plus at the same time, a sort of accelerated backlog conversion into revenue because of supply chain, do you think we could be in for quite a prolonged period of having that book-to-bill below one? Or you're sort of thinking, no, we get some adjustments for a couple of quarters and then it moves back into seeing sort of one-to-one like Rockwell's classic business model.\nBlake Moret: Yes. Beyond kind of unusual levels of disclosure about the setup for '24 we've already given. I'm not going to guess further about that, but we do believe that the demand for automation in the specific verticals that I've talked about and as well as a general setup is something that's a positive read going forward. And our intention is to reduce product level lead times closer and closer to what they were before these constraints, but with an incoming order rate far above what they were prepandemic.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSteve Tusa: Congrats on the execution on this backlog. I missed a part of the call. But did you guys talk about the sequential change in that -- in the backlog from 4Q -- or sorry, 1Q to 2Q?\nNick Gangestad: Steve, what we talked about is that the backlog at the middle of the year for us now stands at $5.6 billion. That's versus $5.2 million that it was at the beginning of the year. So up $400 million for the first 6 months of the year.\nSteve Tusa: And then just on the margins at F&C, how much of that is like did you break down at all how much of that was the products-related price/cost spread? Maybe just a little bit more color on the year-over-year margin drivers? How much came from the products in that business and how much came from the software there?\nNick Gangestad: I haven't provided the product versus the software mix. But in terms of the things that are causing the margin expansion. The biggest factor by far is the volume growth that we're experiencing and the leverage we're getting on that. The second biggest thing that is improving that margin is the favorable price/cost versus where we were in second quarter last year. And then offsetting that, to some extent, to bring it down to a 900 basis point year-on-year increase. We have increased investment spend year-over-year in software and control, and we also are facing noticeably higher incentive compensation. Those are the 2 negative things on the margin in the year-over-year Q2 for Software and Control.\nSteve Tusa: And then where do you expect that margin to end? Where do you expect that margin to finish the year just for the annual F&C margin?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. We think it will be over 30%. It's -- and that's up from what I have said in the past that we see that margin being able to sustain into the second half of the year. At levels fairly similar to what we're seeing in our second quarter. So full year, we're going to be above 30% could be a few percentage points above 30%.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nNigel Coe: So I see some of the call, so I apologize if we're going to be sort of like, I will be asking the question we've asked about 3 times. But just wondering about the backlog kind of conversion means supply chains, where are we versus normal in terms of lead times? And converting this backlog, is it more constraint of just the lead times? Is it labor? Is it customer acceptance, project timing? What could cause the backlog to convert even faster in the second half of the year?\nBlake Moret: Yes. Nigel, this is a good development in that as the chip supply is easing that's really the primary limiting factor as we're clearing older backlog there. As we've said, we've got about $5.6 billion worth of backlog, and we're expecting that to go down to around $5 billion by the end of the year, but it's held up by continuing good order intake there. And also the contribution from lifecycle services with its strong book-to-bill. So it's primarily the chip supply. We feel good about our ability to continue to add labor in our facilities around the world. We've been adding for some time now, additional equipment. But as you know, we're not really a very capital-intensive operation. So it's not like if we're having to add a lot of heavy equipment because we're primarily an intellectual capital company. And so the equipment that we need has relatively shorter lead times than if we were in heavier manufacturing type operations.\nNigel Coe: And then just another stab at the backlog. Are we seeing the mix of the backlog shifting to some of the larger projects, particularly with the systems, ED plants, et cetera. I mean, so are we seeing some of those larger systems orders coming through in the backlog? And then just kind of another part of that would be you point to $9 billion of orders, so obviously $4.8 billion in the first half, $4.2 billion the first half, $4.2 billion in the second half. What's -- I mean, 4.2% is still a very level, no question about it, but -- what's causing that drop down? Is it project timing? Is it lead times for customers channels are just not placing kind of the same rate of orders. What kind of visibility do you have to that second half deceleration in orders? Again, very healthy level that you are pointing to declining orders.\nBlake Moret: Yes. So first of all, in terms of the composition of the backlog, I don't think we're seeing any fundamental change in the type of orders. Now obviously, as we move through the backlog has a richer pricing as we work through the year. So that's a good read. But in terms of the number of big EV projects or semiconductor, facilities management systems or independent card or just continuing MRO, I don't think you're going to see a big change because a lot of these investment cycles in those areas are multiyear. We're in it for the long haul with some of these positive areas. Now in terms of where you might see a little bit of the contribution from the moderation in orders, probably the most specific area is as lead times improve, as they are across a lot of our product lines, you'll see machine builders not having to provide orders of the same size to have as many months of coverage of their backlog. So as they're concerned about their cash flow and they can look at shorter lead times, then they can reduce the size of their orders because they don't need as many months coverage for the machines that they've already booked. So I think that's probably the most specific contribution to some of the orders moderation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Mason from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRob Mason: I called out Sensia several times in and around oil and gas. So it sounds like things are positioned to accelerate further there. But any thoughts just on -- it still looks like maybe we're pulling through an operating loss just based on the minority interest, how profitability might shift as we go forward over the next 6, 12 months at Sensia.\nBlake Moret: Yes. You said it. I mean, we're seeing some good growth there. We had a particularly strong orders, and there's a very strong backlog in the business. And so as we move through the coming quarters, we expect the positive contribution of Sensia both in terms of growth and profitability to have an impact first on lifecycle services and then more broadly across Rockwell.\nNick Gangestad: And Rob, just to build on that. In my prepared remarks, I talked about some onetime costs that we took in the second quarter to expand profitability. Some of that is focused in the Sensia area where we made some investments to simplify business infrastructure for Sensia that we think will make it even more -- build it for more profitability in the future. And so that's part of what we're seeing in our second quarter results for Sensia.\nRob Mason: Excellent. Just as a follow-up to, any thoughts, I didn't hear any commentary specific to China, just exactly what you're seeing on the ground in China and how that recovery is playing out in your business?\nBlake Moret: Yes. So a couple of things. First of all, in general, the growth is strong in China across the business. And it's a lot of the same contributors that we've seen in the past with areas like EV and life sciences and so on. So we think that our business there is posed for continued growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Andre on for Noah. On the M&A pipeline, you've previously defined ISGS and market access in Europe and Asia and Advanced Material Handling as priorities. Could you give us any color on what's most near term for you as a focus and how active that pipeline looks today?\nBlake Moret: Yes. Andre, it's a good pipeline, and you said it. Those are the priorities. That's fairly broad. But within that, there's a lot of information management software in the production world. So there's some decent targets there. Cybersecurity has been extremely successful for us both organically and as we've added additional capabilities through some acquisitions, advanced material handling. We talk all the time about our independent cart technology, about some of the things we're doing in robotics applications as the lines get blurred between robot control and programmable line control, and we think there's some very interesting things going on there. Obviously, you had AI and autonomy to some of these areas, and there's new dimensions for value for customers. And then New York and Asia, we're very happy, for instance, with what we're doing in -- with awesome, the Italian manufacturer of industrial PCs that also has some great software that's forming the basis for some of our most exciting new introduction. So I would say that the pipeline is good across all of those fronts.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you also just get an update on pipeline and customer needs in the EV transition starting with the upstream opportunity in lithium and any impact of the IRA and domestic battery and vehicle production where customers in that vertical focused most right now?\nBlake Moret: Well, they're all focused on building up their fleet capacity so that they can get a return on these giant investments. You don't get that unless you put more jobs per hour on the door and so they're all working to be able to expand their production output. But if you look on the on the road today, you still don't see a ton of electric vehicles and all of them, if you listen to those goals and you look at the trends, this is a multiyear process and from start to finish lines and the basic materials that are needed for the batteries, through the battery making facilities through the electric vehicle assembly. All of that has to build out to be able to get us to a point where you start seeing electric vehicles come anywhere near approaching internal combustion vehicles on the road. So this is multiple years and all of these manufacturers are focused on debottlenecking that whole supply chain, which is going to be in the news for years to come. I think the one other question. I mean the IRA, obviously, that helps there as well as it does with other renewable providers. We've talked before about First Solar, for instance. We talked about Oxy's 1.5 initiative. So we're seeing more and more of these come online across our verticals and people are doing it because it's important for their business models. And again, that's not a femoral thing. That's going to be over multiple years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Phil Buller from Berenberg. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPhil Buller: I was hoping you could expand on the topic of, I guess, the order funnel or pipeline rather than the backlog. I'm wondering if you're more excited about the funnel in process markets, generally speaking, more so than discrete or hybrid at this point. You've thought very helpfully about different customer examples in those like EVs and such. I'm just trying to get a handle on how it aggregates into those big process versus discrete buckets. So which funnel is getting fuller, if you will? And perhaps you can remind us if there's any structural margin differential between those that would be great.\nBlake Moret: Sure. Yes, it's broad-based. I mean, we're very happy with the way that our business is balanced between discrete and hybrid and process applications with big opportunities in all of them. I mean, as we talk about EV and battery in discrete, we talk about food and beverage and life sciences, food and beverage is our single biggest vertical in hybrid. And then in process, I highlighted some particularly strong order activity with Sensia, but we also continue to see good activity in metals as well. So it's across all of them. Now in terms of the margin, one to the next there's high-margin opportunities in each one. I would say that the engineered systems are concentrated a little bit more heavily on the process side. Those customers are more often looking for engineering content to complement the hardware coming from the same provider. So you'd probably see a little bit lower margin there due to the people intensivity of that, but good opportunities in the funnel for near and midterm orders across all of the industry segments.\nPhil Buller: And just in terms of the different topic margins here. I know you've touched on the Software and Control margin. The drop through between the three different businesses is quite different, depending on which one you're looking at. And I know that there's been a lot of things bouncing around at the moment. So I guess I was just trying to get a handle on how you think about the H2 margin evolution for each of the three businesses relative to H1. Is there anything that you could point out that we should be bearing in mind beyond Software and Control, please?\nNick Gangestad: Beyond Software and Control, which I've already covered still, when I look at intelligent devices, that's been a little over 20%, about 21% margin in the first half of this year. I think for the full year, it's going to be close to that, maybe between 20% and 21% for the full year margin for Intelligent Devices. Some of the things happening there, we continue to see good volume, good price growth, but as I talked about earlier, for the full year, we'll also be seeing higher incentive comp and higher investment spend. This is one of the places where we've been focusing some of our investment spend in resiliency and we'll see that continuing. So between 20% and 21% for Intelligent Devices. And then soft -- excuse me, lifecycle services. I've talked about sequential improvement. I don't see us crossing the threshold into double-digit margin until the fourth quarter. So I see Q3 being a move in that direction from where we were in the first half where we're in the little over 5% margin. We'll be stepping it up, but not all the way to 10% and then going to 10% or over in the fourth quarter.\nAijana Zellner: Julian, we will take one more question.\nOperator: Certainly, our last question will come from Jairam Nathan from Daiwa. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJairam Nathan: So I just wanted to spend a little time on the automotive. We are seeing, as the transition towards EVs, we are seeing the number of process steps coming down. And I understand Rockwell probably does not have a lot of content on welding, but do you see any implications as EVs or auto companies go from spot welding to giga casting and things like that?\nBlake Moret: Yes. So the net opportunity for Rockwell actually goes up as we go from internal combustion engines to EVs, and that's for a couple of reasons. First of all, the traditional drivetrain operations. That's a more subtractive manufacturing process, that's boring cylinders, that's finishing metal surfaces and things like that. And that's largely done with computer numerical control, which is not a technology that Rockwell directly has. We have good partnerships, but it's not something that we provide directly. And so when that's replaced by some of the operations in electric vehicles, most notably, the battery formation and packing and assembly. That's more of an assembly type operation. And there's aspects at the front end of that with batch processes. And those are all applications that Rockwell has great readiness to serve. Then when you look at what you specifically mentioned in the joining part of it, it's more complex press operations, and Rockwell has great press control systems. So as the metal formation becomes more complex, again, those are really good applications for Rockwell with our program of control as well as our expanded drive control. So we feel good about those opportunities. And then added to those basic automation applications. It's the software that's a more pervasive part of the electric vehicle and battery manufacturing process, and we have really good solutions there.\nJairam Nathan: And one more, if I may. So I mean all the -- given your outlook, I think the 1 area which actually decline seems to be chemicals. I think you went from a high single digit from a low double -- double digits. So can you explain that a bit?\nBlake Moret: No. I don't have a specific answer for where chemical is moderating other than to say our focus in chemical is more on the specialty chemical, fine chemical as opposed to bulk chemicals.\nOperator: We have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Zellner for closing remarks.\nAijana Zellner: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. That concludes today's call.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. At this time, you may disconnect. Thank you.",

            "name": "Nick Gangestad",
            "content": "Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8, second quarter key financial information. Second quarter reported sales were up 25.8% over last year. Q2 organic sales were up 27.3%, and acquisitions contributed 130 basis points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by 2.8% about 6 points of our organic growth came from price. Segment operating margin expanded to 21.3% and was higher than our expectations. The majority of this outperformance was driven by the higher revenue. The 560 basis point year-over-year increase in margin was driven by higher sales volume and positive price costs, partially offset by higher incentive compensation and higher investment spend. Corporate and other expense was $29 million, in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $3.01 was ahead of our expectations and grew 81% versus prior year. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter was 17.4%. Free cash flow of $156 million was $110 million higher compared to last year, driven by higher pretax income, partially offset by higher working capital. The increase in working capital was primarily driven by higher accounts receivable given our Q2 sales outperformance. We improved our days on hand in inventory by 7 days in Q2, and we expect reductions in inventory days to continue for the balance of the year. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased approximately 140,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $38 million. On March 31, $1.1 billion remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our 3 operating segments.  Organic sales grew double digits year-over-year in each of our operating segments. Turning to margins. Intelligent Devices margin increased by 560 basis points year-over-year due to positive price cost and higher sales volume, partially offset by higher investment spend and incentive compensation. Segment margin for software and control increased 900 basis points compared to last year on higher sales volume and positive price costs partially offset by higher investment spend and incentive compensation. Lifecycle services margin decreased by 180 basis points year-over-year as the benefit of higher sales was more than offset by higher incentive compensation and onetime items to expand future profitability. We expect lifecycle services margin to expand sequentially and exceed 10% in Q4. The next Slide, 10, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q2 fiscal '22 to Q2 fiscal '23. Core performance was up $1.95 on a 27.3% organic sales increase. The impact of currency was a $0.15 reduction in EPS. The year-over-year headwind reflects a stronger dollar versus Q2 of last year. Incentive compensation was a $0.40 headwind. This year-over-year increase reflects our lower bonus in Q2 of last year and our higher growth and earnings expectations for this fiscal year. Higher interest expense was a $0.05 impact. Our adjusted -- our higher adjusted effective tax rate was a $0.05 headwind and our reduction in outstanding shares added about $0.05. Let's move on to Slide 11, guidance for fiscal '23. We are increasing our reported sales guidance to approximately $8.9 billion in fiscal '23 or 14.5% growth at the midpoint. We expect organic sales growth to be in a range of 13% to 17% or 15% at the midpoint. We expect volume to add 10 points of growth and price to add 5 points of growth. This guidance takes into account our performance through the first half of the fiscal year and is based on our current view of ongoing supply chain improvement. In terms of the second half, we expect mid-teens organic growth in Q3 and high single-digit growth in Q4. This calendarization includes our view of chip availability in each of the next 2 quarters and our Q3 transition from one third-party logistics provider to another at 1 of our distribution centers. We now expect a full year currency headwind of 150 basis points, which is 50 basis points better than our previous guidance. This updated outlook primarily reflects the strengthening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar. We expect full year segment operating margin to be about 21.5%, up from our prior guidance of about 21%, driven by higher volume and higher benefit from price costs for the full year. We now expect an over 200 basis point improvement to margin year-over-year from positive price cost. This represents a 100 basis point increase versus our prior guidance, split evenly between price and cost. Our updated guidance now assumes full year core earnings conversion of close to 40%. We now expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17.5%, down from our prior forecast of 18% due to discrete items that were realized in Q2. We are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to $11.50 to $12.20. At the midpoint of the range, this represents 25% adjusted EPS growth, up from prior guidance of approximately 17% growth at the midpoint. We expect full year fiscal '23 free cash flow conversion of about 95% of adjusted income. A few additional comments on fiscal '23 guidance. Corporate and other expense is still expected to be around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal '23 is still expected to be around $130 million. And we're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.6 million shares. Turning to Slide 12. Versus our prior guidance, we are increasing the midpoint for EPS by $0.75. Our guidance reflects an increase in our core of $1.05 driven by higher organic sales and our improved outlook in price/cost. We also deployed additional investments in sales and new product development as well as digital infrastructure that will generate future revenue growth and profitability. Currency is adding $0.05. Given the stronger outlook, our incentive compensation is increased by $0.40. And finally, our 50 basis point drop in our adjusted effective tax rate will add $0.05. With that, I will turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A.  Blake? Yes, Andy, let me take that. As far as software and control with what we're seeing in that business and the mix of what we're selling and the strength in the overall market there, we do see over 30% as a sustainable margin for that business. In terms of lifecycle services, we see that -- that's going to be sequentially going up. And we had talked earlier about getting this to double digits. We see that happening in the fourth quarter. And we think that's a good trajectory we're going to expect to see happen beyond '23 as well. So that's where we're seeing margins in those two segments. Yes. The investment spend for this particular for second quarter, it came up a few million dollars more than what we had in our initial plan for Q2. We are upping our investment spend in the third and fourth quarter. We started the year with, what I would call, a pretty conservative view of what we were going to do on spend, and we were holding some things in our back pocket that if things improve, we would be ready to invest in, and we are releasing that in the second half of the year. All in, that we see total investment spend up for the full year versus what we had previously estimated up by roughly $50 million. It's up year over year $180 million. I previously in the last guidance said it would be up $130 million, it's now up $180 million. Steve, what we talked about is that the backlog at the middle of the year for us now stands at $5.6 billion. That's versus $5.2 million that it was at the beginning of the year. So up $400 million for the first 6 months of the year. I haven't provided the product versus the software mix. But in terms of the things that are causing the margin expansion. The biggest factor by far is the volume growth that we're experiencing and the leverage we're getting on that. The second biggest thing that is improving that margin is the favorable price/cost versus where we were in second quarter last year. And then offsetting that, to some extent, to bring it down to a 900 basis point year-on-year increase. We have increased investment spend year-over-year in software and control, and we also are facing noticeably higher incentive compensation. Those are the 2 negative things on the margin in the year-over-year Q2 for Software and Control. Yes. We think it will be over 30%. It's -- and that's up from what I have said in the past that we see that margin being able to sustain into the second half of the year. At levels fairly similar to what we're seeing in our second quarter. So full year, we're going to be above 30% could be a few percentage points above 30%. And Rob, just to build on that. In my prepared remarks, I talked about some onetime costs that we took in the second quarter to expand profitability. Some of that is focused in the Sensia area where we made some investments to simplify business infrastructure for Sensia that we think will make it even more -- build it for more profitability in the future. And so that's part of what we're seeing in our second quarter results for Sensia. Beyond Software and Control, which I've already covered still, when I look at intelligent devices, that's been a little over 20%, about 21% margin in the first half of this year. I think for the full year, it's going to be close to that, maybe between 20% and 21% for the full year margin for Intelligent Devices. Some of the things happening there, we continue to see good volume, good price growth, but as I talked about earlier, for the full year, we'll also be seeing higher incentive comp and higher investment spend. This is one of the places where we've been focusing some of our investment spend in resiliency and we'll see that continuing. So between 20% and 21% for Intelligent Devices. And then soft -- excuse me, lifecycle services. I've talked about sequential improvement. I don't see us crossing the threshold into double-digit margin until the fourth quarter. So I see Q3 being a move in that direction from where we were in the first half where we're in the little over 5% margin. We'll be stepping it up, but not all the way to 10% and then going to 10% or over in the fourth quarter."

            "name": "Blake Moret",
            "content": "Thanks Aijana. And good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our second quarter results on Slide 3. We had an outstanding quarter of strong growth in both sales and earnings. Our double-digit sales and margin growth continue to reflect Rockwell's strong execution and focus on business resiliency as well as overall improvement in electronic component availability. The demand for our differentiated offerings continue to be strong even in this uncertain economic environment. Through the first half of this fiscal year, our total orders were $4.8 billion, spread evenly between the 2 quarters once we adjust for the estimated price-related pull forward in our fiscal Q1. As expected, our order cancellation rates remain in the low single digits through April. Total sales grew over 25% versus prior year. Organic sales were up over 27% year-over-year and were above our expectations. Currency translation reduced sales by about 3% and acquisitions contributed over 1 point of growth this quarter. As in the prior quarters, the split of sales by business segment, region and industry, was largely driven by access to electronic components and the composition of our backlog. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales grew 27% versus prior year with broad-based growth across all businesses. We continue to see wider adoption of our independent cart technology in new applications across semiconductor, food and beverage and life sciences. One example of the new application is way for transport in semiconductor fabs. We continue to see increasing demand for this offering including important win with a large U.S company this quarter. These customer investing in modernizing and expanding its material handling systems and our independent cart technology helps increase wafer output and more efficiently utilizes existing fab space leading to increased capacity and significant savings. Software and Control organic sales increased over 40%. Strong growth versus prior year was led by logic, where we continue to see the benefits of our resiliency investments and an overall improvement in supply chain. Lifecycle Services organic sales were up 12% year-over-year. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.27, led by strong order intake in our Sensia business. Information Solutions and Connected Services sales grew about 10% versus prior year. We had another quarter of competitive multiyear wins across our software and cybersecurity services portfolio. Within Information Solutions, I am pleased with the increasing breadth of our new Plex customers as we continue to expand our SaaS, Smart Manufacturing platform to new industries and geographies. One of our Plex wins this quarter was with AB-InBev, the world's largest brewing company and its start-up business EverGrain, focused on upcycling grain by product into sustainable supply of nutritious food ingredients. Our modular and cloud-native Flix software is helping EverGrain quickly deploy mission-critical quality management capabilities today while providing the functionality for the business to scale in the future. In Connected Services, we saw another quarter of customer demand for our recurring cybersecurity and infrastructure as a service offerings as customers across many industries are continuing to invest in safety and security of their operations. One of these wins was with Darling Ingredients, a food processing company focused on reducing food waste by collecting and repurposing animal-based products. Our annual recurring revenue grew 15% year-over-year in Q2. Segment margin of 21.3% was up over 560 basis points year-over-year and was better than expected. Adjusted EPS grew over 81% year-over-year. We also completed the acquisition of Knowledge Lens this quarter, which adds significant scale to our Kalypso digital services business. Let's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q2 end market performance. Consistent with my earlier comments on the gradually improving supply chain environment, all 3 industry segments grew strong double digits versus prior year. Our discrete sales were up about 20% in the quarter. Within discrete, automotive sales grew over 40% versus prior year. We saw a number of strategic wins in EV and battery this quarter both in the U.S. and China, where a combination of our core automation and strong partner ecosystem helped edge out our biggest competitors. While some customers are optimizing operating costs in the near term, they still continue to invest in building out new capacity to meet their production goals. Semiconductor sales were up mid-teens year-over-year. I already mentioned one semiconductor win. Another example of how Rockwell is expanding our existing semi footprint now with wafer transport applications is our multiyear project win with analog devices. Our independent cart technology was chosen to automate ADI's material handling applications at several of their global fabs. By implementing our technology, ADI will improve operator productivity by at least 20% by moving away from manually delivering lots across the fab. In e-commerce and warehouse automation, our Q2 sales were down mid-single digits versus prior year. While we continue to see a pause in greenfield announcements, e-commerce players, traditional retailers and many consumer packaged goods companies continue to invest in modernizing their warehouses. Turning to our hybrid industries. Sales in this segment increased 35% year-over-year, led by strong growth in food and beverage. Food and beverage sales were up almost 40% versus prior year. We also saw a number of large orders this quarter with customers in this vertical continuing to invest in making their brownfield facilities more efficient and resilient. Demand in our dairy and agriculture processing business remains especially strong. Life sciences sales grew 20% year-over-year. One of the important wins this quarter was with a leading European health care company, where our Kalypso digital services used our Emulate3D simulation software to model and test multiple plant layouts to eliminate potential bottlenecks and increase worker safety. Tire was up over 50% in the quarter. Moving to process. This segment was up over 25% versus prior year, once again led by growth in oil and gas and metals. Within process, we had an important sustainability win. Through Occidental Petroleum's 1.5 subsidiary, Rockwell is providing control systems for direct air capture units that help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are proud to be a part of Occi's low-carbon strategy to deliver large-scale carbon management solutions that accelerate net zero economy. Turning now to Slide 5 and our Q2 organic regional sales. Similar to prior quarters, our growth by region reflects the electronic component availability and what's in our backlog rather than the underlying customer demand. North America organic sales grew 23% year-over-year. Latin America increased 16%, and EMEA sales grew 42% and Asia-Pacific was up 32%. Let's now move to Slide 6, fiscal 2023 outlook. We have previously said that the fiscal '23 sales performance is primarily based on our ability to ship backlog. Given our performance in the first half, improving ship supply and the benefits of our resiliency actions, we are increasing our sales and earnings outlook for fiscal '23. Our fiscal '23 guidance projects total reported sales growth of 14.5%. We expect organic sales growth of 15% at the midpoint. We expect acquisitions to contribute over 1 point of growth and currency to be a headwind of 1.5 points. Nick will touch more on this later. Organic ARR is expected to grow 15%. Segment margin is expected to increase by over 150 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow 25% versus prior year, and we continue to target 95% free cash flow conversion. Before I turn it over to Nick, let me share some of our thoughts on the setup for fiscal year '24. With more than half of this fiscal year behind us and through our continued discussions with end customers, we believe we have better visibility into our full year orders and backlog levels. We expect our fiscal '23 orders to be about $9 billion, which implies a slight moderation of orders in the second half of this year. This is consistent with our expectations of improving component availability and the subsequent reduction in customer lead times. With our current orders outlook, we anticipate exiting the year with backlog levels of around $5 billion, positioning us well for fiscal year '24. Also, as the largest pure play, we have an impressive record of earnings growth, and we expect that to continue given our unique market focus and differentiation. Let me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q2 performance and financial outlook for fiscal '23. Nick? Thanks, Nick. We are still operating in a dynamic environment and are laser-focused on execution through the rest of this fiscal year. With that said, we are continuing to accelerate new product development and investments in cloud-native technologies. Revenue from our new offerings, both organic and inorganic is becoming a more meaningful contributor to growth and share gains. We are the largest pure-play automation company with market-leading solutions across discrete, hybrid and process industries and we are adding scale to our differentiated offerings through strong partnerships and strategic acquisitions. Our recent acquisition of Knowledge Lens is adding 600 resources with cutting-edge data science, AI and cloud solutions to our existing digital services business. This expanded team is already working with our key customers on their next-generation plans. I want to welcome all Knowledge Lens employees to Rockwell. Our close relationships with end customers, our best-in-class ecosystem and our talent give us confidence in the continued momentum for growth and profitability this year and beyond.  Aijana will now begin the Q&A session. Sure. Well, let me take that first, Andy. We're continuing to add capacity. So at the same time that chip supply is improving. We're continuing to make sure that our labor and our facilities, our redundancy across our integrated supply chain operations is ready to handle continued growth. So let me start there. Now in terms of the demand, this is playing out like we thought it would. We have said for some time now that we did expect orders and shipments to converge as lead times improve. And so that's exactly what you're seeing, but the orders are continuing at a strong pace. And to look at that, let's take kind of a vertical by vertical view, we've talked about the historic generational spending levels in certain of the verticals that are important to us, things like electric vehicle and battery and semiconductor. We're seeing additional expenditures in energy, both as the fossil fuel providers decarbonized and as renewables become a bigger part of our business as well. But we're also seeing across all verticals an increased focus on automation, and that's due to large durable trends, things like scarcity of trained workforce and so the need to complement people with the technologies and the software and the services that we provide. So as I look across that while we continue to pay close attention to macroeconomic conditions, we think the setup for multiyear growth in automation and information is there. Yes, a couple of things. Josh, it was fairly broad, but in addition to the usual suspects, the things that we've been talking about for a while now, I'd say oil and gas orders were quite good. We had some major competitive wins in our Sensia business that built some great backlog there. And I would also say within the orders -- North American orders were relatively stronger than Europe and Asia, and we expect that to continue for the rest of the year. Yes, Andrew, you should think about that as a slight reduction of the current backlog, which sits at about $5.6 billion, but still held up by continuing strong order rates. So it's not intended to be precise, but on the other hand, it does reflect the trends that we're seeing and that is that as lead times improve, we're able to clear past due backlog, but the overall number stays quite high due to the continuing strength of orders. Sure. Well, Plex continues to be a really exciting addition to our offering, and it's playing out like we hoped it would when we made that acquisition. Plex is smart manufacturing platform to be sure, has MES capability, but it also has quality management, supply chain and even ERP functionality for small- and medium-sized businesses. When we bought Plex, they had a great track record in certain verticals like tier automotives, but we knew that with our existing market access, we could expand that into food and beverage and EV and mining. And we also knew that we had the opportunity to geographically diversify their customer base and we're doing just that with wins in Asia and with putting Plex on to Azure in Europe where we've already seen some nice wins there. So it's that synergy that's playing out, and there is lots of room to run with that. So it's working well. I've mentioned before, one of the things that we've done is to take the seasoned veterans of selling cloud-native SaaS software and given them enterprise-wide roles within Rockwell. So software sales leadership, our Chief Marketing Officer and a number of other functions are coming from Plex. So it's not just the technology and the business -- it's also the expertise that we're making sure that we don't vary in the organization. Sure. Plex and Flix are very supportive to the overall growth of our software business. Yes. So Julian, let me start. I wouldn't characterize the reduction in backlog is pressured. It's playing out in a way that we would hope it is in that we're clearing past due backlog and improving customer service levels and adding additional orders in the business. So you know historically that Rockwell has been fortunate to be able to ship out products pretty much in the same quarter that we get the order. So this is unusual to have product backlog, and we intend to continue to reduce the lead times and products just as much as possible. At the same time, a 1.27 book-to-bill in our Lifecycle Services business gives us good confidence about continuing demand for longer cycle projects there. So I feel good about the way that this is working. We obviously are focused on execution as well as creating additional demand going forward, but we feel this is a very healthy environment. To your second question about, has anything changed in terms of the component world, being able to get chips. I mean we're always going to have a larger effort than we did pre supply chain constraints on making sure that our designs are resilient, both in terms of reevaluating existing products as well as new products and to make sure that they will go forward unless we have new levels of resiliency in component supply and robust designs to be able to reduce dependencies on any one vendor. So that's here to stay. We do believe, as Nick talked about, working capital with some of the inventory increases to go down, and that supports the good cash flow for the year. So certain of those things aren't going to change all the way back to, let's say, prepandemic, but we do expect a return to more normal levels in working capital and so on as we go forward as the chip constraints continue to resolve themselves. Yes. Beyond kind of unusual levels of disclosure about the setup for '24 we've already given. I'm not going to guess further about that, but we do believe that the demand for automation in the specific verticals that I've talked about and as well as a general setup is something that's a positive read going forward. And our intention is to reduce product level lead times closer and closer to what they were before these constraints, but with an incoming order rate far above what they were prepandemic. Yes. Nigel, this is a good development in that as the chip supply is easing that's really the primary limiting factor as we're clearing older backlog there. As we've said, we've got about $5.6 billion worth of backlog, and we're expecting that to go down to around $5 billion by the end of the year, but it's held up by continuing good order intake there. And also the contribution from lifecycle services with its strong book-to-bill. So it's primarily the chip supply. We feel good about our ability to continue to add labor in our facilities around the world. We've been adding for some time now, additional equipment. But as you know, we're not really a very capital-intensive operation. So it's not like if we're having to add a lot of heavy equipment because we're primarily an intellectual capital company. And so the equipment that we need has relatively shorter lead times than if we were in heavier manufacturing type operations. Yes. So first of all, in terms of the composition of the backlog, I don't think we're seeing any fundamental change in the type of orders. Now obviously, as we move through the backlog has a richer pricing as we work through the year. So that's a good read. But in terms of the number of big EV projects or semiconductor, facilities management systems or independent card or just continuing MRO, I don't think you're going to see a big change because a lot of these investment cycles in those areas are multiyear. We're in it for the long haul with some of these positive areas. Now in terms of where you might see a little bit of the contribution from the moderation in orders, probably the most specific area is as lead times improve, as they are across a lot of our product lines, you'll see machine builders not having to provide orders of the same size to have as many months of coverage of their backlog. So as they're concerned about their cash flow and they can look at shorter lead times, then they can reduce the size of their orders because they don't need as many months coverage for the machines that they've already booked. So I think that's probably the most specific contribution to some of the orders moderation. Yes. You said it. I mean, we're seeing some good growth there. We had a particularly strong orders, and there's a very strong backlog in the business. And so as we move through the coming quarters, we expect the positive contribution of Sensia both in terms of growth and profitability to have an impact first on lifecycle services and then more broadly across Rockwell. Yes. So a couple of things. First of all, in general, the growth is strong in China across the business. And it's a lot of the same contributors that we've seen in the past with areas like EV and life sciences and so on. So we think that our business there is posed for continued growth. Yes. Andre, it's a good pipeline, and you said it. Those are the priorities. That's fairly broad. But within that, there's a lot of information management software in the production world. So there's some decent targets there. Cybersecurity has been extremely successful for us both organically and as we've added additional capabilities through some acquisitions, advanced material handling. We talk all the time about our independent cart technology, about some of the things we're doing in robotics applications as the lines get blurred between robot control and programmable line control, and we think there's some very interesting things going on there. Obviously, you had AI and autonomy to some of these areas, and there's new dimensions for value for customers. And then New York and Asia, we're very happy, for instance, with what we're doing in -- with awesome, the Italian manufacturer of industrial PCs that also has some great software that's forming the basis for some of our most exciting new introduction. So I would say that the pipeline is good across all of those fronts. Well, they're all focused on building up their fleet capacity so that they can get a return on these giant investments. You don't get that unless you put more jobs per hour on the door and so they're all working to be able to expand their production output. But if you look on the on the road today, you still don't see a ton of electric vehicles and all of them, if you listen to those goals and you look at the trends, this is a multiyear process and from start to finish lines and the basic materials that are needed for the batteries, through the battery making facilities through the electric vehicle assembly. All of that has to build out to be able to get us to a point where you start seeing electric vehicles come anywhere near approaching internal combustion vehicles on the road. So this is multiple years and all of these manufacturers are focused on debottlenecking that whole supply chain, which is going to be in the news for years to come. I think the one other question. I mean the IRA, obviously, that helps there as well as it does with other renewable providers. We've talked before about First Solar, for instance. We talked about Oxy's 1.5 initiative. So we're seeing more and more of these come online across our verticals and people are doing it because it's important for their business models. And again, that's not a femoral thing. That's going to be over multiple years. Sure. Yes, it's broad-based. I mean, we're very happy with the way that our business is balanced between discrete and hybrid and process applications with big opportunities in all of them. I mean, as we talk about EV and battery in discrete, we talk about food and beverage and life sciences, food and beverage is our single biggest vertical in hybrid. And then in process, I highlighted some particularly strong order activity with Sensia, but we also continue to see good activity in metals as well. So it's across all of them. Now in terms of the margin, one to the next there's high-margin opportunities in each one. I would say that the engineered systems are concentrated a little bit more heavily on the process side. Those customers are more often looking for engineering content to complement the hardware coming from the same provider. So you'd probably see a little bit lower margin there due to the people intensivity of that, but good opportunities in the funnel for near and midterm orders across all of the industry segments. Yes. So the net opportunity for Rockwell actually goes up as we go from internal combustion engines to EVs, and that's for a couple of reasons. First of all, the traditional drivetrain operations. That's a more subtractive manufacturing process, that's boring cylinders, that's finishing metal surfaces and things like that. And that's largely done with computer numerical control, which is not a technology that Rockwell directly has. We have good partnerships, but it's not something that we provide directly. And so when that's replaced by some of the operations in electric vehicles, most notably, the battery formation and packing and assembly. That's more of an assembly type operation. And there's aspects at the front end of that with batch processes. And those are all applications that Rockwell has great readiness to serve. Then when you look at what you specifically mentioned in the joining part of it, it's more complex press operations, and Rockwell has great press control systems. So as the metal formation becomes more complex, again, those are really good applications for Rockwell with our program of control as well as our expanded drive control. So we feel good about those opportunities. And then added to those basic automation applications. It's the software that's a more pervasive part of the electric vehicle and battery manufacturing process, and we have really good solutions there. No. I don't have a specific answer for where chemical is moderating other than to say our focus in chemical is more on the specialty chemical, fine chemical as opposed to bulk chemicals."

Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations and Market Strategy. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead.\nAijana Zellner: Thank you, Julianne. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include and our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company, and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and details in all our SEC filings. So with that, I'll hand it over to Blake.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our first quarter results on Slide 3. I'm pleased with our team's exceptional focus and execution as we delivered another quarter of strong growth and profitability. Organic sales and earnings were both up year-over-year and better than we expected this quarter. Rockwell's continued investments in resiliency and agility, along with a gradually improving supply chain environment, helped more than offset many of the headwinds we faced heading into Q1. Orders and backlog were up sequentially in the quarter. Order cancellation rates were flat to prior quarter and remain in the low single digits through January. We are encouraged by the continued strength of our end user demand across all business segments and regions. Total sales grew almost 7% versus prior year. Organic sales were up 10% year-over-year, better than our expectations despite a very dynamic supply chain environment. Currency translation reduced sales by 4% and acquisitions contributed about a point of growth this quarter. Consistent with our prior assumptions, the split of sales by business segment, region and industry was impacted by access to specific electronic components and the composition of our backlog. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales increased about 7% versus prior year with growth in all regions and product lines. We had another quarter of remarkable order growth in our independent cart technology business, driven by large multi-year deals across many industries including EV, material handling and semiconductor. I'll cover some of these strategic wins in a few minutes. Software and Control organic sales grew almost 16% versus prior year. Better than expected growth was driven by our team's ability to quickly redesign and requalify certain Logix products to secure additional components supply with the support from key suppliers. We also continue to see a gradual improvement in electronic component supply. Lifecycle Services organic sales were up 10% year-over-year. Book-to-bill in this segment was a healthy 1.21 and was consistent across solutions, services and Sensia businesses. Information Solutions and Connected Services sales had another quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. We are seeing a significant uptick here in large multisite and multiyear deals, both in software and services. One of our Information Solutions wins this quarter was with a leading potato processing company, where a combination of our Kalypso digital consulting and enterprise analytics capabilities helped the customer increase throughput and reduce energy costs across multiple production lines. We're proud to be an important digital partner to this global company as they focus on doubling their revenue over the next five years. Our recent software acquisitions continue to land us new logos across various industries and regions. These include Plex wins in metals, food and beverage and automotive and numerous enterprise asset management wins Fiix's cloud-native offering in Asia, where we are leveraging the distribution network to amplify our sales with local customers. On the Connected Services side, we continue to build momentum with enterprise cybersecurity wins with customers across food and beverage, life sciences and consumer packaged goods, prioritizing their investments and resiliency of their operations. One of our key cyber wins this quarter was with one of the world's largest global consumer goods companies, who chose Rockwell's differentiated portfolio of hardware, software and services along with the capabilities of our partner Claroty to manage OT security at hundreds of their sites globally. This multiyear deal will also contribute to our double-digit growth in annual recurring revenue. Q1 ARR grew 14%. Segment margin of 20% was up over 100 basis points year-over-year and was better than expected. Adjusted EPS grew 15% year-over-year. Let's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q1 end market performance. All three industry segments saw strong year-over-year growth and were above expectations, consistent with the continued gradual improvement in electronic component availability. In our discrete industries, sales were up low teens. Within discrete, automotive sales were up 25% versus prior year. We continue to win new and follow-on orders with both the brand owners and the supporting EV ecosystem, including vehicle and battery OEMs and system integrators. A good example of Rockwell's strong position in EV this quarter is our win with a leading battery supplier. Our independent cart technology was selected for the battery cell assembly and formation process to support Ford's BlueOval greenfield plants in Kentucky and Tennessee. We talked about our strategic partnership with Ford at our Investor Day last November, and we are excited about the progress we are making together. Semiconductor sales grew over 20% versus prior year. This is another vertical where we are able to expand our offerings to new applications, including independent cart for wafer transport and Logix-based automation for silicon carbide wafer manufacturing. In eCommerce and warehouse automation, our sales were down low teens versus prior year. Some of our largest eCommerce customers are in the process of shifting their investment from greenfield to brownfield, and we expect continued investments in upgrading existing facilities, including next-gen sortation systems over the course of this fiscal year. One of our large multiyear wins in eCommerce this quarter was with CMC, a leader in smart solutions for sustainable packaging. Rockwell's smart machine architecture, which includes our full portfolio of hardware and software, will help CMC produce its innovative on-demand packaging at scale. Another important win in the quarter was with Phononic, a technology company focused on unique heating and cooling systems. This customer is working with our Kalypso team to create the cloud and IoT infrastructure necessary to support Phononic's disruptive design for cold chain solutions and warehouse applications. Moving to our Hybrid industry segment. Sales in this segment grew low teens year-over-year, led by strong growth in food and beverage. Food and beverage sales were up over 15% versus prior year. As I mentioned earlier, we saw a number of large cybersecurity wins in this vertical, underscoring customers' focus on resiliency and security in their operations. Life Sciences sales grew mid-single digits in the quarter. In addition to software, we saw a high number of cybersecurity wins in this end market this quarter with several important wins coming from Europe. Tire was also up mid-single digits in the quarter. Let's turn to Process. This segment grew mid-single digits versus prior year, led by growth in metals and oil and gas. We rarely talk about our metals vertical, but we had an important sustainability win with Cornish Lithium, a pioneering mineral exploration and development company, who chose Rockwell's PlantPAx process control system for its demo plant to convert lithium concentrate into high-grade refined lithium used for battery production. We are excited to partner with Cornish Lithium on this energy transition journey. Turning now to Slide 5 in our Q1 organic regional sales. Similar to last fiscal year, our performance here is a reflection of electronic component availability rather than the underlying customer demand. North America organic sales grew 8% year-over-year, Latin America sales were up 6%, EMEA sales increased by over 13% and Asia Pacific was up 16%. Let's now move to Slide 6, fiscal 2023 outlook. Given our Q1 performance, our record backlog and a gradually improving supply chain we are increasing our top line and bottom line outlook for fiscal 2023. While we are encouraged by the improving electronic component landscape, the macroeconomic environment is still very dynamic and we continue to take a conservative approach in our operations. Our fiscal 2023 guidance projects total reported sales growth of 12%. Organic sales growth of 13% at the midpoint assumes continued supply chain improvement. The majority of our fiscal 2023 shipments are already in backlog. We continue to expect acquisitions to contribute a point of profitable growth and currency to be a headwind of about 2 points. Nick will touch more on this later. ARR is still expected to grow 15%. Segment margin is expected to increase by over 100 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow 17% versus prior year and we continue to target 95% free cash flow conversion. Let me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q1 performance and financial outlook for fiscal 2023. Nick?\nNick Gangestad: Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8, first quarter key financial information. First quarter reported sales were up 6.7% over last year, Q1 organic sales were up 9.9% and acquisitions contributed 80 basis points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by 4 points. About 7 points of our organic growth came from price. Segment operating margin expanded to 20.2% and was significantly higher than our expectations. The majority of our margin improvement versus our expectations was driven by the higher revenue from the redesign activity and improved electronic component availability that Blake discussed earlier. The 110 basis point year-over-year increase in margin was driven by positive price cost and higher sales volume, partially offset by higher investment spend. Corporate and other expense was $27 million, in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $2.46 was ahead of our expectations and grew 15% versus prior year. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on the later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 17.1%. This was in line with our expectations and aligned with our full year estimate of an 18% adjusted effective tax rate. Free cash flow of $42 million was $91 million higher compared to last year, driven by higher pre-tax income. As in recent quarters, working capital continued to grow sequentially. We expect one more quarter of working capital increases this year. We expect working capital balances to decline slightly in the second half of the year as our supply chain gradually improves. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased approximately 600,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $156 million. On December 31st, $1.1 billion remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Organic sales grew double digits in Software and Control and Lifecycle Services, with Intelligent Devices growing 7% year-over-year. As Blake mentioned earlier, orders grew sequentially in Q1 as we saw a healthy demand driven by continued strong project activity with our customers. We continue to see customer ordering patterns consistent with the longer lead times we have for portions of our portfolio. We expect further normalization of ordering patterns as lead times and different products improve. Turning to margins. Intelligent Devices margin declined by 130 basis points year-over-year due to higher resiliency spend and an unfavorable currency impact, partially offset by positive impact from higher price cost. Segment margin for software and control increased 630 basis points compared to last year on positive price cost, the favorable year-over-year impact of Plex and higher sales. Lifecycle Services margin was roughly flat year-over-year. Similar to Q2 fiscal year 2022, we expect Lifecycle Services margin to expand through the balance of the year. The next Slide 10 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q1 fiscal 2022 to Q1 fiscal 2023. Core performance was up $0.55 on a 9.9% organic sales increase. The impact of currency was a $0.15 reduction in earnings per share. This was slightly better than our expectations. The year-over-year impact was due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Incentive compensation was a $0.10 headwind, slightly more than our original plan and driven by our increased growth and earnings expectations for the year. Our higher adjusted effective tax rate was a $0.05 headwind and our reduction in outstanding shares added about $0.05. Let's move on to the next Slide, 11, guidance for fiscal 2023. We are increasing our reported sales guidance to about $8.7 billion in fiscal 2023 or 12% growth at the midpoint. We expect organic sales growth to be in a range of 11% to 15% or 13% at the midpoint of our range. We expect volume to be 9 points of growth and price to be 4 points of growth. This guidance takes into account our Q1 outperformance and is based on our current view of electronic component availability and the rate at which we can deliver on our backlog. By quarter, we expect organic growth rates in Q2 and Q3 to be the highest of the year with each up in the mid to high teens year-over-year, while Q4 revenue is expected to grow organically single digits. While we expect sales to be up sequentially in Q2, we expect margins to be similar to Q1 levels due to higher sequential spend on new product development, resiliency and the timing of our annual merit increase. We now expect a full year currency headwind of 200 basis points, which is 50 basis points better than our previous guidance. This updated outlook primarily reflects the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar. We expect full year segment operating margin to be about 21%, up from prior guidance of about 20.5%. We continue to expect positive price/cost for the full year, with most of the favorability coming from the price actions we took in fiscal 2022. As expected, the majority of our year-over-year price/cost benefit this year is coming in the first half of the year. Our updated guidance now assumes full year core earnings conversion of around 35%. We continue to expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 18%. We are increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $10.70 to $11.50. At the midpoint of this range, this represents 17% adjusted EPS growth, up from the prior guidance of approximately 12% at the midpoint. We expect full year fiscal 2023 free cash flow conversion of about 95% of adjusted income. A few additional comments on fiscal 2023 guidance. Corporate and other expense is still expected to be around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2023 is now expected to be about $130 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.4 million shares. We've also included on Slide 12 an adjusted EPS walk from our previous guidance to our current guidance at the midpoint for your reference. With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake?\nBlake Moret: Thanks Nick. In this dynamic environment, we are positioning ourselves and our customers for a more resilient, agile and sustainable future. Automation has never been more important in solving our customers' biggest challenges. A large percentage of these global investments are being made in the U.S., where we have the strongest market share, the best channel and decades-long relationships. Shoring is real for many of our most important verticals, and we see these investments, along with the early benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act, reflected in our continued, strong order rates. We are accelerating the pace of our innovation, including new product introductions across all key product platforms and our recent acquisitions. These were showcased at our very successful automation fair in Chicago, where we welcomed over 18,000 customers, partners and employees to an amazing demonstration of the value provided by Rockwell and our friends. I was also able to meet our new CUBIC team in Denmark a few weeks ago, and I am excited about the new opportunities to expand our sustainability portfolio with an increased presence in renewables, CUBIC's largest customer segment. Importantly, I'm happy with how our culture is both embraced and enriched by our recent additions. And I'm excited to see how we deliver strong growth and new customer value together in the years to come. Aijana will now begin the Q&A Session.\nAijana Zellner: Thanks, Blake. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Julienne, let's take our first question.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nScott Davis: Hey good morning Blake, and Nick and Aijana. \nBlake Moret: Hey Scott.\nAijana Zellner: Good morning.\nScott Davis: You guys mentioned a couple of times electronics availability as being still a gating factor. Maybe a little bit more color on that in context kind of how that compares perhaps even just the last quarter and prior quarters and also maybe just some context around the product categories or the geographies where it's particularly still acute?\nBlake Moret: Sure. Thanks, Scott. So we characterize the general landscape as generally improving. And I think that's still the case. We use a lot of chips across our product lines. And I think most notable for the quarter's results was our ability to mitigate the specific issue that we were concerned about affecting software and control when we talked last. We were able to move quick we had good relationships with the involved supplier that helped us mitigate that risk. But in general, we're seeing chips improve across a broad landscape, but it's not going to happen overnight. And so we continue to work with those suppliers to improve the remaining constrained chips and some of those are in software and control, some of them are in intelligent devices. And then, of course, because Lifecycle Services uses products from both of those business segments, there's some secondary effects there as well. But the view is optimistic, but all it takes is one chip and a product to keep from being able to ship it. And so it's not all clear yet.\nScott Davis: Blake, is that impacting kind of customer order patterns still? I mean is there still so much fear that lead times are too long that folks are potentially holding on to a little extra inventory here and there? Or is that not an issue because they were never able to hold on to inventory because they couldn't get any product to begin with?\nBlake Moret: Yes, it's going to be uneven by different product lines. So, we do have product lines in our portfolio that have pretty much returned to pre-shortage, pre-pandemic levels in terms of lead times. The majority of our product offering is still at elevated lead times. We still see OEMs placing big orders for more months of coverage for their machine needs than they would like to, than they will when we return to more normal lead times there. So it's still a factor, but it's improving, and we expect it to improve through the year.\nScott Davis: Okay, congrats and best of luck this year, guys. Thank you.\nBlake Moret: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning everyone.\nBlake Moret: Hey Andy.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Blake, as you started calendar 2023, have you noticed any change in customer conversations around their CapEx plans in any of your end markets that concerns you? And then you talk about how you're thinking about your backlog moving forward? Obviously, it continues to be unusually high. Given the current demand environment, does it seem likely at this point that you end FY2023 with still relatively high backlog that sets you up for a pretty strong 2024?\nBlake Moret: Yes, let me start with that one first, Andy. We're going to have far higher backlog at the end of fiscal 2023 than traditional levels. That's clear. We saw sequential growth in backlog from Q4 to Q1. And with the demand that we're seeing, then we expect backlog to continue to be high as we head into fiscal year 2024. Now in terms of customers' CapEx behavior, the industries that we've highlighted as needing to make, let's say, once in a generation changes in their capacity, that's continuing. And we do track announced CapEx investments across the verticals that are important to us, and we continue to see high levels of investment in EV and battery. Semiconductor isn't on quite the same ramp up of quarter-over-quarter growth of new announcements but it's at a very high level even as that moderates. And as we've talked about, we're seeing increasing share of wallet in those fabs. So that's good news. Food and beverage, we talked about some of the areas, particularly of new value that they are investing in, probably a split of both CapEx and OpEx when they are looking at cybersecurity and some of the information solutions that we're adding. And energy continues to be a positive area where we expect for the full year, oil and gas is going to be double-digit growth for us.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Very helpful, Blake. And then Nick, maybe I could just ask you for more color on how you are thinking about price versus cost. You mentioned the 7% price in Q1. I think last quarter; you said price cost would be 100 basis points positive tailwind for the year. Has that expanded at on, how are you thinking about the stickiness of your pricing as supply chain-related headwinds begin to subside?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, the guidance I gave last \u2013 three months ago that we expect about 100 basis points of margin expansion through price cost, that holds. It's more or less almost exactly what we said then. The way we see it progressing through the year, we see the majority of, in fact, the vast majority of that year-over-year change improvement happening in the first half of the year. We expected and we continue to expect approximately or a little under 200 basis points of margin expansion in the first half of the year, year-over-year on price cost and that moving down to about 50 basis points of expansion from price cost in the second half of the year. That's not a deterioration as it goes on, that's more a statement of the comps we're going against in fiscal year 2022. Going beyond that, in terms of price cost, now we're getting into 2024, and I'm just not ready to be giving any guidance on how we're seeing price cost beyond that.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Appreciate it Nick.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: Hey thank you. Good morning everybody. \nBlake Moret: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Hey, good morning. Just a couple for me. First, just on supply chain and kind of the whole redesign dynamic, Blake. Does this actually create some permanent cost advantage, or actually is the redesign work kind of a negative makeshift thing that needs to kind of be corrected further down the road when the supply chain improves more?\nBlake Moret: Yes, this is going to make us stronger for the future. The additional redundancy, the qualification of additional components, the work to design basically new bills and material with less constrained components with better suppliers to ensure that that flow is more resilient, long term, that's going to be a net benefit to our overall supply chain. There is some overhead in terms of additional cost that's being directed towards those resiliency efforts, and that will wane over time. But currently, that does contribute to some of the additional costs that we're seeing. But we're already seeing the benefits. And I think mid and long term, that will also continue to be a real strength as we, like all our customers, are looking to increase their resiliency.\nJeff Sprague: And then maybe just another kind of a two-parter for me. First on IRA, I was a little surprised to hear you say you're seeing some benefits there. I know like in wind and some other areas things are kind of gummed up waiting on rule promulgation. So I wonder if you could comment on what you're actually seeing there. And then secondly, on semi, I think, your historical strength has been on the material handling side of the house. And I would think independent cart is a better version of material handling in many respects. But could you maybe size in percentage terms or however you could frame it, how your potential share of wallet is changing in semi with your newer offerings?\nBlake Moret: Sure. So Jeff, you asked about the IRA and what specifically are we seeing there. A couple of thoughts come to mind with that. One, we've showcased the work that we're doing with First Solar, including some of their greenfields, which they've stated were helped along by IRA funding for renewable energy. And so we're proud of the relationship we've had for many years with First Solar. We're doing the controls and now the digital twins in their facilities. They would not have introduced as many greenfield projects without IRA funding. And so that's an example where it helped them, which helps us because they are a good partner. The second is some of the provisions in the IRA on U.S. manufacturing. When an automobile manufacturer builds a plant in the U.S., there is a higher probability that we're going to get large content because of our strong position here. And so that's also what's helping us as well. And again, it's the increased investment in the U.S. by the brand owners. But then when it comes to the U.S., for the reasons I talked about earlier and that you're well aware of we have an unmatched position. So for the second part of your question, semiconductor and what are we doing there? For a long time, our core strength has been in areas of facilities management and control systems. So that's controlling the temperature, the humidity, the cleanliness of the clean room environment. We've done that for a long time in Asia. And as more fabs are being built in the U.S., again, we're extending that capability and share of wallet here. It's also in clean room process tools. And with some of the tooling suppliers, we've enjoyed a good relationship for a very long time. And that's a combination of hardware as well as our project management and engineer-to-order expertise. More recently, cybersecurity has been a factor and has added millions of dollars of new business as we're helping harden these facilities to make them more resilient against cyber-attacks. And the wafer transport that we've talked about a couple of times, that independent cart technology that we talk a lot about in EV and other industries, is really valuable here as well. And we're starting to win big, multimillion dollar projects in several of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. And then the final one that I mentioned was a silicon carbide becomes a scale technology. We're starting to use it in our own products. We're seeing some logic-based automation there, and that's exciting because they are using a standard architecture rather than a lot of the custom PC-based control systems that have characterized that industry for a long time. So hopefully, that gets at the heart of those questions, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: It does, thank you.\nBlake Moret: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead your line is open.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning guys.\nBlake Moret: Hi, Josh.\nNick Gangestad: Hi, Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Blake, just trying to balance out here some of what you're seeing out there versus what we're seeing in the macro, I guess the Fed is trying to create some more employment flag deliberately, and you would think that productivity and automation are sort of a foil for that, but it doesn't really seem to be showing up in orders. And I know some of the markets you mentioned in the prepared remarks where things like food and beverage and life science and EV, and maybe there's just not as much demand variability there. But how do you see kind of this cyclical versus secular balance? And are customers making these investments kind of with the expectation that demand will slow down and these are imperatives anyway?\nBlake Moret: Yes, I think, there is a blend of things going on. First of all, there is the investment in new technologies that all of the players in the industry, like EV, have a real fear of missing out on. We\u2019ve got the idea that they're going to take a pause based on the macroeconomic concerns and let their competitors build out their fleets and be far ahead of them in terms of their ability to turn out hundreds of thousands of vehicles a year, they just can't wait. And so they are having to power through a still dynamic economic environment. And of course, that's EV and battery. I would say it's also semiconductor as well, where they have to build this capacity. In general, we're seeing across a broader spectrum of verticals the idea that automation is going to help them be more resilient and is going to enable greater productivity from their workforce. So it's not so much about the direct substitution of automation for labor, it's making that labor more productive. And I think that's a general trend that we're seeing across other of our verticals, food and beverage, pharma, and so on. So we're seeing that. We're not tone-deaf to the concerns about the economy. And in terms of our own operations, when I talk about taking a conservative approach, we're watching that. We're prudently adding resources as needed to fuel new growth, but we're very aware of the macro. It's just not going to have as much of an effect on us in the current fiscal year because of a huge backlog that we have, and we're building backlog that's going to go well into 2024 and beyond.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Got you. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on maybe putting some of these announcements we see out there in context. I think the White House put out something fairly recently, talking about across different verticals like ones you mentioned, some $350 billion [ph] or $400 billion [ph] worth of projects over the next several years. What's sort of the automation exposure within that for some of these bigger announcements? Is it 2% of the spend? 10% of the spend? Just trying to maybe kind of dimensionalize that versus kind of the bigger numbers that we see?\nBlake Moret: Yes. Josh, I wish I could construct an equation that would give you the percentages by vertical and give us our guide for us. But unfortunately, there's a huge amount of variability between the different industries. And of course, between greenfield, brownfield and so on, a lot of the brownfield-type investments are going to carry with it a higher percentage. So some of those are dedicated to the things that we offer in terms of automation and information management and the related services. The percentage spend for a new fab or a major new EV complex, it's going to be a small percentage of the total. And our job is to maximize the wins in our traditional value, but work really hard as we're doing in areas like semi and EV to add share of wallet, like we're doing with independent cart really in both of those as we're doing in software on the EV side and so on. So I hope that while that percentage of the total CapEx remains fairly low, it's high value, it's profitable and it's growing each year.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Very helpful as always. Thank you.\nBlake Moret: Yes. Thanks Josh.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to circle back to the margins, as that was the main area of surprise, I guess in the quarter. So I think Nick, you talked about a 20% segment margin in the first half and sort of 22% in the second half. Is it life cycle services that's seeing that biggest kind of half-on-half ramp? And then also, any help you could give us on thinking about the Software & Control operating leverage? I think that averaged about 70% in the last three quarters, so exceptionally high performance. How should we think about that on a sort of run rate ahead?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. Julian thanks for the question there. In terms of moving from roughly 20% margin in the first half of the year to 22% margin in the second half of the year, yes, lifecycle services is one of the bigger contributors to that step up as we see lifecycle services going up through the year. But we're expecting margin expansion in all of our segments year-over-year in fiscal year 2023. And lifecycle services just a little bit over the total average for margin expansion that we're expecting. So that's how we're seeing it. In terms of Software & Control, like Julian, just one of the things I just want to point out, as you look at some of the leverage that we're getting, if you're looking at the base, that was including what I was calling out a year ago of some of our incremental expenses related to Plex. So as an example, in our a little over 600 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year in the first quarter in Software & Control, there's about 200 basis points of that, that came from the year-over-year change in what we're experiencing in Plex as we're largely driven by some of those onetime expenses that we had in 2022. In terms of the overall leverage and conversion that we expect in Software & Control, we don't really give it down to that \u2013 at a segment level like that. We \u2013 you've often hear me talk about our 30% to 35% core conversion. That's more inclusive of everything. But as we grow Software & Control, we continue to expect that that's going to create margin enhancement. That's one of the things that we expect that will enhance our margin. It is also a business that is attracting more of our incremental growth investments as well as we put more investment in that. So Julian, that's just part of the balance. I'd like you to keep in mind on that.\nJulian Mitchell: That's very helpful. Thanks Nick. And then maybe one just for Blake, on the sort of process industry vertical. So I think you talked about mid-single-digit growth there in the first quarter, and you'll pick up steam as the year goes on. Is that just a function of kind of sort of faster backlog recognition in Process Industries as the year goes on? Is there any sort of particular vertical within process that you think will drive that pickup over the balance of the year versus what you saw in the first quarter?\nBlake Moret: Yes. Julian, oil and gas is where we expect a particularly strong ramp from mid-single digit to double-digit. We also see a little bit of that in related chemical industries, particularly the fine chemical applications that are really our sweet spot. Orders continued strong for oil and gas and other verticals in process. They continue, as I mentioned before to see some supply chain shortages that put a little bit of pressure on the shipments in the quarter. But we're comfortable and confident with the continued orders and with the really strong backlog that we'll see the double-digit growth for the full year.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nBlake Moret: I should mention \u2013 I should just mention, since we're talking about process if you were at Automation Fair, you saw the new high availability Process IO. So it's not just the traditional value that we're providing, but the strength of some of our recent acquisitions and new product introduction. And as we release over the coming months that high availability IO, that's a major step change in our capabilities in our PlantPAx system. So that's something that had been a gap for a period of time, and we're very happy with the way that the IO has turned out and the endorsement by process customers.\nJulian Mitchell: That's a good remainder. Thanks Blake.\nBlake Moret: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSteve Tusa: Hi. Good morning.\nBlake Moret: Hi Steve.\nNick Gangestad: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Congrats on the execution on the quarter.\nBlake Moret: Thank you.\nSteve Tusa: Just on the orders, maybe just a little bit more color. I mean it looks like the lifecycle services orders were up sequentially. You said that total orders were up sequentially. I mean any kind of frame of rough magnitude? I mean should we assume kind of modest sequential growth? Maybe just give us color on total book-to-bill. Was it in around that kind of 1.1 type of area? Maybe just a little bit more high-level color on where the orders landed?\nBlake Moret: Yes, the orders were strong. We continue to give the book-to-bill specifically for lifecycle services, which was at 1.21. And overall, for the company, as we talked about orders and backlog being sequentially up, meaning, obviously, orders were in excess of the shipments for the quarter, it's across the segments and it's across the regions as we see that continued demand. And we will see continued high backlog levels even with the strong shipments and the increased guide, we'll see very strong backlog at the end of 2023 as we go into 2024.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Like up low-singles for total order, something in that range?\nBlake Moret: Yes. We haven't talked about it other than to say it\u2019s healthy sequential orders because we think the sequential information and the cancellation rates, which we also talked about being flat and remaining in low-single-digits, we think those are the most important factors going forward.\nSteve Tusa: Right. And the price embedded in those orders, I mean, to get from up \u2013 I think you said 7% this quarter to up 4% in the year, it looks like that prices obviously decelerating. I mean the comps on price get tougher. Is the price in the orders somewhat similar to the price you're booking in revenues today? And are you pretty much booked when it comes to future price increases at this stage?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Steve, as far as the pricing, what the pricing that we're going to experience for the balance of fiscal year 2023 is all or virtually all of it already baked into our backlog based on the orders that we have and the pricing we put in that. And that will be showing sequential price improvement from what we're seeing right now, just based on how that backlog is playing out. In terms of the guide I'm giving for the full year that is not representing an aspect of price starting to come down from the pricing level we're seeing in the first half. It's just a recognition of \u2013 we had virtually no price growth in the first half of fiscal year 2022, and then we had more significant price growth in the second half of fiscal year 2022. So that change from the \u2013 it's all based on comp, not on any kind of deceleration there.\nBlake Moret: And if I could just add to that, yes, we did have an additional price increase in December, so in this fiscal year. And apart from the announcements of specific price increases, we've talked over the last year of being more agile in terms of getting the recognition of the prices by changing our methodology with customers and with the channel. And I would just say that's proceeding smoothly and with our expectations in terms of being able to be more agile as future price increases are introduced.\nSteve Tusa: Sorry, one more quick one, because you guys mentioned it at the Investor Day, any feedback from the channel on how \u2013 on the behavior around this January cancellation policy change?\nBlake Moret: Yes. As we talked about the new cancellation policy on orders, that's more of a hygiene type of issue. We didn't expect it to affect order patterns, and that's exactly our experience is that it did not have a significant impact on order patterns. But we got it in, and I think it's a healthy part of our processes.\nSteve Tusa: Yes. All right. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.\nBlake Moret: Yes. Thanks Steve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brendan Luecke from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrendan Luecke: Good morning all. Thanks for taking my question.\nBlake Moret: Hey Brendan.\nBrendan Luecke: So question, as you look through this current cycle for CapEx, how are you thinking about recurring revenues on the back of your expanded installed base?\nBlake Moret: Yes. So we've had a big focus on adding ARR. We've talked much more formally about it here in the last couple of years. And while it's still a relatively small part of our total business, I like starting each year with that recurring revenue. It gives you a reason for being constantly intimate with our customers and the whole land and expand motion is well understood to be a good source of ongoing value. We like our position in terms of having that, growing double-digits, and being able to complement it with the physical goods that we're shipping that are still being sold on a perpetual basis, a one-time PO. But over time, we expect to add additional software and services to our annual recurring revenue streams as well as hardware where that makes sense. One of the phenomenon is as we're in our second year of double-digit growth, because our overall business is growing so fast, the ARR as a percentage of the total is not increasing a huge amount, but it is more than keeping pace. And so we're happy with it. We're retooling our internal business processes to be able to take orders with a mix of hardware, software and services to make it easier and easier for customers and channel to be able to restack and expand the content in those subscriptions and so on. So we're happy with the progress there.\nBrendan Luecke: Thank you.\nAijana Zellner: Julienne, we'll take one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nNoah Kaye: Thanks so much. So I just want to clarify a couple of quick questions. Number one, you mentioned that after implementing the cancellation policy, it didn't really appear to impact order patterns. So just to clarify, you've seen orders trending still healthy here so far in 2Q? You've not seen any pull forward?\nBlake Moret: We see some pull forward that was in Q1 that was more a factor from the price increase. But even without that, we had orders that would have contributed to strong sequential growth. So any pull forward would not have had much to do with the cancellation policy, but there would have been some pull forward in Q1 that would have been a factor of the price increase that we introduced then. We are also seeing, as I mentioned in Q1, strong project activity with multi-site and multiyear deals, and that was significant in Q1.\nNoah Kaye: Right. And then a lot of talk positively around IRA and its long-term impacts; do you get any sense that, that some of the customer base is still waiting on treasury guidance for some of these credits and the like to make some decisions around investment? Any sort of sense of what that forthcoming guidance could mean in terms of opening up orders?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, I know I think that's a fair assumption. Like we clearly have seen some activity of what we think of increased activity as a result, but there still is some portions waiting to be clarified. And I think it's a very fair assumption to think that some of our customers are waiting to see what that clarity is. I know, in our own case we're doing more evaluation and waiting to what some of the provisions means to us. So I think it's fair to assume our customers are doing the same thing.\nNoah Kaye: Yes. So very helpful. All right, thanks so much.\nBlake Moret: Thanks Noah.\nOperator: We are out of time for questions today. I would like to turn the call back over to Ms. Zellner to close out the call.\nAijana Zellner: Thanks Julienne. That concludes today's call. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. At this time you may disconnect. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nick Gangestad",
            "content": "Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8, first quarter key financial information. First quarter reported sales were up 6.7% over last year, Q1 organic sales were up 9.9% and acquisitions contributed 80 basis points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by 4 points. About 7 points of our organic growth came from price. Segment operating margin expanded to 20.2% and was significantly higher than our expectations. The majority of our margin improvement versus our expectations was driven by the higher revenue from the redesign activity and improved electronic component availability that Blake discussed earlier. The 110 basis point year-over-year increase in margin was driven by positive price cost and higher sales volume, partially offset by higher investment spend. Corporate and other expense was $27 million, in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $2.46 was ahead of our expectations and grew 15% versus prior year. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on the later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 17.1%. This was in line with our expectations and aligned with our full year estimate of an 18% adjusted effective tax rate. Free cash flow of $42 million was $91 million higher compared to last year, driven by higher pre-tax income. As in recent quarters, working capital continued to grow sequentially. We expect one more quarter of working capital increases this year. We expect working capital balances to decline slightly in the second half of the year as our supply chain gradually improves. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased approximately 600,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $156 million. On December 31st, $1.1 billion remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Organic sales grew double digits in Software and Control and Lifecycle Services, with Intelligent Devices growing 7% year-over-year. As Blake mentioned earlier, orders grew sequentially in Q1 as we saw a healthy demand driven by continued strong project activity with our customers. We continue to see customer ordering patterns consistent with the longer lead times we have for portions of our portfolio. We expect further normalization of ordering patterns as lead times and different products improve. Turning to margins. Intelligent Devices margin declined by 130 basis points year-over-year due to higher resiliency spend and an unfavorable currency impact, partially offset by positive impact from higher price cost. Segment margin for software and control increased 630 basis points compared to last year on positive price cost, the favorable year-over-year impact of Plex and higher sales. Lifecycle Services margin was roughly flat year-over-year. Similar to Q2 fiscal year 2022, we expect Lifecycle Services margin to expand through the balance of the year. The next Slide 10 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q1 fiscal 2022 to Q1 fiscal 2023. Core performance was up $0.55 on a 9.9% organic sales increase. The impact of currency was a $0.15 reduction in earnings per share. This was slightly better than our expectations. The year-over-year impact was due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Incentive compensation was a $0.10 headwind, slightly more than our original plan and driven by our increased growth and earnings expectations for the year. Our higher adjusted effective tax rate was a $0.05 headwind and our reduction in outstanding shares added about $0.05. Let's move on to the next Slide, 11, guidance for fiscal 2023. We are increasing our reported sales guidance to about $8.7 billion in fiscal 2023 or 12% growth at the midpoint. We expect organic sales growth to be in a range of 11% to 15% or 13% at the midpoint of our range. We expect volume to be 9 points of growth and price to be 4 points of growth. This guidance takes into account our Q1 outperformance and is based on our current view of electronic component availability and the rate at which we can deliver on our backlog. By quarter, we expect organic growth rates in Q2 and Q3 to be the highest of the year with each up in the mid to high teens year-over-year, while Q4 revenue is expected to grow organically single digits. While we expect sales to be up sequentially in Q2, we expect margins to be similar to Q1 levels due to higher sequential spend on new product development, resiliency and the timing of our annual merit increase. We now expect a full year currency headwind of 200 basis points, which is 50 basis points better than our previous guidance. This updated outlook primarily reflects the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar. We expect full year segment operating margin to be about 21%, up from prior guidance of about 20.5%. We continue to expect positive price/cost for the full year, with most of the favorability coming from the price actions we took in fiscal 2022. As expected, the majority of our year-over-year price/cost benefit this year is coming in the first half of the year. Our updated guidance now assumes full year core earnings conversion of around 35%. We continue to expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 18%. We are increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $10.70 to $11.50. At the midpoint of this range, this represents 17% adjusted EPS growth, up from the prior guidance of approximately 12% at the midpoint. We expect full year fiscal 2023 free cash flow conversion of about 95% of adjusted income. A few additional comments on fiscal 2023 guidance. Corporate and other expense is still expected to be around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2023 is now expected to be about $130 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.4 million shares. We've also included on Slide 12 an adjusted EPS walk from our previous guidance to our current guidance at the midpoint for your reference. With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake? Good morning, Andy. Yes, the guidance I gave last \u2013 three months ago that we expect about 100 basis points of margin expansion through price cost, that holds. It's more or less almost exactly what we said then. The way we see it progressing through the year, we see the majority of, in fact, the vast majority of that year-over-year change improvement happening in the first half of the year. We expected and we continue to expect approximately or a little under 200 basis points of margin expansion in the first half of the year, year-over-year on price cost and that moving down to about 50 basis points of expansion from price cost in the second half of the year. That's not a deterioration as it goes on, that's more a statement of the comps we're going against in fiscal year 2022. Going beyond that, in terms of price cost, now we're getting into 2024, and I'm just not ready to be giving any guidance on how we're seeing price cost beyond that. Hi, Josh. Yes. Julian thanks for the question there. In terms of moving from roughly 20% margin in the first half of the year to 22% margin in the second half of the year, yes, lifecycle services is one of the bigger contributors to that step up as we see lifecycle services going up through the year. But we're expecting margin expansion in all of our segments year-over-year in fiscal year 2023. And lifecycle services just a little bit over the total average for margin expansion that we're expecting. So that's how we're seeing it. In terms of Software & Control, like Julian, just one of the things I just want to point out, as you look at some of the leverage that we're getting, if you're looking at the base, that was including what I was calling out a year ago of some of our incremental expenses related to Plex. So as an example, in our a little over 600 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year in the first quarter in Software & Control, there's about 200 basis points of that, that came from the year-over-year change in what we're experiencing in Plex as we're largely driven by some of those onetime expenses that we had in 2022. In terms of the overall leverage and conversion that we expect in Software & Control, we don't really give it down to that \u2013 at a segment level like that. We \u2013 you've often hear me talk about our 30% to 35% core conversion. That's more inclusive of everything. But as we grow Software & Control, we continue to expect that that's going to create margin enhancement. That's one of the things that we expect that will enhance our margin. It is also a business that is attracting more of our incremental growth investments as well as we put more investment in that. So Julian, that's just part of the balance. I'd like you to keep in mind on that. Good morning, Steve. Yes, Steve, as far as the pricing, what the pricing that we're going to experience for the balance of fiscal year 2023 is all or virtually all of it already baked into our backlog based on the orders that we have and the pricing we put in that. And that will be showing sequential price improvement from what we're seeing right now, just based on how that backlog is playing out. In terms of the guide I'm giving for the full year that is not representing an aspect of price starting to come down from the pricing level we're seeing in the first half. It's just a recognition of \u2013 we had virtually no price growth in the first half of fiscal year 2022, and then we had more significant price growth in the second half of fiscal year 2022. So that change from the \u2013 it's all based on comp, not on any kind of deceleration there. Yes, I know I think that's a fair assumption. Like we clearly have seen some activity of what we think of increased activity as a result, but there still is some portions waiting to be clarified. And I think it's a very fair assumption to think that some of our customers are waiting to see what that clarity is. I know, in our own case we're doing more evaluation and waiting to what some of the provisions means to us. So I think it's fair to assume our customers are doing the same thing."

            "content": "Thanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our first quarter results on Slide 3. I'm pleased with our team's exceptional focus and execution as we delivered another quarter of strong growth and profitability. Organic sales and earnings were both up year-over-year and better than we expected this quarter. Rockwell's continued investments in resiliency and agility, along with a gradually improving supply chain environment, helped more than offset many of the headwinds we faced heading into Q1. Orders and backlog were up sequentially in the quarter. Order cancellation rates were flat to prior quarter and remain in the low single digits through January. We are encouraged by the continued strength of our end user demand across all business segments and regions. Total sales grew almost 7% versus prior year. Organic sales were up 10% year-over-year, better than our expectations despite a very dynamic supply chain environment. Currency translation reduced sales by 4% and acquisitions contributed about a point of growth this quarter. Consistent with our prior assumptions, the split of sales by business segment, region and industry was impacted by access to specific electronic components and the composition of our backlog. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales increased about 7% versus prior year with growth in all regions and product lines. We had another quarter of remarkable order growth in our independent cart technology business, driven by large multi-year deals across many industries including EV, material handling and semiconductor. I'll cover some of these strategic wins in a few minutes. Software and Control organic sales grew almost 16% versus prior year. Better than expected growth was driven by our team's ability to quickly redesign and requalify certain Logix products to secure additional components supply with the support from key suppliers. We also continue to see a gradual improvement in electronic component supply. Lifecycle Services organic sales were up 10% year-over-year. Book-to-bill in this segment was a healthy 1.21 and was consistent across solutions, services and Sensia businesses. Information Solutions and Connected Services sales had another quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. We are seeing a significant uptick here in large multisite and multiyear deals, both in software and services. One of our Information Solutions wins this quarter was with a leading potato processing company, where a combination of our Kalypso digital consulting and enterprise analytics capabilities helped the customer increase throughput and reduce energy costs across multiple production lines. We're proud to be an important digital partner to this global company as they focus on doubling their revenue over the next five years. Our recent software acquisitions continue to land us new logos across various industries and regions. These include Plex wins in metals, food and beverage and automotive and numerous enterprise asset management wins Fiix's cloud-native offering in Asia, where we are leveraging the distribution network to amplify our sales with local customers. On the Connected Services side, we continue to build momentum with enterprise cybersecurity wins with customers across food and beverage, life sciences and consumer packaged goods, prioritizing their investments and resiliency of their operations. One of our key cyber wins this quarter was with one of the world's largest global consumer goods companies, who chose Rockwell's differentiated portfolio of hardware, software and services along with the capabilities of our partner Claroty to manage OT security at hundreds of their sites globally. This multiyear deal will also contribute to our double-digit growth in annual recurring revenue. Q1 ARR grew 14%. Segment margin of 20% was up over 100 basis points year-over-year and was better than expected. Adjusted EPS grew 15% year-over-year. Let's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q1 end market performance. All three industry segments saw strong year-over-year growth and were above expectations, consistent with the continued gradual improvement in electronic component availability. In our discrete industries, sales were up low teens. Within discrete, automotive sales were up 25% versus prior year. We continue to win new and follow-on orders with both the brand owners and the supporting EV ecosystem, including vehicle and battery OEMs and system integrators. A good example of Rockwell's strong position in EV this quarter is our win with a leading battery supplier. Our independent cart technology was selected for the battery cell assembly and formation process to support Ford's BlueOval greenfield plants in Kentucky and Tennessee. We talked about our strategic partnership with Ford at our Investor Day last November, and we are excited about the progress we are making together. Semiconductor sales grew over 20% versus prior year. This is another vertical where we are able to expand our offerings to new applications, including independent cart for wafer transport and Logix-based automation for silicon carbide wafer manufacturing. In eCommerce and warehouse automation, our sales were down low teens versus prior year. Some of our largest eCommerce customers are in the process of shifting their investment from greenfield to brownfield, and we expect continued investments in upgrading existing facilities, including next-gen sortation systems over the course of this fiscal year. One of our large multiyear wins in eCommerce this quarter was with CMC, a leader in smart solutions for sustainable packaging. Rockwell's smart machine architecture, which includes our full portfolio of hardware and software, will help CMC produce its innovative on-demand packaging at scale. Another important win in the quarter was with Phononic, a technology company focused on unique heating and cooling systems. This customer is working with our Kalypso team to create the cloud and IoT infrastructure necessary to support Phononic's disruptive design for cold chain solutions and warehouse applications. Moving to our Hybrid industry segment. Sales in this segment grew low teens year-over-year, led by strong growth in food and beverage. Food and beverage sales were up over 15% versus prior year. As I mentioned earlier, we saw a number of large cybersecurity wins in this vertical, underscoring customers' focus on resiliency and security in their operations. Life Sciences sales grew mid-single digits in the quarter. In addition to software, we saw a high number of cybersecurity wins in this end market this quarter with several important wins coming from Europe. Tire was also up mid-single digits in the quarter. Let's turn to Process. This segment grew mid-single digits versus prior year, led by growth in metals and oil and gas. We rarely talk about our metals vertical, but we had an important sustainability win with Cornish Lithium, a pioneering mineral exploration and development company, who chose Rockwell's PlantPAx process control system for its demo plant to convert lithium concentrate into high-grade refined lithium used for battery production. We are excited to partner with Cornish Lithium on this energy transition journey. Turning now to Slide 5 in our Q1 organic regional sales. Similar to last fiscal year, our performance here is a reflection of electronic component availability rather than the underlying customer demand. North America organic sales grew 8% year-over-year, Latin America sales were up 6%, EMEA sales increased by over 13% and Asia Pacific was up 16%. Let's now move to Slide 6, fiscal 2023 outlook. Given our Q1 performance, our record backlog and a gradually improving supply chain we are increasing our top line and bottom line outlook for fiscal 2023. While we are encouraged by the improving electronic component landscape, the macroeconomic environment is still very dynamic and we continue to take a conservative approach in our operations. Our fiscal 2023 guidance projects total reported sales growth of 12%. Organic sales growth of 13% at the midpoint assumes continued supply chain improvement. The majority of our fiscal 2023 shipments are already in backlog. We continue to expect acquisitions to contribute a point of profitable growth and currency to be a headwind of about 2 points. Nick will touch more on this later. ARR is still expected to grow 15%. Segment margin is expected to increase by over 100 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow 17% versus prior year and we continue to target 95% free cash flow conversion. Let me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q1 performance and financial outlook for fiscal 2023. Nick? Thanks Nick. In this dynamic environment, we are positioning ourselves and our customers for a more resilient, agile and sustainable future. Automation has never been more important in solving our customers' biggest challenges. A large percentage of these global investments are being made in the U.S., where we have the strongest market share, the best channel and decades-long relationships. Shoring is real for many of our most important verticals, and we see these investments, along with the early benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act, reflected in our continued, strong order rates. We are accelerating the pace of our innovation, including new product introductions across all key product platforms and our recent acquisitions. These were showcased at our very successful automation fair in Chicago, where we welcomed over 18,000 customers, partners and employees to an amazing demonstration of the value provided by Rockwell and our friends. I was also able to meet our new CUBIC team in Denmark a few weeks ago, and I am excited about the new opportunities to expand our sustainability portfolio with an increased presence in renewables, CUBIC's largest customer segment. Importantly, I'm happy with how our culture is both embraced and enriched by our recent additions. And I'm excited to see how we deliver strong growth and new customer value together in the years to come. Aijana will now begin the Q&A Session. Hey Scott. Sure. Thanks, Scott. So we characterize the general landscape as generally improving. And I think that's still the case. We use a lot of chips across our product lines. And I think most notable for the quarter's results was our ability to mitigate the specific issue that we were concerned about affecting software and control when we talked last. We were able to move quick we had good relationships with the involved supplier that helped us mitigate that risk. But in general, we're seeing chips improve across a broad landscape, but it's not going to happen overnight. And so we continue to work with those suppliers to improve the remaining constrained chips and some of those are in software and control, some of them are in intelligent devices. And then, of course, because Lifecycle Services uses products from both of those business segments, there's some secondary effects there as well. But the view is optimistic, but all it takes is one chip and a product to keep from being able to ship it. And so it's not all clear yet. Yes, it's going to be uneven by different product lines. So, we do have product lines in our portfolio that have pretty much returned to pre-shortage, pre-pandemic levels in terms of lead times. The majority of our product offering is still at elevated lead times. We still see OEMs placing big orders for more months of coverage for their machine needs than they would like to, than they will when we return to more normal lead times there. So it's still a factor, but it's improving, and we expect it to improve through the year. Yes, thank you. Hey Andy. Yes, let me start with that one first, Andy. We're going to have far higher backlog at the end of fiscal 2023 than traditional levels. That's clear. We saw sequential growth in backlog from Q4 to Q1. And with the demand that we're seeing, then we expect backlog to continue to be high as we head into fiscal year 2024. Now in terms of customers' CapEx behavior, the industries that we've highlighted as needing to make, let's say, once in a generation changes in their capacity, that's continuing. And we do track announced CapEx investments across the verticals that are important to us, and we continue to see high levels of investment in EV and battery. Semiconductor isn't on quite the same ramp up of quarter-over-quarter growth of new announcements but it's at a very high level even as that moderates. And as we've talked about, we're seeing increasing share of wallet in those fabs. So that's good news. Food and beverage, we talked about some of the areas, particularly of new value that they are investing in, probably a split of both CapEx and OpEx when they are looking at cybersecurity and some of the information solutions that we're adding. And energy continues to be a positive area where we expect for the full year, oil and gas is going to be double-digit growth for us. Good morning, Jeff. Yes, this is going to make us stronger for the future. The additional redundancy, the qualification of additional components, the work to design basically new bills and material with less constrained components with better suppliers to ensure that that flow is more resilient, long term, that's going to be a net benefit to our overall supply chain. There is some overhead in terms of additional cost that's being directed towards those resiliency efforts, and that will wane over time. But currently, that does contribute to some of the additional costs that we're seeing. But we're already seeing the benefits. And I think mid and long term, that will also continue to be a real strength as we, like all our customers, are looking to increase their resiliency. Sure. So Jeff, you asked about the IRA and what specifically are we seeing there. A couple of thoughts come to mind with that. One, we've showcased the work that we're doing with First Solar, including some of their greenfields, which they've stated were helped along by IRA funding for renewable energy. And so we're proud of the relationship we've had for many years with First Solar. We're doing the controls and now the digital twins in their facilities. They would not have introduced as many greenfield projects without IRA funding. And so that's an example where it helped them, which helps us because they are a good partner. The second is some of the provisions in the IRA on U.S. manufacturing. When an automobile manufacturer builds a plant in the U.S., there is a higher probability that we're going to get large content because of our strong position here. And so that's also what's helping us as well. And again, it's the increased investment in the U.S. by the brand owners. But then when it comes to the U.S., for the reasons I talked about earlier and that you're well aware of we have an unmatched position. So for the second part of your question, semiconductor and what are we doing there? For a long time, our core strength has been in areas of facilities management and control systems. So that's controlling the temperature, the humidity, the cleanliness of the clean room environment. We've done that for a long time in Asia. And as more fabs are being built in the U.S., again, we're extending that capability and share of wallet here. It's also in clean room process tools. And with some of the tooling suppliers, we've enjoyed a good relationship for a very long time. And that's a combination of hardware as well as our project management and engineer-to-order expertise. More recently, cybersecurity has been a factor and has added millions of dollars of new business as we're helping harden these facilities to make them more resilient against cyber-attacks. And the wafer transport that we've talked about a couple of times, that independent cart technology that we talk a lot about in EV and other industries, is really valuable here as well. And we're starting to win big, multimillion dollar projects in several of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. And then the final one that I mentioned was a silicon carbide becomes a scale technology. We're starting to use it in our own products. We're seeing some logic-based automation there, and that's exciting because they are using a standard architecture rather than a lot of the custom PC-based control systems that have characterized that industry for a long time. So hopefully, that gets at the heart of those questions, Jeff. Yes. Hi, Josh. Yes, I think, there is a blend of things going on. First of all, there is the investment in new technologies that all of the players in the industry, like EV, have a real fear of missing out on. We've got the idea that they're going to take a pause based on the macroeconomic concerns and let their competitors build out their fleets and be far ahead of them in terms of their ability to turn out hundreds of thousands of vehicles a year, they just can't wait. And so they are having to power through a still dynamic economic environment. And of course, that's EV and battery. I would say it's also semiconductor as well, where they have to build this capacity. In general, we're seeing across a broader spectrum of verticals the idea that automation is going to help them be more resilient and is going to enable greater productivity from their workforce. So it's not so much about the direct substitution of automation for labor, it's making that labor more productive. And I think that's a general trend that we're seeing across other of our verticals, food and beverage, pharma, and so on. So we're seeing that. We're not tone-deaf to the concerns about the economy. And in terms of our own operations, when I talk about taking a conservative approach, we're watching that. We're prudently adding resources as needed to fuel new growth, but we're very aware of the macro. It's just not going to have as much of an effect on us in the current fiscal year because of a huge backlog that we have, and we're building backlog that's going to go well into 2024 and beyond. Yes. Josh, I wish I could construct an equation that would give you the percentages by vertical and give us our guide for us. But unfortunately, there's a huge amount of variability between the different industries. And of course, between greenfield, brownfield and so on, a lot of the brownfield-type investments are going to carry with it a higher percentage. So some of those are dedicated to the things that we offer in terms of automation and information management and the related services. The percentage spend for a new fab or a major new EV complex, it's going to be a small percentage of the total. And our job is to maximize the wins in our traditional value, but work really hard as we're doing in areas like semi and EV to add share of wallet, like we're doing with independent cart really in both of those as we're doing in software on the EV side and so on. So I hope that while that percentage of the total CapEx remains fairly low, it's high value, it's profitable and it's growing each year. Yes. Thanks Josh. Yes. Julian, oil and gas is where we expect a particularly strong ramp from mid-single digit to double-digit. We also see a little bit of that in related chemical industries, particularly the fine chemical applications that are really our sweet spot. Orders continued strong for oil and gas and other verticals in process. They continue, as I mentioned before to see some supply chain shortages that put a little bit of pressure on the shipments in the quarter. But we're comfortable and confident with the continued orders and with the really strong backlog that we'll see the double-digit growth for the full year. I should mention \u2013 I should just mention, since we're talking about process if you were at Automation Fair, you saw the new high availability Process IO. So it's not just the traditional value that we're providing, but the strength of some of our recent acquisitions and new product introduction. And as we release over the coming months that high availability IO, that's a major step change in our capabilities in our PlantPAx system. So that's something that had been a gap for a period of time, and we're very happy with the way that the IO has turned out and the endorsement by process customers. Yes. Hi Steve. Thank you. Yes, the orders were strong. We continue to give the book-to-bill specifically for lifecycle services, which was at 1.21. And overall, for the company, as we talked about orders and backlog being sequentially up, meaning, obviously, orders were in excess of the shipments for the quarter, it's across the segments and it's across the regions as we see that continued demand. And we will see continued high backlog levels even with the strong shipments and the increased guide, we'll see very strong backlog at the end of 2023 as we go into 2024. Yes. We haven't talked about it other than to say it's healthy sequential orders because we think the sequential information and the cancellation rates, which we also talked about being flat and remaining in low-single-digits, we think those are the most important factors going forward. And if I could just add to that, yes, we did have an additional price increase in December, so in this fiscal year. And apart from the announcements of specific price increases, we've talked over the last year of being more agile in terms of getting the recognition of the prices by changing our methodology with customers and with the channel. And I would just say that's proceeding smoothly and with our expectations in terms of being able to be more agile as future price increases are introduced. Yes. As we talked about the new cancellation policy on orders, that's more of a hygiene type of issue. We didn't expect it to affect order patterns, and that's exactly our experience is that it did not have a significant impact on order patterns. But we got it in, and I think it's a healthy part of our processes. Yes. Thanks Steve. Hey Brendan. Yes. So we've had a big focus on adding ARR. We've talked much more formally about it here in the last couple of years. And while it's still a relatively small part of our total business, I like starting each year with that recurring revenue. It gives you a reason for being constantly intimate with our customers and the whole land and expand motion is well understood to be a good source of ongoing value. We like our position in terms of having that, growing double-digits, and being able to complement it with the physical goods that we're shipping that are still being sold on a perpetual basis, a one-time PO. But over time, we expect to add additional software and services to our annual recurring revenue streams as well as hardware where that makes sense. One of the phenomenon is as we're in our second year of double-digit growth, because our overall business is growing so fast, the ARR as a percentage of the total is not increasing a huge amount, but it is more than keeping pace. And so we're happy with it. We're retooling our internal business processes to be able to take orders with a mix of hardware, software and services to make it easier and easier for customers and channel to be able to restack and expand the content in those subscriptions and so on. So we're happy with the progress there. We see some pull forward that was in Q1 that was more a factor from the price increase. But even without that, we had orders that would have contributed to strong sequential growth. So any pull forward would not have had much to do with the cancellation policy, but there would have been some pull forward in Q1 that would have been a factor of the price increase that we introduced then. We are also seeing, as I mentioned in Q1, strong project activity with multi-site and multiyear deals, and that was significant in Q1. Thanks Noah."

Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. [Operator Instruction] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations and Market Strategy. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead.\nAijana Zellner: Thank you, Julianne. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's fourth quarter fiscal 2024 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Christian Rothe, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include, and our call today will reference, non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. And with that, I'll hand it over to Blake.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Aijana and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'll make a couple of comments before we turn to our fourth quarter results. With the U.S. Federal Election Day now behind us, we're optimistic that the country will turn its focus to a smooth transition to newly elected leaders. We're pleased that policymakers recognize the essential role that U.S. manufacturing plays at the core of our economy. Rockwell is the clear leader in providing technology that helps U.S. manufacturers be more competitive, so we welcome policies that will benefit our most important market by spurring innovation, streamlining project approvals and leveling the playing field. Orders continued to be soft in Q4, but we had solid execution on several fronts. Customer service levels and conversion of new orders to shipments are back to pre-pandemic levels across all businesses. We are growing profitable software and digital services lines of business which help to partially mitigate the impact of excess product inventory in our channel. Annual recurring revenue grew double digits in the year and is now 10% of our total revenue. For comparison, ARR was about 4% of our revenue in 2018. We're seeing modest market share gains over the past few years based on U.S. market share reports, product specific studies and comparison to the automation businesses of our closest competitors. Our best results in fiscal year 2024 were in North America, our home market and China is now less than 5% of our revenue. We are broadening our cost savings activities and Christian Rothe, our new CFO has jumped into the effort with enthusiasm. He brings valuable new perspectives on additional opportunities. At the end of fiscal year 2024, we were able to accelerate our savings to realize about $110 million of cost reductions in the second half of the year, $10 million above the target we first discussed in May. As of the end Of October of 2024 our global headcount is down over 12% since Q2 of fiscal 2024. In the last call we talked about multiple additional cost down opportunities, including activities to reduce the price paid for purchase components and services as well as actions to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing plants. Despite the headwind of lower volume, we are still confident in our ability to save $250 million in fiscal year 2025 from the combination of all our productivity actions. We continue to see positive impact from pricing actions. These have been difficult times, but I'm impressed by the resilience and sense of urgency of our teams as we position ourselves to deliver market beating growth and profitability. Later on this call, Christian will cover our pricing, productivity and margin expansion actions for next year. Let's now turn to our Q4 results on Slide 3. Our Q4 orders were down low single digits sequentially compared to our expectations for low single digit improvement. Similar to last quarter, the rate of reduction of lingering excess inventory at our distributors and machine builders was gated by slower end user demand. Of note, we did see sequential orders growth in North America with Asia contributing the largest sequential decline. Going forward, we expect our Q1 orders to be flat sequentially. We expect our Q1 sales to be down high single digits from last quarter, primarily due to typical seasonality in our configure-to-order and solutions businesses and slower orders in Q4 of fiscal 2024. I'll talk more about our fiscal 2025 outlook later on the call. Despite weaker than expected orders, our Q4 organic sales came in largely in line with expectations. As I mentioned earlier, we quickly converted incoming product orders to shipments and lifecycle services capped off a year of improved performance with good execution in the quarter. Q4 sales for the company declined 21% versus prior year compared to 18% growth in Q4 of last year. The decline is due to the difficult year-over-year comparison, lingering channel destocking effects in our product businesses and slower end user demand.\nCUBIC: This quarter we secured a strategic win at NTT, a leading data center colo provider. Rockwell is helping this customer achieve significant footprint savings by leveraging CUBIC's modular, compact and switchgear agnostic custom design capabilities. In Software & Control, organic sales were down over 30% year-over-year. Within this segment, logic shipments were weaker due to slower end demand in product centric end markets. Despite the continuing volatility in product shipments, our PLC market share is slightly up helped by a geographic mix and continued innovation.\nLogix SIS: Other launches extend the differentiation of our software offering. Last quarter we launched our Vision AI Solutions to help customers improve their quality and yield. In general, software was our best performing area this year with good revenue growth across Fix, Plex and other FactoryTalk offerings. The newest FactoryTalk Design Studio release features a copilot which boosts automation system design productivity and is integrated in this cloud native application which is an industry first. You'll see many of these products at our automation fare in a few weeks. Lifecycle Services organic sales grew about 2% versus prior year book-to-bill in this segment was 0.9 and slightly below our historical average for Q4. We saw a couple of customer delays projects in our Sensia business this quarter. We continue to have a healthy pipeline of projects which include both traditional and energy transition applications and reflect a general shift towards autonomous operations to improve safety and operational performance. Energy end markets overall were over 15% of our total business in fiscal 2024. On the services side, we continue to increase customer penetration through managed services with a growing number of contracts generating recurring revenue. Total ARR for the company grew 16% in the quarter with double digit growth across our software and services offerings. Segment margin was over 20% and adjusted EPS was $2.47. Turning to Slide 4, to review key highlights of our Q4 industry segment performance, similar to our overall top line results in the quarter, our performance by industry reflects difficult year-over-year comparisons, with Q4 of last year being a record quarter of shipments. Sales in our discrete industries were impacted by continued declines in auto and semi, partially offset by growth in e-Commerce & Warehouse Automation. In Automotive, we saw another quarter of EV project delays as brand owners and tier suppliers wait for more policy certainty and an overall improvement in consumer spending. Despite this pause in EV, there's still activity and we continue to win business across traditional ICE and hybrid programs. Rockwell was selected by Ford Motor Company as the automation partner for their Louisville, Kentucky facility. Rockwell will be supplying a full portfolio of Logix controllers, drives, HMI and industrial components for the body and final assembly shops. There is also additional content for their next generation truck programs. Moving to Semiconductor, while the industry is dealing with oversupply and uncertainty around future stimulus support, we secured an important win with a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing to automate their R&D facilities here in the U.S. We also continue to gain traction with our production logistics offering from material transport. e-Commerce & Warehouse Automation sales increased 25% versus prior year. In addition to continued investments in warehouse upgrades by both e-commerce and traditional retail players, we see the benefits of data center investment, particularly in our CUBIC business. Turning to our Hybrid Industry, sales in this segment were impacted by double digit year-over-year declines in Food & Beverage and Life Sciences. In Food & Beverage, we continue to see muted capacity investments as end users are delaying projects and focusing on driving operational improvements across their existing facilities. With that said, we are working with leading Food & Beverage producers on their next greenfield plans. In the quarter we had an important win with Kikkoman, the largest soy sauce manufacturer in the world. In partnership with the engineering firm CRB, we are delivering Rockwell's portfolio of Plex MES software and scalable plant wide control, helping Kikkoman build their factory of the future here in Jefferson, Wisconsin. Within our Life Sciences vertical, we're seeing the investment in GLP-1 drugs as key pharma companies and their contract manufacturers aggressively add manufacturing capacity to support soaring consumer demand. Sales growth in our Process industries was impacted by difficult comps with over 25% growth in Q4 of last year for this industry segment. Within Oil & Gas, similar to last quarter, we saw project push outs in North America due to election uncertainty and potential policy changes given the impact they may have on funding of greenhouse gas related projects. Sensia did grow double digits in the quarter and continued to deliver improved profitability. In Mining customers are investing in the sustainability and safety of their operations. This quarter Rockwell was chosen by Syrate [ph] New Denmark and South Africa to upgrade their environmental monitoring system from a competitive software offering to ensure effective monitoring of environmental conditions and respond to potential hazards. Let's turn to Slide 5 and our Q4 organic regional sales. In general, sales were down sharply year-over-year due to tough comparisons and the lingering impact of destocking. Orders were up sharply year-over-year due to the easy comparison with Q4 fiscal year 2023. Sequentially orders were down low single digits and shipments were flattish. The Americas, our home market, continued to be our best performing region. As I mentioned, orders were up sequentially in North America. While we are happy with our strong presence in the Americas, we continue to expand our share of wallet with European machine builders as they serve their end users around the world. In the quarter, we won an important project with Gaia in India. Gaia is one of the world's largest system suppliers for the food, beverage and pharmaceutical sectors. The Gaia portfolio includes machinery and plants, as well as advanced process technology, components and comprehensive services. The end user will implement state-of-the-art technologies to ensure efficient water usage and replenishment. Let's move to Slide 6 for key highlights of fiscal 2024. We finished the year with a 9% year-over-year decline in reported sales. Sales from our ClearPath and Verve acquisitions contributed about a point of growth as we expand our customer value in the production, logistics and cyber security spaces. Total ARR grew 16% with strong performance across our recurring software and services portfolio and is now over 10% of our total business. The 200 basis point decrease in our segment margin on a high single digit year-over-year sales decline would have been worse without our more diverse business mix, and the significant cost reduction actions we took earlier this year to align our cost structure with the current business environment. These actions also position us for expanded margins as markets recover. 60% free cash flow conversion was in line with our prior forecast. Let's now move to Slide 7 to review our fiscal 2025 outlook. Given the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and continued project delays across a number of our end markets, we're projecting sales growth in the range of positive 2% to negative 4%. After a sequential decline in Q1 shipments, primarily due to typical seasonality, we expect gradual sequential improvement in our top line growth through the balance of fiscal year 2025. Christian will cover the calendarization of our guidance in more detail later on this call. We expect our annual recurring revenue to grow about 10%. Segment margin is projected to be down slightly versus prior year and adjusted EPS is expected to be $9.20 at the midpoint. We expect free cash flow conversion to return to 100% in fiscal year 2025. I'll now turn it over to Christian to provide more detail on our Q4 and full year performance and financial outlook for fiscal 2025. Christian?\nChristian Rothe: Thank you, Blake and good morning everyone. I'm excited to be here this morning and look forward to working with you all over the coming quarters and years. I'll start on slide 8, fourth quarter key financial information. Fourth quarter reported sales were down 21% versus prior year. The positive impact of acquisitions and the negative impact of currency roughly offset each other in the quarter. About two points of our organic growth came from price. Segment operating margin was 20.1% compared to 22.3% a year ago. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower sales volume and unfavorable mix partially offset by our cost reduction actions and no incentive compensation. Adjusted EPS of $2.47 was above our expectations primarily due to price and one-time items. Those one-time items included $22 million benefit from an adjustment to an earn-out accrual tied to achievement of the sellers revenue targets on our ClearPath acquisition. Adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 14.9% below the prior year rate of 17% and about 4 points below our expectations for the quarter. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later Slide. Free cash flow of $367 million was $409 million lower than the prior year, primarily due to lower pretax income. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased approximately 450,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $118 million. On September 30th we had $1.3 billion remaining under our repurchase authorizations. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview for our three operating segments. Intelligent Devices margin of 20.6% decreased 70 basis points year-over-year due to lower sales volume and unfavorable mix. If you exclude the benefit from the ClearPath earn-out adjustment I mentioned earlier, segment margin in Intelligent Devices was 18.3%. Operationally this was about a point below our expectations as better than expected price cost was more than offset by lower volume and other costs including the impact of currency. Purely focusing on decremental conversion after adjusting for the earn-out, the segment had decrementals in the mid-30s year-over-year in the fourth quarter which reflects strong execution on cost out programs against a 20% organic sales decline. Software & Control margin of 22.3% decreased about 1,100 basis points year-over-year due to lower sales volume which was partially offset by cost reduction actions and no incentive compensation. Margins in this segment were below our expectations mainly due to lower shipments of Logix controllers. Revenue from the software portion of Software & Control held up nicely year-over-year. The 39% sales decline in Software & Control was driven by the hardware portion of the business against the historically high shipments in Q4 of the prior year. The typically high decrementals for Software & Control were mitigated somewhat by our cost out actions. Lifecycle Services margin of 17.4% increased 890 basis points year-over-year and was slightly above our expectations. The higher year-over-year segment margin lifecycle was driven by no incentive compensation, strong project execution and Sensia margin improvement. As Blake said, this business performed well throughout fiscal 2024 and the incrementals reflect that. The next Slide 10 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q4 fiscal 2023 to Q4 fiscal 2024. Core performance was down $2.40 on a 21% organic sales decrease with unfavorable segment and product mix driving an outsized flow through. As Blake mentioned, cost reduction actions provided a $70 million benefit in the quarter exceeding our expectations and were a $0.50 tailwind. Incentive compensation was a $0.55 tailwind. This year-over-year delta reflects no bonus payout this year versus an above target payout last year. ClearPath earn-out benefit was $0.20. Year-over-year impact from currency and acquisitions were a $0.05 headwind each whereas tax was a $0.05 tailwind. Shares, interest and other items taken together were a tailwind of $0.03. I want to pause here to briefly discuss the sequential performance for Rockwell from Q3 to Q4. Although it's not in the slide, I think it's informative to discuss the progression, particularly when we later discuss the fiscal 2025 guide. Negative mix was the largest contributor to our decremental sequentially. While reported company wide sales were down $15 million, declines in products in both Intelligent Devices and Software & Control including Logix were more than double that amount. On the other hand, we saw growth in Lifecycle Services and our configure-to-order products which have less favorable margin profile. Further, as mentioned in our Q3 call, the Lifecycle Services segment had some high margin projects ship in Q3 that did not recur in Q4. This negative impact of both volume and mix drove high sequential decremental margins. Sequential currency and pension headwinds were offset by the earn-out adjustment. Moving on, Slide 11 provides key financial information for the full fiscal year 2024. Reported sales declined 9% to $8.3 billion including 1 point of growth coming from acquisitions. Currency was neutral. Organic sales were down 10%. Full year segment margin of 19.3% decreased 200 basis points from last year. The decrease was due to lower sales and again an unfavorable mix that skewed heavily toward products partially offset by no incentive compensation as well as the benefits from cost reduction actions and one-time items including the earn out adjustment. Adjusted EPS was down 20%. A detailed year-over-year adjusted EPS block can be found in the Appendix for your reference Free cash flow conversion was in line with the updated expectations we shared last quarter at about 60% in fiscal 2024. Free cash flow decreased $575 million from fiscal 2023. The decrease in free cash flow was driven by lower pretax income. Inventory and receivables were a source of cash in the fourth quarter as we reduced our balances in line with end demand. Return on Invested capital was 15.2% for fiscal year 2024 and 570 basis points than the prior year, primarily driven by lower income. For the year, we deployed about $1.2 billion of capital toward dividends and share repurchases and made inorganic investments of $750 million at the beginning of the fiscal year for ClearPath and Verve. Our capital structure and liquidity remained strong. Let's now move on to the next Slide 12 to discuss guidance for fiscal 2025. We expect reported sales in a range from negative 4% to positive 2% or slightly below $8.2 billion at the midpoint with no impact from currency or acquisitions. At the midpoint of our sales guidance, which is negative 1%, we expect both Intelligent Devices and Software & Control to be down low single digits and Lifecycle Services to be up low single digits year-over-year. We expect price to contribute about a point of growth for the year and price cost to be favorable. Segment margin is expected to be just under 19% at the midpoint, down about 40 basis points from fiscal year 2024. As Blake mentioned, we continue to expect $250 million in year-over-year benefit from our productivity and margin expansion projects in fiscal year 2025. We look forward to covering more on our productivity and operational excellence journey with you at our upcoming Investor Day in Anaheim. We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. This is about 2 percentage points higher than fiscal 2024, which benefited from some discrete events that will not recur. Our adjusted EPS guidance ranges $8.60 to $9.80 with $9.20 at the midpoint. We expect full year fiscal 2025 free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. Blake mentioned earlier that we expect first quarter sales to be down high single digits sequentially. From a margin standpoint, we expect our Q1 margins to be in the low to mid-teens. Although we don't give quarterly guidance, we thought it would be helpful to give some additional color on how we expect the first quarter to shape up. Intelligent Devices sales are expected to be down low teens sequentially, reflecting soft product demand and a seasonal low in configure to order products. Against this tough volume backdrop, Intelligent Devices will have compensation headwinds and the non-recurrence of the earn out adjustment. As a result, we expect Intelligent Devices segment margins to be in the low teens. Software & Control margin is expected to be in the low 20s on flat sequential sales growth. Lifecycle Services typically has a seasonal low in the first quarter and sales are expected to be down low single digits sequentially. We expect compensation headwinds and the volume impact to drive segment margins in Lifecycle to the low teens. As Blake mentioned, we expect gradual sequential improvement in our sales through the rest of the year. We also expect a corresponding increase in our segment margins. Let's turn to Slide 13 for our adjusted EPS walk for the full year. Our core is expected to be negative $0.20 for the year with more normalized conversion on the 1% sales decline at the midpoint of our guide. Importantly, included in our core is R&D spending, the lifeblood of our future growth, which we continue to target at about 6% of sales. Non-R&D investments planned for fiscal 2025 are expected to be a $0.25 headwind. These investments are structural in nature to position us for future growth. They include expansion of our CUBIC footprint to continue to capture the ongoing data center tailwind, especially in the U.S., our new Rockwell facility in India and IT investments that will provide differentiated performance both inside and outside of Rockwell's walls. Continuing on to the waterfall, our productivity actions are expected to increase EPS by $1.85 reflecting the targeted $250 million cost out savings. Nearly offsetting those savings are compensation and inflation headwinds next year which are expected to decrease EPS by $1.40 at the midpoint of guide. Adjustments to the ClearPath earn-out in Q2 and Q4 of fiscal 2024 result in a $0.25 headwind in fiscal 2025. We expect tax to be a $0.20 headwind. Shares, interest expense and other items taken together are expected to be a $0.06 headwind. To break down the guide another way, our adjusted EPs in fiscal 2024 included about $0.25 of benefit from earn-out adjustments that added about 35 basis points to our segment margins for the year. Our guide of fiscal 2025 segment margins of just under 19% reflects essentially flat segment margins on this adjusted basis year-over-year. The headwinds of a 1% sales decline at the midpoint of our guide, as well as compensation and investment headwinds are expected to be offset at the segment level by our cost out programs. A few additional Comments on Fiscal 2025 guidance for your models, corporate and other expenses is expected to be around $130 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2025 is expected to be about $145 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 113.1 million shares and we are targeting $300 million of share repurchases during the year. With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Christian. Despite project delays tied to policy uncertainty and the U.S. election, we won new capacity projects in the U.S. across a variety of verticals in the quarter and throughout the year. We saw a sequential ramp in these wins throughout the year with Q4 being the best quarter. Projects came from a diverse set of end markets including renewable energy, tire, oil and gas, EV and semiconductor. The funnel of these mega projects is robust and we expect an increase in these orders during fiscal year 2025. Fiscal year 2025 will be a particularly strong year for new product introductions, including both hardware and software. We look forward to showcasing this innovation for customers during Automation Fair in two weeks and for you at our Investor Day during the show. Acquisitions made a year ago are expected to contribute about a point of organic growth in fiscal year 2025. We do not anticipate major new acquisitions in the year. We have an unmatched portfolio that combines traditional sources of value with new ways to win. As we've said, we're now concentrating on integrating what we built and bought to drive simplification for our customers, expanded margins for investors, and focus for our employees. Our people remain the heart of our success and I thank them for their dedication and resilience. My leadership team and I look forward to working shoulder to shoulder with our employees and partners around the world during the coming year as we tune our operations add new innovation to our portfolio and win at customers. Aijana will now begin the Q&A session.\nAijana Zellner: Thanks, Blake. [Operator Instructions] Julianne, let's take our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nScott Davis: Hey, good morning, Blake and Christian, Aijana.\nBlake Moret: Hey, good morning.\nScott Davis: Blake, you implied that maybe the election caused some noise. Do you see a restock happening imminently is that something that seems possible?\nBlake Moret: We're really not counting -- Scott, we're really not counting on anything at the beginning of the year, particularly in Q1. As we talked about before, we're nearing the end of the drain of excess stock at distributors and machine builders. Some machine builders and distributors are already back to that equilibrium point, but we're just not counting on some rapid acceleration for them to put additional inventory back on their shelf.\nScott Davis: And just to follow up on that theme, the last time we had tariffs come in, what were the customer responses? Were they more likely to pre-buy and kind of buildup in particular distributors, build up inventory? Were they more -- was there a change in behaviors around that? And certainly there may be some concerns around tariffs, so I'm just kind of curious to see what you guys saw last time and how that may inform this time.\nBlake Moret: We really didn't see customer behavior change a lot with the tariffs, I'll tell you that. That's an area that I'm proud of the agility that we showed as the tariffs came through to get ahead of that to ensure a positive price cost as things were coming in. And so I'm very confident should we see additional tariffs, we'll be able to reflect that in our pricing to customers. But unlike what occasionally will happen with regular price increases, where you see a little bit of purchases brought forward, we really didn't see that with respect to the tariffs, obviously, there's a lot of expectation that continues as investment increases in the U.S. to complement labor with technology. And of course, that's right down our sweet spot.\nScott Davis: Yes, makes sense. Okay, thank you. Best of luck this year, guys. We'll see you in a few weeks.\nBlake Moret: Yes, thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nBlake Moret: Hey, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Blake, maybe just trying to flesh out 2025 a little bit more. When you look at 2025, do you think we're any closer to a bottom in discrete? I know you mentioned some incremental CapEx delays, but is there any kind of visibility that's helping you? Let's call it talk about relative stability in hybrid and process markets in 2025 given the forecast of down low, single digits and flat respectively.\nBlake Moret: Yes. So in let's start with Hybrid, Food & Beverage, we're still not seeing a lot of activity of people pulling the trigger on greenfield investment, although we're working with them and the associated EPCs on planning for expansion projects. And we're continuing to get business through digital services modernizations and things like that with their brownfield footprint. In Life Sciences, we do think that we may be coming off a little bit of a bottom with respect to Life Sciences. And we've talked about the optimism around GLP-1 capacity that we're engaged with and that we expect to continue in that area. In discrete the biggest component of discrete is Automotive. We talked about a minute ago the win at Ford. So customers are still investing, but it's not picked up to a point where we can sound the all clear let's say. We do expect the SAR count to increase in fiscal 2025. EV as a percentage of vehicles sold in the U.S. is expected to go up a little above 10%. It's obviously at a much slower pace than we all envisioned a couple of years ago. And then another element of discrete is e-Commerce and Warehouse Automation. That's also where our data center activity is. That was a bright spot this year for us and we expect that to continue. There's a lot of activity there, not only among the hyperscalers, but also among the other retailers who are looking to modernize and make their operations more efficient. Semiconductor a little bit more mixed. Still expect that to recover. We talked about some activity there, but we're not expecting that to be a big contributor in the year.\nAndy Kaplowitz: It's helpful. And then Blake, just kind of fleshing out the 2025 guidance or maybe this for Christian, orders down, most of them in Q4. You talked about flat in Q1. I guess, that puts you probably in the sevens in terms of run rate and sales. So maybe how much lift do you get in orders if destocking were to just end and do you need orders to start picking up in Q2 to sort of make that midpoint of your guide?\nBlake Moret: We're really looking at very gradual sequential growth in orders after Q1. That's what we're expecting triangulating from a variety of points, looking at the different industries. We also look at life cycle with its higher exposure to process, which continues to invest and the relevance of backlog that they have in that segment, contributing positive growth in the year. So we feel comfortable with that. And then with the order progression that I just described being the biggest impact, biggest influence on Software & Control and Intelligent Devices through the year.\nAndy Kaplowitz: I appreciate it. Look forward to seeing in a couple weeks.\nBlake Moret: Yes, see you soon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrew Obin: Yes, good morning.\nBlake Moret: Hey Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Just, I'm going to go back to sort of trying to figure out where things bottom. So as you look at your funnel and then obviously funnel becomes orders and then orders become shipments. So just trying to understand is the sort of this funnel converting into orders is just budgeting at year end. And so we effectively need budgets to be set for calendar 2025. And that's what we're going to see orders. And then once you get an order, what do you think, because not just for you, I know that you guys can probably ship your stuff within one to two weeks, but as you put the product together, what's the right way of thinking from order converting into shipment that you book? Is it three months? Is it six months? If you could just outline this timeline if and when things actually start inflecting? Thank you.\nBlake Moret: Sure. So, Andrew, let me describe a little bit of the overall process, and if I missed something, then ask me to touch that up. The funnel is tracked probably a little bit differently for pure products that go into MRO versus the big greenfield projects that we look at that we described last year in terms of the typical calendarization of like a big EV project, for instance. And of course, we have both in our business. We track intensely the project work, in some cases a year or two before orders are left there with CapEx across the different industries. And that's where our Lighthouse project group has really shown this year. And as I said, we expect even more activity in the coming year. That funnel looks good and certainly supports the guide with respect to Lifecycle Services. We have a good funnel in ClearPath, for instance, cubic and so on. But between the time that something comes out of the funnel and is won and ordered and shipped that could be months or in some cases a year or more depending on the amount of engineering in that project. When it comes to the products in that funnel, when those come out as an order to us, as you said, we're back to turning those around at a very high rate. The majority of those get serviced within a period of days off our distributor shelf. But even when we have to build it, we can rely on the safety stock that we built up, built back up during the year or building in the plants that's converting at a very high rate. So, I think to your question, from time to get an order to the shipment, what's the overall time? It literally is a period of weeks for those products, a little bit longer for the configure-to-order products that we have in intelligent devices. And again you get into the months. I think average lead time in Lifecycle Services is probably about five or six months. But it certainly varies between digital services and fully engineered systems. So hopefully that touches on some of what you were looking for.\nAndrew Obin: Yes, no, absolutely. Thanks so much. And then just and I apologize if you have sort of talked about it but, you were sort of machine builders in Europe was a pinch point. I think one of your competitors sort of has come out and said that that is being pushed out three to six months. What is happening with machine builders in Europe, just a little bit more granular view there? Thank you.\nBlake Moret: Yes, well let me, let me start with a subjective comment and that is I'm seeing a lot of machine builders from Europe in our facility now and we'll see a lot of them at Automation Fair in a couple of weeks. The PACK EXPO show down in Chicago, was close enough to where we're seeing a lot of those machine builders come up and talk to us about their plans going forward, super encouraging. These are big names and they're already decent sized customers, but with lots of opportunities to grow share of their spend. Given that a lot of their end users are investing in the U.S. and they want to be working with the U.S. leader, that's fact. We're definitely hearing that directly from those machine builders and you'll hear from some more of them at Automation Fair as well. In fiscal year 2025, coming off of a year where the overstock condition at European machine builders contributed to big declines, we expect Europe to be decent performing after the Americas. So Americas will be the best performing region in the world in 2025, followed by Europe, followed by Asia, as those overstock conditions completely dissipate and they get back to normal order patterns.\nAndrew Obin: Thanks so much, I really appreciate it.\nBlake Moret: Yes, thanks Andrew.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nNigel Coe: Oh, thanks. Good morning everyone. Hey, good morning. Thanks for the 1Q color and all the additional guidance points. So Christian, I just want to make sure that we've got message on 1Q. We're sort of getting, just to map it back to the full year guide, down a 6% to 7% type organic year-over-year for 1Q. And it's just based on the, I don't know, based on the margin it seems like maybe a bit more pressure perhaps on EPS, so maybe down to like $1.80 or so. Would that be sort of consistent with your thinking?\nChristian Rothe: Yes. So just to -- hi Nigel. To frame it a little bit when we talk about the sequential side of it for kind of the overall organization we have, if we bridge from Q4 into Q1, we've got headwinds, of course the earn out adjustment is not going to recur. We've got headwinds from the perspective of the compensation inflationary side and then on top of that, of course, there's the volume reduction. All of which are going to contribute to going to contribute to some real decrementals as we go into Q1. So you mentioned a number on the EPS. We're not going to actually get into real detail on exactly what that number is, but it will be significantly below $2.\nNigel Coe: Okay, that's helpful. And then just based on the normal, I mean normal quote unquote normal sequential through the year, it seems like 2Q would be down in the similar level year-over-year and then you start getting the real benefit from the easy comps in the back half of the year. But I do struggle to understand what gets us to plus 2% given the start of the year. So just to be curious what sort of assumptions you're making at that plus two and maybe just frame it in terms of what you'd expect to see in the order numbers.\nBlake Moret: Yes, so that would. So, the plus 2% would be a little bit better sequential improvement, either a little bit more pronounced ramp up or a little bit earlier development of the recovery in the end markets that would flip intelligent devices and Software & Control products to positive shipments for the year. So, if you get a little bit higher growth than expected earlier in the year and we continue to build sequentially off of that, that's where you would see the pickup, the lifecycle services, the longer lead time items. Again, given the exposure to process markets and the amount in backlog, I don't see that changing as dramatically. It's really going to be the products that will be the swing votes in this.\nNigel Coe: Okay, thanks Blake. See you in two weeks.\nBlake Moret: Yes, see you soon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Snyder from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. I wanted to talk about America's market and order trends. So I think you guys said that those were up low single digits sequentially or just up sequentially, so any color on maybe the magnitude of increase? And when you guys talk about orders flat sequentially into Q1 on seasonality, is the expectation that Americas continues to get better and then just more broadly on America, anything you could comment around the competitive environment and specifically how you think the company is doing on share of new wins and new awards? Thank you.\nBlake Moret: Sure. Yes, as we said, Americas was the best performing region in 2024 and we expect in 2025 it continued to be the best performing region. We obviously have by far the largest share in the Americas. We've got the best channel; we've got the largest installed base and the deepest relationship. So it's pretty good hand in that case. And we're seeing, as I mentioned before, modest share gains. Obviously our competitors are all interested in the U.S. and expanding that footprint. But we're attacking it with the same sense of urgency and recognizing that we have to take the battle to machine builders and engineering firms around the world as well as continuing to provide, unmatched, very differentiated support for the users here as well, releasing new products, it's the whole equations and it's all hands on deck for that. In terms of the sequentials, I did mention that we saw sequential improvement in orders in Q4 in North America. And we haven't characterized just where we see the sequentials, through the year by region and by products or solutions. But again, we expect Americas to be the best. And I did say that we expect in the so called mega projects that we expect more orders to come from that activity in 2025 than we saw in 2024. And that will become a more and more significant number, as we finally get past the overstock effects of products in the channel.\nChris Snyder: I appreciate that. And then may be just following up on that American manufacturing CapEx investment, which is obviously tilting much more towards electronic components like chips and even bigger electrical equipment, maybe things like transformers. So as the CapEx shifts into different end markets, is there anything that investors should be aware of on just the content? Is the content on those products not just for you, but just for the automation industry? Maybe lower than more traditional verticals like, like Food & Beverage and then just the fact that some of these verticals are a bit new to the United States, how is Rockwell positioned to compete on those? Thank you.\nBlake Moret: Yes, Chris, great question. The opportunities we're tracking and literally there are thousands of projects that we're looking at and then getting laser focused on the, the top of the funnel where we have the clearest line of sight and they're getting ready to make decisions. If you look at the vertical industries represented by that funnel, it split roughly evenly between the verticals that we don't have as much penetration in that we haven't talked as much about historically. Things like semiconductor balanced by industries that we have great share in, we've talked about forever. We have, extremely high readiness to serve, like Food & Beverage, like Automotive, like Life Sciences. So we went through and characterized that entire basket of projects and it split roughly equal. And each side of that represents hundreds of billions of dollars of CapEx, and very substantial amounts of opportunity for us. And as I've said before, I think we're still in the reasonably early innings of those being awarded. So you're seeing awards for things like data centers for projects now. And while we have some exposure in data centers, it's obviously not the bulk of our business people are placing orders for very long lead time items. I think transformers in some cases are still out two years and so on and we'll see some content from that. But I think the biggest amount of those projects is still to come over, over the next few years.\nChris Snyder: Thank you.\nBlake Moret: Yes, thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. May be one question for you, Blake just thinking back to the Investor Day a year ago. So you talked about that sort of mid-to-high single digit organic sales CAGR entitlement. When we take 2024 in the guide for 2025, you're running at a sort of negative mid-single digit CAGR. So just trying to understand for you to sort of get the nose up and move back towards the mid to high positive growth, how much more do you need to put in in terms of reinvestment? Because I understand short-term you're sort of cutting spending and headcount because of the near term top line. But are you confident you can get back to that mid-single digit plus growth trend without sort of heavier investment taking place in the next couple of years?\nBlake Moret: Yes, thanks for the question, Julian. So in terms of the investment, we've taken a lot of care even through the last tough year to preserve spending in areas like customer facing resources as well as R&D for new product introductions and you'll see the continuing increased pace of that at Automation Fair in a couple of weeks, across our portfolio, Software & Control, Intelligent Devices, New Digital Services. I'm very proud of the way that we're getting these new products to market. And in fact in Software & Control, R&D as a percentage of sales is actually double digits. So we continue to preserve that going forward. I think that as we look at getting back to those growth rates, let me also say that after we get past the reset, the very high growth in 2023 17%, top line growth, obviously the decline last year and then the guide for this year, we still hold, and we'll talk more about this in a couple weeks, but we still hold to that framework both in terms of top line as well as margin expectations. And so, while we've made some cuts that are to align the cost structure of the business with current business conditions and incoming orders, some of what we're doing is structural for that long-term as well. We talked about the structural capacity investments that we're making. I just mentioned the continued investment in R&D. So I don't see a sharp snap back because we've been pretty surgical about the cuts that we've made to make sure that we're not cutting the lifeline to future acceleration back to the growth that we talked about at Investor Day last year.\nJulian Mitchell: That's very helpful. Thanks, Blake. And maybe just a shorter term second question for the 2025 guidance. So just on the segment margin point, it's 19% for the year, I just wanted to check, was that the low to mid-teens margin comment for Q1? Was that a segment margin comment? And so you sort of and off that Q1 margin starting point, do we assume you sort of take the margin up 200 or 300 basis points sequentially each quarter to get to 19% for the year? Is that the right framework? And maybe in that context, Christian, just to clarify, I know you don't want to talk quarterly earnings, but have a different way maybe first half, let's say, I think first half is often 45% of EPS in recent years. Is it maybe sort of 40% or so this year?\nChristian Rothe: Yes, Julian, thanks for the question. So as we think about that sequential as we go through the year, it should continue to improve. That was segment margins that we talked about in the first quarter. So yes, that low to mid-teens number that we, that I discussed was about the segment margin side. And yes, we do expect that that should ramp as the year goes on. In order to get to that 19%. I'm not really going to talk too much about first half, second half, but I do understand the math that you're doing there.\nJulian Mitchell: Great, thank you.\nChristian Rothe: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJoseph O'Dea: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Hi. I wanted to start on intelligent devices and the outlook for the first quarter. We've actually seen revenue on a quarterly trend in 2024 in a pretty stable range and it looks like what you're outlining is that sequentially from 4Q to 1Q would be down like $120 million. So much larger than what we've seen over the course of 2024 swings. Can you just kind of elaborate on what you're seeing there, destock end market regions, just to understand the drivers of that, step down a little more?\nChristian Rothe: Yes, so that step down, if you think about the fact that as we were going through the sequentials in 2024, each quarter there was some shipment of backlog that was happening. So the shipments were outstripping the incoming order rate during that period of time and on top of that, we do have some seasonal lows that are happening in the first quarter. So that's, that's a headwind for us in the first quarter and the configured order business is going to be off somewhat well in the first quarter.\nJoseph O'Dea: Got it. That's helpful. And then just in terms of any color around kind of end markets versus channel effects, when we think about inventory management over the course of 2024 in the channel, I think when we look at the combination of intelligent devices and Software & Control revenue down roughly $1 billion year-over-year. Just high level and any context on kind of end market versus destock contributions to that? Can we think about it as roughly a third of it could have been channel management versus end market trends? Anything there would be helpful.\nBlake Moret: Yes, I don't know that I can quantify the relative split because they're interrelated because the velocity of your destock is dependent on end user demand pulling it out of the channel. But the first part of last year of 2024, the effects of just that overstock were more pronounced. The underlying end user to market, end user demand was actually positive, we think. And then towards the end of the year, as we talked about in the last couple of calls, some weakening spread in those end demands and we're at a point where I think it's really most informative to talk about the end user demand. Again, they're linked. There's a little bit of stock left in the channel but it goes as end user demand goes. And so that's really going to be the biggest item as we look at the development in the year. The biggest impact of that will be on the product centric vertical. So think about Automotive where most of our business is done through products going through distributors and some machine builders. Food & Beverage, where packaging is actually, a very large percentage of the total business going into Food & Beverage and that's a product type go to market in those cases. So that's where you see the most of it as opposed to for instance in Oil & Gas or Life Sciences where you have a higher percentage that comes from Digital Services & Engineered Solutions.\nJoseph O'Dea: I appreciate the color. Thank you.\nBlake Moret: Yes, thanks Joe.\nAijana Zellner: Julianne, we'll take one more question.\nOperator: Certainly our last question today will come from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nNoah Kaye: Yes, thanks. Just a clarification on the guide. You called out some of the non-R&D investments but the nature of those sounded more like facility expansions. So just give us a bit more color on these investments and why they're OpEx versus CapEx?\nBlake Moret: Yes, it's a mix and in some of these there's a mix of OpEx and CapEx as you said. Some of it is facilities expanding cubic to be able to manage the really strong growth in the data center portion of your business. We do have a new facility in India that's providing some additional resilience in the Asian region for us and then digital infrastructure within IT, as we make sure that for internal productivity as well as external productivity with our partners we've got a business system and digital services that is world-class. So those are some of the investments that we're making. We talked about them on the waterfall because of the OpEx portion but there's a little bit of CapEx for those as well.\nNoah Kaye: That's helpful. Thanks Blake. See you in a couple weeks.\nBlake Moret: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to Ms. Zellner for closing remarks.\nAijana Zellner: Thank you for joining us today. That concludes today's conference call.\nOperator: At this time you may disconnect. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Blake Moret",
            "content": "Thanks, Aijana and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'll make a couple of comments before we turn to our fourth quarter results. With the U.S. Federal Election Day now behind us, we're optimistic that the country will turn its focus to a smooth transition to newly elected leaders. We're pleased that policymakers recognize the essential role that U.S. manufacturing plays at the core of our economy. Rockwell is the clear leader in providing technology that helps U.S. manufacturers be more competitive, so we welcome policies that will benefit our most important market by spurring innovation, streamlining project approvals and leveling the playing field. Orders continued to be soft in Q4, but we had solid execution on several fronts. Customer service levels and conversion of new orders to shipments are back to pre-pandemic levels across all businesses. We are growing profitable software and digital services lines of business which help to partially mitigate the impact of excess product inventory in our channel. Annual recurring revenue grew double digits in the year and is now 10% of our total revenue. For comparison, ARR was about 4% of our revenue in 2018. We're seeing modest market share gains over the past few years based on U.S. market share reports, product specific studies and comparison to the automation businesses of our closest competitors. Our best results in fiscal year 2024 were in North America, our home market and China is now less than 5% of our revenue. We are broadening our cost savings activities and Christian Rothe, our new CFO has jumped into the effort with enthusiasm. He brings valuable new perspectives on additional opportunities. At the end of fiscal year 2024, we were able to accelerate our savings to realize about $110 million of cost reductions in the second half of the year, $10 million above the target we first discussed in May. As of the end Of October of 2024 our global headcount is down over 12% since Q2 of fiscal 2024. In the last call we talked about multiple additional cost down opportunities, including activities to reduce the price paid for purchase components and services as well as actions to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing plants. Despite the headwind of lower volume, we are still confident in our ability to save $250 million in fiscal year 2025 from the combination of all our productivity actions. We continue to see positive impact from pricing actions. These have been difficult times, but I'm impressed by the resilience and sense of urgency of our teams as we position ourselves to deliver market beating growth and profitability. Later on this call, Christian will cover our pricing, productivity and margin expansion actions for next year. Let's now turn to our Q4 results on Slide 3. Our Q4 orders were down low single digits sequentially compared to our expectations for low single digit improvement. Similar to last quarter, the rate of reduction of lingering excess inventory at our distributors and machine builders was gated by slower end user demand. Of note, we did see sequential orders growth in North America with Asia contributing the largest sequential decline. Going forward, we expect our Q1 orders to be flat sequentially. We expect our Q1 sales to be down high single digits from last quarter, primarily due to typical seasonality in our configure-to-order and solutions businesses and slower orders in Q4 of fiscal 2024. I'll talk more about our fiscal 2025 outlook later on the call. Despite weaker than expected orders, our Q4 organic sales came in largely in line with expectations. As I mentioned earlier, we quickly converted incoming product orders to shipments and lifecycle services capped off a year of improved performance with good execution in the quarter. Q4 sales for the company declined 21% versus prior year compared to 18% growth in Q4 of last year. The decline is due to the difficult year-over-year comparison, lingering channel destocking effects in our product businesses and slower end user demand. Thanks, Christian. Despite project delays tied to policy uncertainty and the U.S. election, we won new capacity projects in the U.S. across a variety of verticals in the quarter and throughout the year. We saw a sequential ramp in these wins throughout the year with Q4 being the best quarter. Projects came from a diverse set of end markets including renewable energy, tire, oil and gas, EV and semiconductor. The funnel of these mega projects is robust and we expect an increase in these orders during fiscal year 2025. Fiscal year 2025 will be a particularly strong year for new product introductions, including both hardware and software. We look forward to showcasing this innovation for customers during Automation Fair in two weeks and for you at our Investor Day during the show. Acquisitions made a year ago are expected to contribute about a point of organic growth in fiscal year 2025. We do not anticipate major new acquisitions in the year. We have an unmatched portfolio that combines traditional sources of value with new ways to win. As we've said, we're now concentrating on integrating what we built and bought to drive simplification for our customers, expanded margins for investors, and focus for our employees. Our people remain the heart of our success and I thank them for their dedication and resilience. My leadership team and I look forward to working shoulder to shoulder with our employees and partners around the world during the coming year as we tune our operations add new innovation to our portfolio and win at customers. Aijana will now begin the Q&A session. Hey, good morning. We're really not counting -- Scott, we're really not counting on anything at the beginning of the year, particularly in Q1. As we talked about before, we're nearing the end of the drain of excess stock at distributors and machine builders. Some machine builders and distributors are already back to that equilibrium point, but we're just not counting on some rapid acceleration for them to put additional inventory back on their shelf. We really didn't see customer behavior change a lot with the tariffs, I'll tell you that. That's an area that I'm proud of the agility that we showed as the tariffs came through to get ahead of that to ensure a positive price cost as things were coming in. And so I'm very confident should we see additional tariffs, we'll be able to reflect that in our pricing to customers. But unlike what occasionally will happen with regular price increases, where you see a little bit of purchases brought forward, we really didn't see that with respect to the tariffs, obviously, there's a lot of expectation that continues as investment increases in the U.S. to complement labor with technology. And of course, that's right down our sweet spot. Yes, thanks, Scott. Hey, Andy. Yes. So in let's start with Hybrid, Food & Beverage, we're still not seeing a lot of activity of people pulling the trigger on greenfield investment, although we're working with them and the associated EPCs on planning for expansion projects. And we're continuing to get business through digital services modernizations and things like that with their brownfield footprint. In Life Sciences, we do think that we may be coming off a little bit of a bottom with respect to Life Sciences. And we've talked about the optimism around GLP-1 capacity that we're engaged with and that we expect to continue in that area. In discrete the biggest component of discrete is Automotive. We talked about a minute ago the win at Ford. So customers are still investing, but it's not picked up to a point where we can sound the all clear let's say. We do expect the SAR count to increase in fiscal 2025. EV as a percentage of vehicles sold in the U.S. is expected to go up a little above 10%. It's obviously at a much slower pace than we all envisioned a couple of years ago. And then another element of discrete is e-Commerce and Warehouse Automation. That's also where our data center activity is. That was a bright spot this year for us and we expect that to continue. There's a lot of activity there, not only among the hyperscalers, but also among the other retailers who are looking to modernize and make their operations more efficient. Semiconductor a little bit more mixed. Still expect that to recover. We talked about some activity there, but we're not expecting that to be a big contributor in the year. We're really looking at very gradual sequential growth in orders after Q1. That's what we're expecting triangulating from a variety of points, looking at the different industries. We also look at life cycle with its higher exposure to process, which continues to invest and the relevance of backlog that they have in that segment, contributing positive growth in the year. So we feel comfortable with that. And then with the order progression that I just described being the biggest impact, biggest influence on Software & Control and Intelligent Devices through the year. Yes, see you soon. Hey Andrew. Sure. So, Andrew, let me describe a little bit of the overall process, and if I missed something, then ask me to touch that up. The funnel is tracked probably a little bit differently for pure products that go into MRO versus the big greenfield projects that we look at that we described last year in terms of the typical calendarization of like a big EV project, for instance. And of course, we have both in our business. We track intensely the project work, in some cases a year or two before orders are left there with CapEx across the different industries. And that's where our Lighthouse project group has really shown this year. And as I said, we expect even more activity in the coming year. That funnel looks good and certainly supports the guide with respect to Lifecycle Services. We have a good funnel in ClearPath, for instance, cubic and so on. But between the time that something comes out of the funnel and is won and ordered and shipped that could be months or in some cases a year or more depending on the amount of engineering in that project. When it comes to the products in that funnel, when those come out as an order to us, as you said, we're back to turning those around at a very high rate. The majority of those get serviced within a period of days off our distributor shelf. But even when we have to build it, we can rely on the safety stock that we built up, built back up during the year or building in the plants that's converting at a very high rate. So, I think to your question, from time to get an order to the shipment, what's the overall time? It literally is a period of weeks for those products, a little bit longer for the configure-to-order products that we have in intelligent devices. And again you get into the months. I think average lead time in Lifecycle Services is probably about five or six months. But it certainly varies between digital services and fully engineered systems. So hopefully that touches on some of what you were looking for. Yes, well let me, let me start with a subjective comment and that is I'm seeing a lot of machine builders from Europe in our facility now and we'll see a lot of them at Automation Fair in a couple of weeks. The PACK EXPO show down in Chicago, was close enough to where we're seeing a lot of those machine builders come up and talk to us about their plans going forward, super encouraging. These are big names and they're already decent sized customers, but with lots of opportunities to grow share of their spend. Given that a lot of their end users are investing in the U.S. and they want to be working with the U.S. leader, that's fact. We're definitely hearing that directly from those machine builders and you'll hear from some more of them at Automation Fair as well. In fiscal year 2025, coming off of a year where the overstock condition at European machine builders contributed to big declines, we expect Europe to be decent performing after the Americas. So Americas will be the best performing region in the world in 2025, followed by Europe, followed by Asia, as those overstock conditions completely dissipate and they get back to normal order patterns. Yes, thanks Andrew. Yes, so that would. So, the plus 2% would be a little bit better sequential improvement, either a little bit more pronounced ramp up or a little bit earlier development of the recovery in the end markets that would flip intelligent devices and Software & Control products to positive shipments for the year. So, if you get a little bit higher growth than expected earlier in the year and we continue to build sequentially off of that, that's where you would see the pickup, the lifecycle services, the longer lead time items. Again, given the exposure to process markets and the amount in backlog, I don't see that changing as dramatically. It's really going to be the products that will be the swing votes in this. Yes, see you soon. Sure. Yes, as we said, Americas was the best performing region in 2024 and we expect in 2025 it continued to be the best performing region. We obviously have by far the largest share in the Americas. We've got the best channel; we've got the largest installed base and the deepest relationship. So it's pretty good hand in that case. And we're seeing, as I mentioned before, modest share gains. Obviously our competitors are all interested in the U.S. and expanding that footprint. But we're attacking it with the same sense of urgency and recognizing that we have to take the battle to machine builders and engineering firms around the world as well as continuing to provide, unmatched, very differentiated support for the users here as well, releasing new products, it's the whole equations and it's all hands on deck for that. In terms of the sequentials, I did mention that we saw sequential improvement in orders in Q4 in North America. And we haven't characterized just where we see the sequentials, through the year by region and by products or solutions. But again, we expect Americas to be the best. And I did say that we expect in the so called mega projects that we expect more orders to come from that activity in 2025 than we saw in 2024. And that will become a more and more significant number, as we finally get past the overstock effects of products in the channel. Yes, Chris, great question. The opportunities we're tracking and literally there are thousands of projects that we're looking at and then getting laser focused on the, the top of the funnel where we have the clearest line of sight and they're getting ready to make decisions. If you look at the vertical industries represented by that funnel, it split roughly evenly between the verticals that we don't have as much penetration in that we haven't talked as much about historically. Things like semiconductor balanced by industries that we have great share in, we've talked about forever. We have, extremely high readiness to serve, like Food & Beverage, like Automotive, like Life Sciences. So we went through and characterized that entire basket of projects and it split roughly equal. And each side of that represents hundreds of billions of dollars of CapEx, and very substantial amounts of opportunity for us. And as I've said before, I think we're still in the reasonably early innings of those being awarded. So you're seeing awards for things like data centers for projects now. And while we have some exposure in data centers, it's obviously not the bulk of our business people are placing orders for very long lead time items. I think transformers in some cases are still out two years and so on and we'll see some content from that. But I think the biggest amount of those projects is still to come over, over the next few years. Yes, thanks, Chris. Yes, thanks for the question, Julian. So in terms of the investment, we've taken a lot of care even through the last tough year to preserve spending in areas like customer facing resources as well as R&D for new product introductions and you'll see the continuing increased pace of that at Automation Fair in a couple of weeks, across our portfolio, Software & Control, Intelligent Devices, New Digital Services. I'm very proud of the way that we're getting these new products to market. And in fact in Software & Control, R&D as a percentage of sales is actually double digits. So we continue to preserve that going forward. I think that as we look at getting back to those growth rates, let me also say that after we get past the reset, the very high growth in 2023 17%, top line growth, obviously the decline last year and then the guide for this year, we still hold, and we'll talk more about this in a couple weeks, but we still hold to that framework both in terms of top line as well as margin expectations. And so, while we've made some cuts that are to align the cost structure of the business with current business conditions and incoming orders, some of what we're doing is structural for that long-term as well. We talked about the structural capacity investments that we're making. I just mentioned the continued investment in R&D. So I don't see a sharp snap back because we've been pretty surgical about the cuts that we've made to make sure that we're not cutting the lifeline to future acceleration back to the growth that we talked about at Investor Day last year. Yes, I don't know that I can quantify the relative split because they're interrelated because the velocity of your destock is dependent on end user demand pulling it out of the channel. But the first part of last year of 2024, the effects of just that overstock were more pronounced. The underlying end user to market, end user demand was actually positive, we think. And then towards the end of the year, as we talked about in the last couple of calls, some weakening spread in those end demands and we're at a point where I think it's really most informative to talk about the end user demand. Again, they're linked. There's a little bit of stock left in the channel but it goes as end user demand goes. And so that's really going to be the biggest item as we look at the development in the year. The biggest impact of that will be on the product centric vertical. So think about Automotive where most of our business is done through products going through distributors and some machine builders. Food & Beverage, where packaging is actually, a very large percentage of the total business going into Food & Beverage and that's a product type go to market in those cases. So that's where you see the most of it as opposed to for instance in Oil & Gas or Life Sciences where you have a higher percentage that comes from Digital Services & Engineered Solutions. Yes, thanks Joe. Yes, it's a mix and in some of these there's a mix of OpEx and CapEx as you said. Some of it is facilities expanding cubic to be able to manage the really strong growth in the data center portion of your business. We do have a new facility in India that's providing some additional resilience in the Asian region for us and then digital infrastructure within IT, as we make sure that for internal productivity as well as external productivity with our partners we've got a business system and digital services that is world-class. So those are some of the investments that we're making. We talked about them on the waterfall because of the OpEx portion but there's a little bit of CapEx for those as well. Yes. Thank you."

            "name": "Christian Rothe",
            "content": "Thank you, Blake and good morning everyone. I'm excited to be here this morning and look forward to working with you all over the coming quarters and years. I'll start on slide 8, fourth quarter key financial information. Fourth quarter reported sales were down 21% versus prior year. The positive impact of acquisitions and the negative impact of currency roughly offset each other in the quarter. About two points of our organic growth came from price. Segment operating margin was 20.1% compared to 22.3% a year ago. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower sales volume and unfavorable mix partially offset by our cost reduction actions and no incentive compensation. Adjusted EPS of $2.47 was above our expectations primarily due to price and one-time items. Those one-time items included $22 million benefit from an adjustment to an earn-out accrual tied to achievement of the sellers revenue targets on our ClearPath acquisition. Adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 14.9% below the prior year rate of 17% and about 4 points below our expectations for the quarter. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later Slide. Free cash flow of $367 million was $409 million lower than the prior year, primarily due to lower pretax income. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased approximately 450,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $118 million. On September 30th we had $1.3 billion remaining under our repurchase authorizations. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview for our three operating segments. Intelligent Devices margin of 20.6% decreased 70 basis points year-over-year due to lower sales volume and unfavorable mix. If you exclude the benefit from the ClearPath earn-out adjustment I mentioned earlier, segment margin in Intelligent Devices was 18.3%. Operationally this was about a point below our expectations as better than expected price cost was more than offset by lower volume and other costs including the impact of currency. Purely focusing on decremental conversion after adjusting for the earn-out, the segment had decrementals in the mid-30s year-over-year in the fourth quarter which reflects strong execution on cost out programs against a 20% organic sales decline. Software & Control margin of 22.3% decreased about 1,100 basis points year-over-year due to lower sales volume which was partially offset by cost reduction actions and no incentive compensation. Margins in this segment were below our expectations mainly due to lower shipments of Logix controllers. Revenue from the software portion of Software & Control held up nicely year-over-year. The 39% sales decline in Software & Control was driven by the hardware portion of the business against the historically high shipments in Q4 of the prior year. The typically high decrementals for Software & Control were mitigated somewhat by our cost out actions. Lifecycle Services margin of 17.4% increased 890 basis points year-over-year and was slightly above our expectations. The higher year-over-year segment margin lifecycle was driven by no incentive compensation, strong project execution and Sensia margin improvement. As Blake said, this business performed well throughout fiscal 2024 and the incrementals reflect that. The next Slide 10 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q4 fiscal 2023 to Q4 fiscal 2024. Core performance was down $2.40 on a 21% organic sales decrease with unfavorable segment and product mix driving an outsized flow through. As Blake mentioned, cost reduction actions provided a $70 million benefit in the quarter exceeding our expectations and were a $0.50 tailwind. Incentive compensation was a $0.55 tailwind. This year-over-year delta reflects no bonus payout this year versus an above target payout last year. ClearPath earn-out benefit was $0.20. Year-over-year impact from currency and acquisitions were a $0.05 headwind each whereas tax was a $0.05 tailwind. Shares, interest and other items taken together were a tailwind of $0.03. I want to pause here to briefly discuss the sequential performance for Rockwell from Q3 to Q4. Although it's not in the slide, I think it's informative to discuss the progression, particularly when we later discuss the fiscal 2025 guide. Negative mix was the largest contributor to our decremental sequentially. While reported company wide sales were down $15 million, declines in products in both Intelligent Devices and Software & Control including Logix were more than double that amount. On the other hand, we saw growth in Lifecycle Services and our configure-to-order products which have less favorable margin profile. Further, as mentioned in our Q3 call, the Lifecycle Services segment had some high margin projects ship in Q3 that did not recur in Q4. This negative impact of both volume and mix drove high sequential decremental margins. Sequential currency and pension headwinds were offset by the earn-out adjustment. Moving on, Slide 11 provides key financial information for the full fiscal year 2024. Reported sales declined 9% to $8.3 billion including 1 point of growth coming from acquisitions. Currency was neutral. Organic sales were down 10%. Full year segment margin of 19.3% decreased 200 basis points from last year. The decrease was due to lower sales and again an unfavorable mix that skewed heavily toward products partially offset by no incentive compensation as well as the benefits from cost reduction actions and one-time items including the earn out adjustment. Adjusted EPS was down 20%. A detailed year-over-year adjusted EPS block can be found in the Appendix for your reference Free cash flow conversion was in line with the updated expectations we shared last quarter at about 60% in fiscal 2024. Free cash flow decreased $575 million from fiscal 2023. The decrease in free cash flow was driven by lower pretax income. Inventory and receivables were a source of cash in the fourth quarter as we reduced our balances in line with end demand. Return on Invested capital was 15.2% for fiscal year 2024 and 570 basis points than the prior year, primarily driven by lower income. For the year, we deployed about $1.2 billion of capital toward dividends and share repurchases and made inorganic investments of $750 million at the beginning of the fiscal year for ClearPath and Verve. Our capital structure and liquidity remained strong. Let's now move on to the next Slide 12 to discuss guidance for fiscal 2025. We expect reported sales in a range from negative 4% to positive 2% or slightly below $8.2 billion at the midpoint with no impact from currency or acquisitions. At the midpoint of our sales guidance, which is negative 1%, we expect both Intelligent Devices and Software & Control to be down low single digits and Lifecycle Services to be up low single digits year-over-year. We expect price to contribute about a point of growth for the year and price cost to be favorable. Segment margin is expected to be just under 19% at the midpoint, down about 40 basis points from fiscal year 2024. As Blake mentioned, we continue to expect $250 million in year-over-year benefit from our productivity and margin expansion projects in fiscal year 2025. We look forward to covering more on our productivity and operational excellence journey with you at our upcoming Investor Day in Anaheim. We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. This is about 2 percentage points higher than fiscal 2024, which benefited from some discrete events that will not recur. Our adjusted EPS guidance ranges $8.60 to $9.80 with $9.20 at the midpoint. We expect full year fiscal 2025 free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. Blake mentioned earlier that we expect first quarter sales to be down high single digits sequentially. From a margin standpoint, we expect our Q1 margins to be in the low to mid-teens. Although we don't give quarterly guidance, we thought it would be helpful to give some additional color on how we expect the first quarter to shape up. Intelligent Devices sales are expected to be down low teens sequentially, reflecting soft product demand and a seasonal low in configure to order products. Against this tough volume backdrop, Intelligent Devices will have compensation headwinds and the non-recurrence of the earn out adjustment. As a result, we expect Intelligent Devices segment margins to be in the low teens. Software & Control margin is expected to be in the low 20s on flat sequential sales growth. Lifecycle Services typically has a seasonal low in the first quarter and sales are expected to be down low single digits sequentially. We expect compensation headwinds and the volume impact to drive segment margins in Lifecycle to the low teens. As Blake mentioned, we expect gradual sequential improvement in our sales through the rest of the year. We also expect a corresponding increase in our segment margins. Let's turn to Slide 13 for our adjusted EPS walk for the full year. Our core is expected to be negative $0.20 for the year with more normalized conversion on the 1% sales decline at the midpoint of our guide. Importantly, included in our core is R&D spending, the lifeblood of our future growth, which we continue to target at about 6% of sales. Non-R&D investments planned for fiscal 2025 are expected to be a $0.25 headwind. These investments are structural in nature to position us for future growth. They include expansion of our CUBIC footprint to continue to capture the ongoing data center tailwind, especially in the U.S., our new Rockwell facility in India and IT investments that will provide differentiated performance both inside and outside of Rockwell's walls. Continuing on to the waterfall, our productivity actions are expected to increase EPS by $1.85 reflecting the targeted $250 million cost out savings. Nearly offsetting those savings are compensation and inflation headwinds next year which are expected to decrease EPS by $1.40 at the midpoint of guide. Adjustments to the ClearPath earn-out in Q2 and Q4 of fiscal 2024 result in a $0.25 headwind in fiscal 2025. We expect tax to be a $0.20 headwind. Shares, interest expense and other items taken together are expected to be a $0.06 headwind. To break down the guide another way, our adjusted EPs in fiscal 2024 included about $0.25 of benefit from earn-out adjustments that added about 35 basis points to our segment margins for the year. Our guide of fiscal 2025 segment margins of just under 19% reflects essentially flat segment margins on this adjusted basis year-over-year. The headwinds of a 1% sales decline at the midpoint of our guide, as well as compensation and investment headwinds are expected to be offset at the segment level by our cost out programs. A few additional Comments on Fiscal 2025 guidance for your models, corporate and other expenses is expected to be around $130 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2025 is expected to be about $145 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 113.1 million shares and we are targeting $300 million of share repurchases during the year. With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Yes. So just to -- hi Nigel. To frame it a little bit when we talk about the sequential side of it for kind of the overall organization we have, if we bridge from Q4 into Q1, we've got headwinds, of course the earn out adjustment is not going to recur. We've got headwinds from the perspective of the compensation inflationary side and then on top of that, of course, there's the volume reduction. All of which are going to contribute to going to contribute to some real decrementals as we go into Q1. So you mentioned a number on the EPS. We're not going to actually get into real detail on exactly what that number is, but it will be significantly below $2. Yes, Julian, thanks for the question. So as we think about that sequential as we go through the year, it should continue to improve. That was segment margins that we talked about in the first quarter. So yes, that low to mid-teens number that we, that I discussed was about the segment margin side. And yes, we do expect that that should ramp as the year goes on. In order to get to that 19%. I'm not really going to talk too much about first half, second half, but I do understand the math that you're doing there. Thank you. Yes, so that step down, if you think about the fact that as we were going through the sequentials in 2024, each quarter there was some shipment of backlog that was happening. So the shipments were outstripping the incoming order rate during that period of time and on top of that, we do have some seasonal lows that are happening in the first quarter. So that's, that's a headwind for us in the first quarter and the configured order business is going to be off somewhat well in the first quarter."

Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. [Operator Instruction] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations and Market Strategy. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead.\nAijana Zellner: Thank you, Julianne. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's third quarter fiscal 2024 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include, and our call today will reference, non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. And with that, I'll hand it over to Blake.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Aijana. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we turn to our third quarter results, I'll make some initial comments. As we saw in Q2, operational performance continued to be strong in our third quarter, but order growth continued to ramp at a slower than expected pace. Our accelerated actions to bring costs in line with the lower outlook on current year orders contributed to the strong margin performance in the quarter, and we are well into the more comprehensive program to expand margins introduced during our Investor Day last November. We continue to expect savings of $100 million in the second half of this year from accelerated actions taken this fiscal year, which will create a good starting point for fiscal year 2025. Based on actions taken in the last 12 months, our worldwide headcount is down 6% since Q2, and most others who will be affected have been notified. We will see incremental savings of $120 million next year from these actions alone, plus a larger amount of additional savings from the more comprehensive program, as I'll discuss in a few minutes. We've announced our new CFO, Christian Roth, who starts in two weeks and is excited to begin. Christian brings a successful track record and will work with me and the rest of the team to combine market-beating growth and financial performance in a consistent longer-term model based on the targets introduced last November to create significant share owner value. Turning to specific results in the quarter, Q3 orders were up low single digits, both year-over-year and sequentially, with growth across all regions. However, while our distributors and machine builders are making progress on working down their excess inventory, their orders to us came in lower than expected in the quarter due to weaker end user demand. As a result, we are projecting a more gradual sequential order growth in Q4 and into fiscal year 2025 than we had previously expected. We had another quarter of strong execution with sales, margins, and EPS, all exceeding our expectations. Total and organic sales were down 8.4% versus prior year. Organic sales came in better than we expected, with strong backlog execution in our longer cycle businesses, including lifecycle services and the configured to order products in Intelligent Devices. Organic sales in our Intelligent Devices segment were down by about a point versus prior year. We continue to see a solid pipeline of projects across all product lines, including good opportunities involving Clearpath's auto mobile robots and cubic data center solutions. In software and control, organic sales declined over 31% year-over-year compared to 24% growth in Q3 of last year. Sales in this segment were still better than expected, driven by better Logix recovery as machine builders reduced their inventory. We also saw good growth in our software business, including both on-prem and cloud-native offerings. For example, in the quarter, we had over 150 new logos for a recently launched FactoryTalk optics portfolio. This reinforces the importance of continued investment in innovation and new product introduction as we continue to redeploy and prioritize our spend towards areas of highest growth and strategic importance. We've talked a lot about cost savings during this challenging year, but we're taking great care to preserve the investments that will enable us to continue to grow share. Lifecycle services had another strong quarter, with organic sales up over 11% year-over-year, driven by continued relative strength in process end markets and strong execution of our project backlog. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.0. We did see some additional project delays, especially affecting our solutions orders. Some manufacturing customers are taking a pause in making large capacity investments as they deal with slower consumer demand, high interest rates, and policy uncertainty around tax tariffs and stimulus incentives. Even so, our customers are still investing in their operational resilience, reflected by continued double-digit sales growth of our recurring managed services. Total ARR for the company was up a strong 17% this quarter. Segment margin of 20.8% and adjusted EPS of $2.71 were well above our expectations. We're making good progress on driving productivity across the enterprise and we are seeing the benefits of these actions with over $40 million of savings in Q3 alone. Turning to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q3 industry segment performance. Last quarter we talked about some project delays and end user CapEx slowdown in parts of our business, namely automotive and food and beverage. We saw project delays across a broader group of industries this quarter, which will impact our end market performance through the end of the fiscal year. Sales in our discrete industries were down high single digits versus prior year, with declines in auto and semi being partially offset by year-over-year growth in warehouse automation. Within discrete, automotive sales declined high teens versus prior year. Brand owners are delaying more EV programs as they continue to reassess their product strategy in light of slower consumer adoption and policy uncertainty in the U.S. Semiconductor sales were down high teens. We continue to see delays in new capacity builds and the associated tooling, due in part to questions about the timing and certainty of CHIPS funding disbursements. E-commerce and warehouse automation sales grew high teens versus prior year, led by strong double-digit growth in North America. We continue to see a broad-based recovery at our end-user and machine builder customer segments. Moving to hybrid, sales in this industry segment were down mid-teens, driven by year-over-year declines in food and beverage and Life Sciences. Food and beverage sales decreased mid-teens in the quarter. Producers in certain segments of the food and beverage market, like baking and snacks, are seeing inflationary headwinds as consumers shift from high-end brands to more affordable labels. We're seeing less greenfield activity, but we do continue to see high demand for software and services that optimize processes to increase efficiency. Life Sciences sales were down high teens. Similar to food and beverage, customers and Life Sciences are prioritizing investments in their operational resilience and infrastructure. In the quarter, we had important wins with two leading pharmaceutical companies. The Life Sciences of Merck in Darmstadt, Germany, which operates in the U.S. and Canada as Millipore Sigma, selected Rockwell to assess the company's current plant infrastructure and help enhance the digital connectivity and cybersecurity resilience of operational assets. Another important Q3 win in Life Sciences was with AstraZeneca. Together with our partner, Claroty, we're helping the customer identify and monitor plan assets, detect threats, and integrate internal services and systems to provide a comprehensive global cyber platform for all of their OT environments. Process sales were mixed across the individual vertical markets. Overall, sales were about flat year-over-year with growth in oil and gas and mining offset by declines in chemicals and metals. Oil and gas sales grew low single digits this quarter. Within this segment, our Sensia JV sales grew double digits versus prior year with good growth in process automation and digital solutions offerings. And while we continue to win business in the energy transition space, we did see some North America project push outs tied to customers wanting to understand potential policy changes that may occur after the U.S. elections in November. In mining, our sales increased high single digits versus prior year. Our growth in the quarter was driven by continued double digit growth in Latin America. Here, Rockwell was chosen to integrate an end-to-end solution for Vale's new processing plant. As this customer looks to increase production capacity, reduce water consumption, and enhance cybersecurity infrastructure. This is a great example of how Rockwell brings our hardware, software, and services together to deliver differentiated value for our end users. Let's turn to Slide 5 and our Q3 organic regional sales. The Americas continue to outperform the rest of the world with North America sales flat year-over-year in the quarter and Latin America sales up almost 19%. EMEA sales were down 28% with continued macroeconomic challenges across Germany, Italy and France, impacting end user demand. Despite these headwinds, we continue to make progress with our European machine builders to gain share in the end user market. In the quarter, IMA Group, an Italian-based leader in designing and developing packaging machines, has sold over a dozen machines equipped with our Rockwell platform. By recognizing the technical advantage of our motion control capabilities, coupled with the time to market provided by our integrated architecture solution, their end user, who's based in Germany, is now looking to adopt Rockwell as its preferred choice in all future commissions. Asia Pacific sales declined 22%. In addition to continued inventory de-stocking and economic challenges in China, we saw incremental headwinds from EV battery project delays in Korea this quarter. Moving to Slide 6 for a fiscal 2024 outlook. While our orders are improving sequentially, they're progressing at a more gradual pace than we anticipated. We believe this is largely tied to a pause in new capacity investments as manufacturers focus on cost control and operational efficiency, waiting for a potential reduction in interest rates and broader U.S. policy changes. Therefore, we're reducing our fiscal year 2024 guidance to reflect this gradual pace of orders growth. Taking into account our order progression through early August, we now expect Q4 orders to be up low single digits sequentially. With that, we expect our organic sales to decline 10% for the year. We continue to expect acquisitions to contribute about a point and a half of growth, and we expect currency to be about neutral for the year. Total ARR is expected to grow about 15% and will exceed 10% of total Rockwell sales this year. We now expect our segment margin to be slightly over 19% for the year. While this represents about a 200 basis point decrease versus last year. It also shows the improving resilience of our business model. Adjusted EPS is slated to decline 21% versus prior year. We expect free cash flow conversion of 60%. Nick will cover this in more detail in his section. Before I turn the call over to Nick, I'd like to spend a few moments on Slide 7 to discuss the progress we're making in setting the foundation for long-term productivity and margin expansion. We already talked about the accelerated actions we're taking in the second half of this fiscal year to drive efficiency and scale across our entire company, and we remain committed to delivering $100 million of savings this year and $120 million of incremental savings in fiscal year 2025, mainly targeted at reducing our SG&A spend. We will continue to optimize our general and administrative spend through a targeted approach, although the majority of additional productivity and margin expansion will be realized as a result of reductions in our cost of sales. As you can see from this chart, we expect to save another $130 million in fiscal year 2025 through additional margin expansion and productivity projects bring our total fiscal year 2025 year-over-year savings to roughly $250 million. You can see the broad list of actions and programs that are underway to realize these targets. These productivity projects include savings in the areas of product cost, indirect material, purchase services, logistics, manufacturing workflow, make or buy decisions, portfolio optimization through SKU reduction, and price. We look forward to our new CFO, Christian Roth's additional perspective as we maximize the effectiveness of this program in fiscal year 2025 and preserve it as a foundational part of our operating model going forward, regardless of the top-line growth in any particular year. Let me now turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q3 performance and financial outlook for fiscal 2024. Nick?\nNick Gangestad: Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8, third quarter key financial information. Third quarter reported and organic sales were down 8.4% compared to last year. Acquisitions contributed 60 basis points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by 60 basis points. About 350 basis points of organic growth came from price this quarter. Segment operating margin was 20.8% compared to 21.1% a year ago. Margin performance in the quarter reflects lower sales volume and an unfavorable mix, largely offset by positive price cost, lower incentive compensation, and the benefits from cost reduction actions we announced on our last earnings call. Adjusted EPS of $2.71 was higher than expectations, driven by better revenue, mix, and savings from our cost actions. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was 13.3%, benefiting from discrete tax items and below the prior year rate. Free cash flow was $238 million compared to $240 million in the prior year. Our lower year-over-year free cash flow generation in the quarter was driven by lower pretax income, but was mostly offset by lower working capital, which improved for the second consecutive quarter, but at a slower rate than anticipated. One additional item not shown on the slide. We repurchased approximately 600,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $160 million. On June 30th, $500 million remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Intelligent Devices margin increased to 20.2% compared to 16.8% a year ago. The increase from the prior year was driven by positive price cost, lower incentive compensation, and our cost reduction actions, partially offset by lower sales volume. Software and control margin of 23.6% decreased from 34.8% last year. The lower margin was driven by lower sales volume, partially offset by positive price cost, lower incentive compensation, and our cost reduction actions. As Blake mentioned earlier, software and control margin exceeded our expectations this quarter with better performance in Logix sales. Lifecycle Services margin of 19.3% more than doubled from the year ago margin of 9.3%. The margin performance was driven by lower incentive compensation, higher sales, continued strong project execution, and ongoing savings from the prior year structural actions. Lifecycle Services book-to-bill was 1.0. The next, Slide 10 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q3 fiscal 2023 to Q3 fiscal 2024. Core performance was down $0.80 on an 8.4% organic sales decline. The EPS decline was driven by lower volume and unfavorable mix and was partially offset by positive price cost. Cost reduction actions contributed 30 cents to the year-over-year increase. Incentive compensation was a 40-cent tailwind. This year-over-year increase reflects no projected bonus payout this year versus an above-target payout last year. The dilution impact from acquisitions was $0.10, and currency was a $0.15 headwind. Share count, interest expense, and tax were a combined $0.05 cent tailwind. Let's now move on to the next Slide, 11, guidance for fiscal 2024. We are lowering our guidance for fiscal 2024. We now expect reported sales to decline by about 8.5% and organic sales to decline 10%. As Blake mentioned earlier, we continue to expect acquisitions to add 150 basis points to growth. And we now expect currency to be neutral for the year on continued strength in the U.S. dollar. We continue to expect price to be a positive contributor for the year. We now expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 16%. We are lowering our adjusted EPS guidance to $9.60, down 21% year-over-year. With lower sales, our improvements in inventory days will be delayed, and we now expect to end fiscal year 2024 with 160 days of inventory. As a result, we expect full-year free cash flow conversion of about 60% of adjusted income. Our free cash flow conversion for the year also reflects several non-recurring headwinds, including our second half restructuring actions, the timing of our cash bonus payout, and tax payments for both the TCJA transition tax and our prior year PTC gain. From a top-line perspective, we expect flat sequential sales in Q4 in each of our business segments. Sequentially, we expect margins in Q4 to be about 100 basis points lower than in Q3. By segment, we expect our Q4 margin in Intelligent Devices to decline about 100 basis points, and Lifecycle Services margin to decline about 200 basis points sequentially. In both segments, we expect the decline to be driven by a less favorable mix. We expect margin in software and control to be similar to Q3. A few additional comments on fiscal 2024 guidance. Corporate and other expense is still expected to be around $130 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 114.5 million shares. We still expect to deploy between $600 million and $800 million to share repurchases during the year. Net interest expense for fiscal 2024 is now expected to be $140 million. Before I pass it on to Blake, I'd like to talk about how actions we're taking this year are going to benefit our results in fiscal 2025 and beyond. As you heard earlier, we expect our productivity and margin expansion actions to provide about $250 million in year-over-year benefit next year. These are expected to offset compensation headwinds next year, which includes merit increases and the reinstatement of incentive compensation. The $250 million in benefits is split about equally between improvements in gross margin and reductions in SG&A. We expect R&D spending next year to remain similar as a percentage of sales as we continue to invest in areas of highest growth. With my upcoming retirement, I'd like to thank Blake for this opportunity and to thank all of you for your engagement over the last several years. Thank you. With that, I'll turn it over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Nick. This will be Nick's last earnings call with us. I'd like to thank him again for his commitment to Rockwell's mission over the last few years. He's working closely with Christian for a smooth transition, and we wish Nick and his family the very best in retirement. Christian will join me in leading the fourth quarter earnings call and Investor Day in November. As always, Investor Day takes place during our Annual Automation Fair. Last year, over 8,500 customers, distributors, partners, and investors joined us in Boston. Registration opens tomorrow for the 2024 event in Anaheim, California, which takes place during the week of November 18. This year, the fair offers an expanded four days of show floor access, showcasing major new hardware, software, and services offerings. Rockwell's technology portfolio, domain expertise, and unmatched ecosystem uniquely position us to help customers in our home market of North America and around the world. We look forward to seeing you in Anaheim in just over three months. Aijana, we will now begin the Q&A session.\nA - Aijana Zellner: Thanks, Blake. We'd like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Julian, let's take our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nScott Davis: Hey, good morning, Blake and Nick and Aijana. Congrats, Nick, on your retirement\u2026\nBlake Moret: Good morning.\nNick Gangestad: Thanks, Scott.\nScott Davis: Hope we all keep in touch. But hey, guys, I hate to climb into minutiae, but just to kind of clarify the $250 million a little bit. Normally I think I recall your bonus pool something like $160 million ballpark. So would we think for 2025 something we wanted to model conservatively, would it be $160 million or so incentive comp that comes back and to kind of cut into a little bit of that $250 million or is the number bigger than that?\nNick Gangestad: Scott the $250 million is exactly as you said, as a year-over-year benefit from the productivity and cost safe margin actions we're taking. We expect the bonus expense next year if we're delivering to plan to be between $160 million and $170 million. Other things on top of that where I'm saying it's largely being the $250 million in total cost and margin benefits are being largely offset by bonus and other compensation. I'm including our anticipated merit increase for fiscal year 2025 which will round that out to about $250 million when I add in the bonus. Is that clear, Scott?\nScott Davis: Yes, that's clear. Thanks, Nick. And then when you guys -- I know you're not issuing your 2025 guidance and we still have a little time here, but when you think about incremental margins, let's just assume we get back to growth in 2025 on the easier comps. Would you expect incremental margins to be a little higher than they have been historically based on some of this kind of SKU rationalization, the other stuff that's on the -- on Slide 7, would that be a fair assumption to make guys?\nBlake Moret: Scott, we\u2019re -- that's certainly the objective is to increase the conversion on incremental revenue. Last November we talked about 35% and we said that that wasn't going to be dependent on mid-single digit top line growth. So a little bit more aggressive stance there. We'll hold off before talking about exactly what we expect in terms of core conversion, but you can bet that that's on our mind to increase the incremental conversion on revenue.\nScott Davis: Okay, fair enough. I'll pass it on. Thank you, guys.\nBlake Moret: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks again, Nick.\nNick Gangestad: Hey, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Blake, can you give us a little more color into your comment that you expect to see continued order growth sequentially and into next year, despite manufacturers taking a pause in adding capacity. Where does that confidence come from? Do distributors still expect to clear their channels in next quarter or two? How much in incremental orders could the end of de-stocking be versus maybe the $2 billion that you're guiding to for Q4? And how are you thinking about the order and revenue landscape in 2025? Do you think $2 billion is a quarterly trough that Rockwell bounce off of?\nBlake Moret: Sure. Andy, for a little bit of context, we have talked in the third quarter about expecting mid-single digit sequential order growth. We've seen sequential order growth through the year, and we said, because we were continuing to see the impact of excess inventories at distributors and machine builders that was going to yield mid-single digit order growth. As that kind of merges with some weakening in end markets, that's where we saw the low single digit sequential orders growth in Q3. And we think that that continues. So rather than a one or two quarter sharper bounce back, We think this is going to continue to be a gradual recovery. Inventories are depleting, both at our distributors and our machine builders. But we have seen some weaker conditions in end markets. And I would characterize that in a couple of buckets. You see a couple that are affected by consumer demand, such as automotive, as consumers are going a little slower in a rush to EV. And you also see it in food and beverage and home and personal care. We see consumers, and you've heard this from the brand owners themselves, are going a little bit down brand as they're being more discriminating on what they pay for packaged goods. Then you also see some pressure based on policy uncertainty going forward. I would say semiconductor and questions about the disbursement of CHIPS and Science Act funds are weighing on semi manufacturers and then an energy transition. So in those broad buckets, that tempers our view on the good side, on the tailwind side, as we go into next year, we're going to be lapping some of the quarters that had the most significant -- that were more significantly impacted in this fiscal year by inventory. And there'll certainly be a lot less inventory at distributors and machine builders in Q1 of fiscal year 2025, for instance, than there was in Q1 of fiscal year 2024.\nAndy Kaplowitz: It's helpful. And, Nick, last quarter you suggested, I think, that two-thirds of your cost out program this year would be in Q4 and one-third in Q3. So it's a little strange to see that you're estimating lower margin in Q4 versus Q3 just based on mix in Intelligent Devices and Lifecycle Services. So maybe just give us a little more color on how the cost program this year is divided between Q3 and Q4. And then the comments on Logix getting better. Do we see Logix continue to get better from here in Q4?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, a couple things there, Andy. First of all, the mix between Q3 and Q4 on the $100 million of cost savings that we're expecting, that's shifted a little. I earlier had said one-third, two-thirds, it's now more like 40-60 between Q3 and Q4. We got some good progress in Q3, a little ahead, moving some of those actions earlier. So the differential isn't quite as big between Q3 and Q4 as what we thought three months ago. Now moving into margin and what we're expecting going into Q4 for margin. We had some things noticeably impact our margin better than what we were expecting in Q3. Primarily we guided in Q3 that we expected our -- in our software and control business, we expected a sequential decline of 20%, which would have -- what we said on our last call is that, we thought that would bring our margins in software and control down to the mid-teens. With the strength in the Logix, orders and sales that we saw in Q3, that did not materialize to that level. It ended up, rather than software and control being down 20%, it was down 10%. And that extra revenue and the mixed benefit that brings help boost the margins in software and control much higher than what we were estimating. And that's the primary driver of our over performance of margin in Q3. Now into Q4, we will be getting the benefit of these additional cost actions. In software and control, we don't see an additional ramp up happening in Q4 for our Logix sales. We think that'll be very, very similar to what we saw in Q3. In fact, we think what we saw in Q3 is going to be almost a carbon copy into Q4 from a revenue standpoint, from a margin standpoint for software and control. Intelligent Devices and Lifecycle Services, we expect for both of those a sequential decline. We had some -- both of those businesses had some favorable mix. Driven by, in Q3, we see some of that mix reversing into Q4. And in Lifecycle services, it's part of our customer and project mix that was very beneficial to us in Q3. We think that'll abate some in Q4 and why we see margins going down a couple hundred basis points sequentially. Still part of a more than doubling the margin for the full year than what we saw last year. And then Intelligent Devices, we see about 100 basis point drop in margin. That is also driven by some of our product and project mix there.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Appreciate all the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: Hey, thank you, good morning. Good luck, Nick.\nNick Gangestad: Thanks, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Hey. Maybe the term normal is sort of hard to use here at all. But if we look at Q4 revenues flat, I don\u2019t know, maybe up slightly sequentially, my words, you said flat. That looks like kind of a -- sort of a pre-COVID normal pattern. As we all -- the biggest task of us analysts here this morning, right, is to get in front of your 2025 guide and make an educated guess, I think as you well understand. I mean, how would you view this Q4 2025 jumping off point in the context of what has been historically normal? And how should that inform our view of 2025?\nBlake Moret: Jeff, I'll offer some comments on that. I think to start with, what is largely back to normal is orders and sales of our products kind of coming back right on top of each other. So getting back to historical pre-COVID levels of book-and-bill. When you get an order for a drive or a Logix controller in the quarter, being able to ship it down and recognize the revenue in the same quarter. Back to very high percentage conversion, operational performance is good. Customers are looking for that material in about the same time frame that they were previously. So that's really good news and puts orders and shipments back very similar from quarter-to-quarter in terms of products. As we look at next year, we're going to be lapping some extremely low order rates. And so, beginning with the fourth quarter, as we start thinking about year-over-year rates again, you're going to see some big numbers in the fourth quarter and likely going into next year. And we do see continued investment. We talked about project delays, but we're winning projects as well. We are seeing the impact of higher than traditional levels of investment, despite the uncertainty for North American manufacturing plant. So I think looking at Q4 as a jumping off point is inevitable, but as we said, we expect continued gradual sequential increases into next year and then we'll certainly be given a lot more detail in November.\nJeff Sprague: Yes, right. But so putting the order comps aside, right, if book-and-bill are kind of linked up and they're still channel inventory, we should have some quarters for the year of your order comps look good, but kind of sequential revenue patterns don't sound like we should expect anything too unusual. And perhaps there's even, I don't know, some risk if the economy ends up getting weaker here than we anticipate.\nBlake Moret: There's certainly risk with that, Jeff, but there's also the amount of business that we didn't ship in the beginning of the year because there was inventory sitting at distributors and that was a meaningful number throughout the year and it's far less as we move into next year. So you get some tailwind from that.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thank you very much.\nBlake Moret: Yep. Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thank you. This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew. On that point about de-stocking, it sounds as though you are mainly done with it in North America. How's the visibility for regions outside of there?\nBlake Moret: Yes, so our visibility into distributor stock is very clear for the distributors on our DMI program, which is 100% of the distributors in North America. And it's not all the way gone, but the vast majority of it has dissipated there. We see continuing stubborn inventory in China, and we'll call that out, and that's going to take a little while to get to the bottom of that, because if you think about it, what paces those inventory levels has a lot to do with the end market demand. And so, if that is weaker, then it's going to take longer to burn through that stock sitting on distributor shelves. But we have very clear visibility in the US where the vast majority of our business goes through distribution. I painted the picture in China and then we have a higher amount of direct business with machine builders in Europe, there it's basically talking with them about what their levels are. And we have consistent questions that we review with them on a monthly basis. We're confident it continues to go down, but it's not all the way there yet.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thank you. And then a quick follow-up on Lifecycle Services margins, if we take a third quarter and what you're expecting for fourth quarter, would you expect margin progression from that sort of blended second half margin as you go and continue to add volumes?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, our Lifecycle Services margin -- thanks for pointing that out. It certainly has been a noticeable improvement over fiscal year 2023 with our margins for the -- our estimate for the full year of more than doubling. A portion of that year-on-year improvement in the margin and in the margin you're seeing is coming from the absence of any kind of bonus or incentive compensation this year. The majority of our improvement is coming through better profitability in our Sensia joint venture. It's coming through structural productivity that we set in place late last year. It's coming through better project execution. Those aspects we think that will continue to build into fiscal year 2025. But I just will point out that the benefit from the incentive compensation, we expect that not to be repeated into fiscal year 2025. If incentive compensation were paid as per the plan, that would have reduced life cycle services margin for the full year by approximately 200 basis points.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning and good luck, Nick. So obviously, good news that sell-in to distribution is sort of being matched by order rates, et cetera. But any color in terms of how the sell through from distributors into their customers is tracking for Rockwell products? I think that the message has been that distributors have been cutting inventory levels. It seems like the actual end user demand is weaker for the reasons you cited. So I'm just curious how your intelligence on days of inventory on hand, on shelves, has been tracking through the quarter. And then just maybe just talk about how you've seen this progressing into FY 2025? I know, Jeff, had a crack at 2025, but do you think that we're still in the status now until we get past the election?\nBlake Moret: So a couple of comments, and then I think Nick may provide some additional color. In the quarter, inventory reduced nicely at distributors. So tracking that, as I mentioned before, pretty explicitly with our DMI program, being able to look at the high runners, the A items, as well as the B and the C items, we saw an overall reduction of the inventory levels and through that -- first part of the year we saw positive year-over-year growth in shipments coming out of our distributors to the end users. So as we talked to them, they have been having a reasonably good year as they're shipping out, particularly to those end users where they're not dealing with higher stock at the machine builders.\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Nigel, a couple things to add. One is, yes, we do track the amount of new orders being placed on our distributors. And what we see there is, we are seeing that continuing to go up. But part of what we're highlighting in our revised estimate for Q4 is we're not seeing go up at the pace that we were expecting, implying that the end demand is not as robust as what we were thinking three months ago. And then in terms of your question about added visibility into 2025, I'm sure you were asking more about revenue, but I will just add from a margin perspective, what are some of the headwinds and tailwinds we're thinking about for margin next year? The headwinds we've talked about of compensation, both the bonus and our annual merit increase, and we expect to continue investments in new products and digital offerings. Tailwinds that we expect in our margin next year. That $250 million of margin expansion and cost reduction actions we think will be -- we know will be benefiting margin next year. We continue to expect positive price cost next year and then we expect continued margin improvement from our recent acquisitions in the last two or three and that coupled with, right now what's anticipated, no new M&A, we think that will also be marginally enhancing for us in 2025.\nNigel Coe: Okay. That's great color, Nick, just a quick one on M&A contribution for the quarter. Came in quite a bit lighter than what we were looking for. Just wondering if there's any seasonality or timing of shipments we should bear in mind then?\nBlake Moret: Yes, I mean the biggest contributor to the M&A this year is Clearpath and the mobile robots. That's project business. I mean those are fairly expensive sales. And so, it's going to be lumpy through the year. We're seeing very strong year-over-year growth overall for that business, but it's going to move around a little bit from month-to-month and quarter to quarter. We remain very optimistic and proud of the accomplishments of that acquisition as well as the verb on the cybersecurity side.\nNigel Coe: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe I just wanted to start off with inventories, but more around your own inventories than perhaps the customer level. I think your own inventories are only about 8% off the sort of all-time highs and sales in the current quarter look like they're maybe 20% off the year ago level. So I'm curious why your customers and distributors it seems have got inventories down a lot but you haven't. So I'm trying to understand why there's been that discrepancy or disconnect. And sort of allied to that, often I think at Rockwell and others when you get a sales shortfall, you get super normal free cash flow conversion, but for you we're getting cash conversion guide coming down with the revenue guide coming down. So that's just very unusual for this kind of business model. So maybe any sort of highlights around that please.\nNick Gangestad: Sure, Julian. Thanks for asking. So from an inventory standpoint, given where we have been in the last 2.5 years in terms of ensuring that our customers are getting the products they need. We have been very focused on making sure that we have the stock we need in place to be meeting our customers' requirements. As we went through the \u2013 our plans for fiscal year 2024, as we went through the year, is that we expected that in the second half of this year we would be seeing increased demand on us depleting quite a bit of that excess inventory that we ourselves are holding. As we're seeing the demand on us not having that ramp up, but more of this gradual increase that we're talking about, that's leaving us with noticeably more inventory in terms of days of inventory at the end of our fiscal year than what we were estimating earlier in the year or even three months ago. And that's the most significant part of our cash conversion story. In terms of our prior guide of 80% now bringing it down to 60%, we've known all along we have these one-time non-recurring headwinds, things like our extra tax payments that we'd be doing well in excess of our tax expense. We also knew that we'd be having the cash payments for our restructuring actions. So those things are contemplated as part of that 80%, but we were also counting on a noticeable roll down in that working capital and inventory in the second half of the year. And while it's still going to come down in the second half of the year, it's not going to come down nearly at the pace. That's really going to be more of a 2025 development for us.\nJulian Mitchell: That's great. Thank you. And maybe just one follow-up on the broader demand environment. So it seems as sort of a couple of things happening. I think one is, Blake, as you mentioned, sort of orders sequentially are improving. So the overall backdrop sequentially looks a little bit better as we move along. But you also highlighted CapEx reductions at customers and project delays, which I suppose is something new versus say six months ago when the talk was only about destocking headwinds of inventory. So it seems we've moved sort of seamlessly from de-stock into CapEx cuts. Just wondered sort of when did those CapEx cuts start to become evident to you in earnest? And any kind of thoughts around demand cadence in the last month or two in general?\nBlake Moret: Yes, so we did talk in the last quarter about some weaker CapEx spend, particularly in food and beverage and auto, around new capacity. We indicated that while, for instance, food and beverage customers are still investing in resilience and efficiency, they're pausing new capacity. And similarly -- and I think the well-read theme of EV slowing down a bit as well. We're still seeing projects and behavior that we would characterize as delays, push outs, but not cancellations. And we certainly hope that it doesn't move to that. We're watching it. We're taking a clear-eyed view of what's happening out there. But people are pushing for some of the reasons I mentioned before, as we said, looking at consumer demand, interest rates, and then some policy uncertainty. It doesn't all just stop until the elections, for instance. So we're going to see major projects that are awarded this quarter that are coming from customers across a variety of industries, but not at the pace that we would have thought, say, three or four months ago. And you're right. The dominant theme for the first part of this year was the inventory issue at distributors and machine builders. And now, as that dissipates, we're seeing some pause in capital spend in manufacturing.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nBlake Moret: Yes, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nNoah Kaye: Thanks. So I'll just bundle a couple of questions here to keep it moving. First, can we actually quantify the revenue impact of the inventory de-stocking in the channel as contemplated in full year guidance. What is the actual revenue headwinds, just so we can level set for next year? And two, thinking about sort of the routability of the cost actions benefiting the P&L. When we get the reinstatement of bonus comp and merit increases, presumably those are fairly rattleable throughout next year, quarterly. Should we think about the same for the cost actions that you're announcing today?\nBlake Moret: So I'll take the first one and then Nick will chime in on the calendarization of the cost actions. We haven't given a specific figure in terms of the inventory at distribution and machine builders, but it's hundreds of millions of dollars. And it's a larger factor, as I've said before, than some of the investments that we've seen in North America. So it's a bigger number than the business on the good side that's been won this year based on investment in North America. It's dissipating, we're seeing a smaller contribution in each quarter, but it's been stubborn. And as we said, we expect that there's not going to be one month all clear where suddenly it's gone. And that's why we say gradual sequential improvement in orders in this quarter and then into next year.\nNick Gangestad: Yes. And then, Noah, as far as the quarterization or calendarization of the benefits of that $250 million. Well, first let me say, you are correct about the bonus, that that will be like largely equal throughout the four quarters of fiscal year 2025. But in terms of the calendarization, of course, we'll add that kind of information in the November meeting for more detail. That said, what I can tell you is the restructuring benefits are more front half loaded, the things that we started in Q3, whereas those additional margin expansion benefits that we talked about that go on top of that, that is more second half loaded. But the actual calendarization of all of this, we'll share more of that in November.\nNoah Kaye: Very helpful on both fronts. Thank you.\nBlake Moret: Yep, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nSteve Tusa: Hi. Good morning.\nNick Gangestad: Hey, Steve.\nBlake Moret: Good morning.\nSteve Tusa: Nick, I guess for the second time, thanks for all the help and congrats. I just wanted to make sure I understood the bridge items for next year. So you're basically saying that next year is relatively clean when it comes to all these moving parts. I guess, he didn't talk about growth investments, but I would assume you kind of toggle those with the volume picture. So can you just clarify if there is anything else outside of those, the $250 million and then the merit and incentive comp, anything we're missing?\nBlake Moret: So I'll start with the general comment and then Nick can add detail. But you're right, Steve. The productivity that we're looking at, the combination of the actions that were primarily reductions in force on the second half of this year, and the items in the more comprehensive program offsets the headwinds from compensation into next year. We expect our R&D spend, which is part of that overall operating spend. If you add R&D and SG&A together, that's our operating spend. And we expect R&D to be roughly similar as a percentage of sales next year.\nNick Gangestad: Yes, and I think what I'll add to that, this $250 million that we're projecting for next year, that is roughly half of that that we see as benefiting gross margin and roughly half of that that we see reducing our SG&A spending. We're striving to keep our ongoing investments in R&D in light of the opportunities we see there as a percent of revenue relatively flat.\nSteve Tusa: Right, but basically, like, whatever I want to assume on volume is what the picture is as far as earnings drop through is concerned. Like, simple as that, it sounds like. There aren't too many other bridge items.\nNick Gangestad: Yeah The five I shared on Nigel\u2019s question, those are big five there.\nSteve Tusa: Yes, okay. And then just one last question for you. I mean, so it sounds like you overproduced a bit, I\u2019m sure you have the benefit of that offset obviously by the negative mix. As you take inventory down next year do we look at the drop through on whatever volumes we assume is being neutral to positive on mix, because that should be a little bit more normal, but then you obviously get hit with the overproduction, so it's still kind of that into that more normal like 35% range for you guys?\nBlake Moret: Talk a little bit more about what you mean by overproduction, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Just your inventories are up, right? So there's -- you overproduced relative to what the shipments were, just with inventories up. Or am I wrong about that?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, in the last two or three quarters, it's -- Steve, it's -- the inventory is in both the last two quarters not going up. They're just not coming down as fast as we thought. And we think that pace of it coming down will accelerate in 2025. But in terms of volume in our factories, in terms of a negative headwind from underutilization in 2025 versus 2024, we don't anticipate that's a material impact on fiscal year 2025.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Great. Thanks all for the color, as always, and enjoy retirement, Nick. Thanks.\nNick Gangestad: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning guys. And Nick, wish you the best in retirement. Thanks for everything.\nNick Gangestad: Thanks, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Yeah, my first question, and I know, look, we're all trying to figure out 2025, and I know that your business is fairly short cycle. But if I look at some of your two -- like your two biggest end markets being food and beverage and auto, this year you're going to be coming up against maybe one more tough comp in the fourth quarter. I guess Blake, as you kind of think through the conversations you're having with your customers and the environment that we're in, is there a scenario where you don't grow in 2025 and what's the realistic expectation going forward?\nBlake Moret: Joe, I'm going to stay away from bigger than a bread box type of dimensioning for next year. But the customers we're talking to, including in automotive and food and beverage, are continuing to make investments in those areas. We look at not just potential capacity that they're adding, but it's about resilience, efficiency in existing facilities. It's one of the things that excites us about the mobile robots, for instance, is that -- most of that's going into existing facilities. So customers, just like Rockwell, are working on their efficiency and their cost, regardless of what's going on in the external environment. And we're really well prepared to address that. So I mentioned before, as we start getting into -- back into year-over-year growth in orders, we'll characterize what that means for shipments into the next year, but I'm very confident with our position.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe lastly, just a near-term question as we think about the fourth quarter. In the Intelligent Devices segment, it seems like historically we've seen this uptick in the fourth quarter on revenue. It seems like you guys are implying that that business is going to be down a bunch. If any color around that would be helpful for 4Q.\nNick Gangestad: Joe, we're implying that Intelligent Devices revenue will be almost exactly the same sequentially between Q3 and Q4. It's not -- we're not expecting a noticeable uptick or downtick sequentially in intelligent devices revenue.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, just not the typical seasonal uptick that you would normally see [indiscernible]?\nNick Gangestad: Not a seasonal uptick there.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, great. All right. Thank you both.\nAijana Zellner: Julianne, we'll take one more question.\nOperator: Certainly, Aijana. Our last question will come from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJoe O'Dea: Hi, thanks for fitting me in. I wanted to start on the -- Hi. I wanted to start on the margin expansion and productivity in terms of: one, understanding the structural versus temporary components of this; and then two, just in terms of understanding the breadth of it. Obviously, a lot of different elements all rolling up to the savings here. And so just the genesis of this and how these opportunities have developed over time in terms of greater manufacturing efficiency or sourcing efficiency or SG&A efficiency. It seems like there's a lot out there. And so just kind of understanding how that opportunity came to be.\nBlake Moret: Sure, Joe, broadly, we've spent a lot of the last few years adding some capabilities that I felt we needed to move faster in, things like software capability, high-value services like cybersecurity, and some particular technologies like mobile robots, independent car technology, industrial PCs. At the same time, we've been playing a lot of defense with COVID, with supply chain volatility that has introduced inevitably some inefficiencies into our own processes. And so for several reasons, now is the time to integrate the parts, to bring together the things that we built and bought over the last few years, and to drive out some of the inefficiency that's built up with programs like this. And it necessarily involves headcount reduction, as well as actions aimed at reducing our cost of goods sold. And so it's a broad-based approach that will yield benefits in this year as we talked about into next year. But then it gets rolled into a continuous operating model of continuous improvement that continues to drive these costs out and be vigilant to make sure that new costs don't creep in. The benefits, of course, are for an investor standpoint, expanding margins to go with the higher growth levels. For customers, there's also a benefit. Things that we're doing to reduce that long tail of SKUs can actually increase customer service for the more frequently bought items. And when we reduce the cost of goods sold, we have the opportunity to be even more competitive on the projects that we choose to go after. So for a variety of reasons, integrating the parts and driving inefficiency out is the right time in our journey to introduce this as we started last November at Investor Day and will certainly be given more of an update in just a few months.\nJoe O'Dea: And so primarily structural in terms of how we think about the cost coming out?\nBlake Moret: Yes, it is primarily structural. These aren't one-time things to address a particular year. The idea is that, the savings that we're making, the costs that we're reducing persist regardless of what the top line growth is going to be.\nJoe O'Dea: And then just one more on demand. I know a lot of focus on that already, but just trying to understand the past few months. When we look at the end market expectations, I think things came down in nearly every end market relative to three months ago. And so, trying to understand the degree to which things have gotten worse versus the degree to which things just aren't getting better quite as fast as you expected.\nBlake Moret: Yes, I think that latter is probably the best way to characterize it. We've seen sequential order growth quarter-on-quarter through the year and we expect it again in the fourth quarter and into next year, but it's at a more gradual pace.\nJoe O'Dea: Got it. Thanks a lot.\nAijana Zellner: All right. Thank you for joining us today, everyone. That concludes today's conference call.\nOperator: At this time, you may disconnect. Thank you.",

            "name": "Nick Gangestad",
            "content": "Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8, third quarter key financial information. Third quarter reported and organic sales were down 8.4% compared to last year. Acquisitions contributed 60 basis points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by 60 basis points. About 350 basis points of organic growth came from price this quarter. Segment operating margin was 20.8% compared to 21.1% a year ago. Margin performance in the quarter reflects lower sales volume and an unfavorable mix, largely offset by positive price cost, lower incentive compensation, and the benefits from cost reduction actions we announced on our last earnings call. Adjusted EPS of $2.71 was higher than expectations, driven by better revenue, mix, and savings from our cost actions. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was 13.3%, benefiting from discrete tax items and below the prior year rate. Free cash flow was $238 million compared to $240 million in the prior year. Our lower year-over-year free cash flow generation in the quarter was driven by lower pretax income, but was mostly offset by lower working capital, which improved for the second consecutive quarter, but at a slower rate than anticipated. One additional item not shown on the slide. We repurchased approximately 600,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $160 million. On June 30th, $500 million remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Intelligent Devices margin increased to 20.2% compared to 16.8% a year ago. The increase from the prior year was driven by positive price cost, lower incentive compensation, and our cost reduction actions, partially offset by lower sales volume. Software and control margin of 23.6% decreased from 34.8% last year. The lower margin was driven by lower sales volume, partially offset by positive price cost, lower incentive compensation, and our cost reduction actions. As Blake mentioned earlier, software and control margin exceeded our expectations this quarter with better performance in Logix sales. Lifecycle Services margin of 19.3% more than doubled from the year ago margin of 9.3%. The margin performance was driven by lower incentive compensation, higher sales, continued strong project execution, and ongoing savings from the prior year structural actions. Lifecycle Services book-to-bill was 1.0. The next, Slide 10 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q3 fiscal 2023 to Q3 fiscal 2024. Core performance was down $0.80 on an 8.4% organic sales decline. The EPS decline was driven by lower volume and unfavorable mix and was partially offset by positive price cost. Cost reduction actions contributed 30 cents to the year-over-year increase. Incentive compensation was a 40-cent tailwind. This year-over-year increase reflects no projected bonus payout this year versus an above-target payout last year. The dilution impact from acquisitions was $0.10, and currency was a $0.15 headwind. Share count, interest expense, and tax were a combined $0.05 cent tailwind. Let's now move on to the next Slide, 11, guidance for fiscal 2024. We are lowering our guidance for fiscal 2024. We now expect reported sales to decline by about 8.5% and organic sales to decline 10%. As Blake mentioned earlier, we continue to expect acquisitions to add 150 basis points to growth. And we now expect currency to be neutral for the year on continued strength in the U.S. dollar. We continue to expect price to be a positive contributor for the year. We now expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 16%. We are lowering our adjusted EPS guidance to $9.60, down 21% year-over-year. With lower sales, our improvements in inventory days will be delayed, and we now expect to end fiscal year 2024 with 160 days of inventory. As a result, we expect full-year free cash flow conversion of about 60% of adjusted income. Our free cash flow conversion for the year also reflects several non-recurring headwinds, including our second half restructuring actions, the timing of our cash bonus payout, and tax payments for both the TCJA transition tax and our prior year PTC gain. From a top-line perspective, we expect flat sequential sales in Q4 in each of our business segments. Sequentially, we expect margins in Q4 to be about 100 basis points lower than in Q3. By segment, we expect our Q4 margin in Intelligent Devices to decline about 100 basis points, and Lifecycle Services margin to decline about 200 basis points sequentially. In both segments, we expect the decline to be driven by a less favorable mix. We expect margin in software and control to be similar to Q3. A few additional comments on fiscal 2024 guidance. Corporate and other expense is still expected to be around $130 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 114.5 million shares. We still expect to deploy between $600 million and $800 million to share repurchases during the year. Net interest expense for fiscal 2024 is now expected to be $140 million. Before I pass it on to Blake, I'd like to talk about how actions we're taking this year are going to benefit our results in fiscal 2025 and beyond. As you heard earlier, we expect our productivity and margin expansion actions to provide about $250 million in year-over-year benefit next year. These are expected to offset compensation headwinds next year, which includes merit increases and the reinstatement of incentive compensation. The $250 million in benefits is split about equally between improvements in gross margin and reductions in SG&A. We expect R&D spending next year to remain similar as a percentage of sales as we continue to invest in areas of highest growth. With my upcoming retirement, I'd like to thank Blake for this opportunity and to thank all of you for your engagement over the last several years. Thank you. With that, I'll turn it over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Thanks, Scott. Scott the $250 million is exactly as you said, as a year-over-year benefit from the productivity and cost safe margin actions we're taking. We expect the bonus expense next year if we're delivering to plan to be between $160 million and $170 million. Other things on top of that where I'm saying it's largely being the $250 million in total cost and margin benefits are being largely offset by bonus and other compensation. I'm including our anticipated merit increase for fiscal year 2025 which will round that out to about $250 million when I add in the bonus. Is that clear, Scott? Hey, Andy. Yes, a couple things there, Andy. First of all, the mix between Q3 and Q4 on the $100 million of cost savings that we're expecting, that's shifted a little. I earlier had said one-third, two-thirds, it's now more like 40-60 between Q3 and Q4. We got some good progress in Q3, a little ahead, moving some of those actions earlier. So the differential isn't quite as big between Q3 and Q4 as what we thought three months ago. Now moving into margin and what we're expecting going into Q4 for margin. We had some things noticeably impact our margin better than what we were expecting in Q3. Primarily we guided in Q3 that we expected our -- in our software and control business, we expected a sequential decline of 20%, which would have -- what we said on our last call is that, we thought that would bring our margins in software and control down to the mid-teens. With the strength in the Logix, orders and sales that we saw in Q3, that did not materialize to that level. It ended up, rather than software and control being down 20%, it was down 10%. And that extra revenue and the mixed benefit that brings help boost the margins in software and control much higher than what we were estimating. And that's the primary driver of our over performance of margin in Q3. Now into Q4, we will be getting the benefit of these additional cost actions. In software and control, we don't see an additional ramp up happening in Q4 for our Logix sales. We think that'll be very, very similar to what we saw in Q3. In fact, we think what we saw in Q3 is going to be almost a carbon copy into Q4 from a revenue standpoint, from a margin standpoint for software and control. Intelligent Devices and Lifecycle Services, we expect for both of those a sequential decline. We had some -- both of those businesses had some favorable mix. Driven by, in Q3, we see some of that mix reversing into Q4. And in Lifecycle services, it's part of our customer and project mix that was very beneficial to us in Q3. We think that'll abate some in Q4 and why we see margins going down a couple hundred basis points sequentially. Still part of a more than doubling the margin for the full year than what we saw last year. And then Intelligent Devices, we see about 100 basis point drop in margin. That is also driven by some of our product and project mix there. Thanks, Jeff. Yes, our Lifecycle Services margin -- thanks for pointing that out. It certainly has been a noticeable improvement over fiscal year 2023 with our margins for the -- our estimate for the full year of more than doubling. A portion of that year-on-year improvement in the margin and in the margin you're seeing is coming from the absence of any kind of bonus or incentive compensation this year. The majority of our improvement is coming through better profitability in our Sensia joint venture. It's coming through structural productivity that we set in place late last year. It's coming through better project execution. Those aspects we think that will continue to build into fiscal year 2025. But I just will point out that the benefit from the incentive compensation, we expect that not to be repeated into fiscal year 2025. If incentive compensation were paid as per the plan, that would have reduced life cycle services margin for the full year by approximately 200 basis points. Yes, Nigel, a couple things to add. One is, yes, we do track the amount of new orders being placed on our distributors. And what we see there is, we are seeing that continuing to go up. But part of what we're highlighting in our revised estimate for Q4 is we're not seeing go up at the pace that we were expecting, implying that the end demand is not as robust as what we were thinking three months ago. And then in terms of your question about added visibility into 2025, I'm sure you were asking more about revenue, but I will just add from a margin perspective, what are some of the headwinds and tailwinds we're thinking about for margin next year? The headwinds we've talked about of compensation, both the bonus and our annual merit increase, and we expect to continue investments in new products and digital offerings. Tailwinds that we expect in our margin next year. That $250 million of margin expansion and cost reduction actions we think will be -- we know will be benefiting margin next year. We continue to expect positive price cost next year and then we expect continued margin improvement from our recent acquisitions in the last two or three and that coupled with, right now what's anticipated, no new M&A, we think that will also be marginally enhancing for us in 2025. Sure, Julian. Thanks for asking. So from an inventory standpoint, given where we have been in the last 2.5 years in terms of ensuring that our customers are getting the products they need. We have been very focused on making sure that we have the stock we need in place to be meeting our customers' requirements. As we went through the \u2013 our plans for fiscal year 2024, as we went through the year, is that we expected that in the second half of this year we would be seeing increased demand on us depleting quite a bit of that excess inventory that we ourselves are holding. As we're seeing the demand on us not having that ramp up, but more of this gradual increase that we're talking about, that's leaving us with noticeably more inventory in terms of days of inventory at the end of our fiscal year than what we were estimating earlier in the year or even three months ago. And that's the most significant part of our cash conversion story. In terms of our prior guide of 80% now bringing it down to 60%, we've known all along we have these one-time non-recurring headwinds, things like our extra tax payments that we'd be doing well in excess of our tax expense. We also knew that we'd be having the cash payments for our restructuring actions. So those things are contemplated as part of that 80%, but we were also counting on a noticeable roll down in that working capital and inventory in the second half of the year. And while it's still going to come down in the second half of the year, it's not going to come down nearly at the pace. That's really going to be more of a 2025 development for us. Yes. And then, Noah, as far as the quarterization or calendarization of the benefits of that $250 million. Well, first let me say, you are correct about the bonus, that that will be like largely equal throughout the four quarters of fiscal year 2025. But in terms of the calendarization, of course, we'll add that kind of information in the November meeting for more detail. That said, what I can tell you is the restructuring benefits are more front half loaded, the things that we started in Q3, whereas those additional margin expansion benefits that we talked about that go on top of that, that is more second half loaded. But the actual calendarization of all of this, we'll share more of that in November. Hey, Steve. Yes, and I think what I'll add to that, this $250 million that we're projecting for next year, that is roughly half of that that we see as benefiting gross margin and roughly half of that that we see reducing our SG&A spending. We're striving to keep our ongoing investments in R&D in light of the opportunities we see there as a percent of revenue relatively flat. Yeah The five I shared on Nigel's question, those are big five there. Yes, in the last two or three quarters, it's -- Steve, it's -- the inventory is in both the last two quarters not going up. They're just not coming down as fast as we thought. And we think that pace of it coming down will accelerate in 2025. But in terms of volume in our factories, in terms of a negative headwind from underutilization in 2025 versus 2024, we don't anticipate that's a material impact on fiscal year 2025. Thank you. Thanks, Joe. Joe, we're implying that Intelligent Devices revenue will be almost exactly the same sequentially between Q3 and Q4. It's not -- we're not expecting a noticeable uptick or downtick sequentially in intelligent devices revenue. Not a seasonal uptick there."

            "name": "Blake Moret",
            "content": "Thanks, Aijana. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we turn to our third quarter results, I'll make some initial comments. As we saw in Q2, operational performance continued to be strong in our third quarter, but order growth continued to ramp at a slower than expected pace. Our accelerated actions to bring costs in line with the lower outlook on current year orders contributed to the strong margin performance in the quarter, and we are well into the more comprehensive program to expand margins introduced during our Investor Day last November. We continue to expect savings of $100 million in the second half of this year from accelerated actions taken this fiscal year, which will create a good starting point for fiscal year 2025. Based on actions taken in the last 12 months, our worldwide headcount is down 6% since Q2, and most others who will be affected have been notified. We will see incremental savings of $120 million next year from these actions alone, plus a larger amount of additional savings from the more comprehensive program, as I'll discuss in a few minutes. We've announced our new CFO, Christian Roth, who starts in two weeks and is excited to begin. Christian brings a successful track record and will work with me and the rest of the team to combine market-beating growth and financial performance in a consistent longer-term model based on the targets introduced last November to create significant share owner value. Turning to specific results in the quarter, Q3 orders were up low single digits, both year-over-year and sequentially, with growth across all regions. However, while our distributors and machine builders are making progress on working down their excess inventory, their orders to us came in lower than expected in the quarter due to weaker end user demand. As a result, we are projecting a more gradual sequential order growth in Q4 and into fiscal year 2025 than we had previously expected. We had another quarter of strong execution with sales, margins, and EPS, all exceeding our expectations. Total and organic sales were down 8.4% versus prior year. Organic sales came in better than we expected, with strong backlog execution in our longer cycle businesses, including lifecycle services and the configured to order products in Intelligent Devices. Organic sales in our Intelligent Devices segment were down by about a point versus prior year. We continue to see a solid pipeline of projects across all product lines, including good opportunities involving Clearpath's auto mobile robots and cubic data center solutions. In software and control, organic sales declined over 31% year-over-year compared to 24% growth in Q3 of last year. Sales in this segment were still better than expected, driven by better Logix recovery as machine builders reduced their inventory. We also saw good growth in our software business, including both on-prem and cloud-native offerings. For example, in the quarter, we had over 150 new logos for a recently launched FactoryTalk optics portfolio. This reinforces the importance of continued investment in innovation and new product introduction as we continue to redeploy and prioritize our spend towards areas of highest growth and strategic importance. We've talked a lot about cost savings during this challenging year, but we're taking great care to preserve the investments that will enable us to continue to grow share. Lifecycle services had another strong quarter, with organic sales up over 11% year-over-year, driven by continued relative strength in process end markets and strong execution of our project backlog. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.0. We did see some additional project delays, especially affecting our solutions orders. Some manufacturing customers are taking a pause in making large capacity investments as they deal with slower consumer demand, high interest rates, and policy uncertainty around tax tariffs and stimulus incentives. Even so, our customers are still investing in their operational resilience, reflected by continued double-digit sales growth of our recurring managed services. Total ARR for the company was up a strong 17% this quarter. Segment margin of 20.8% and adjusted EPS of $2.71 were well above our expectations. We're making good progress on driving productivity across the enterprise and we are seeing the benefits of these actions with over $40 million of savings in Q3 alone. Turning to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q3 industry segment performance. Last quarter we talked about some project delays and end user CapEx slowdown in parts of our business, namely automotive and food and beverage. We saw project delays across a broader group of industries this quarter, which will impact our end market performance through the end of the fiscal year. Sales in our discrete industries were down high single digits versus prior year, with declines in auto and semi being partially offset by year-over-year growth in warehouse automation. Within discrete, automotive sales declined high teens versus prior year. Brand owners are delaying more EV programs as they continue to reassess their product strategy in light of slower consumer adoption and policy uncertainty in the U.S. Semiconductor sales were down high teens. We continue to see delays in new capacity builds and the associated tooling, due in part to questions about the timing and certainty of CHIPS funding disbursements. E-commerce and warehouse automation sales grew high teens versus prior year, led by strong double-digit growth in North America. We continue to see a broad-based recovery at our end-user and machine builder customer segments. Moving to hybrid, sales in this industry segment were down mid-teens, driven by year-over-year declines in food and beverage and Life Sciences. Food and beverage sales decreased mid-teens in the quarter. Producers in certain segments of the food and beverage market, like baking and snacks, are seeing inflationary headwinds as consumers shift from high-end brands to more affordable labels. We're seeing less greenfield activity, but we do continue to see high demand for software and services that optimize processes to increase efficiency. Life Sciences sales were down high teens. Similar to food and beverage, customers and Life Sciences are prioritizing investments in their operational resilience and infrastructure. In the quarter, we had important wins with two leading pharmaceutical companies. The Life Sciences of Merck in Darmstadt, Germany, which operates in the U.S. and Canada as Millipore Sigma, selected Rockwell to assess the company's current plant infrastructure and help enhance the digital connectivity and cybersecurity resilience of operational assets. Another important Q3 win in Life Sciences was with AstraZeneca. Together with our partner, Claroty, we're helping the customer identify and monitor plan assets, detect threats, and integrate internal services and systems to provide a comprehensive global cyber platform for all of their OT environments. Process sales were mixed across the individual vertical markets. Overall, sales were about flat year-over-year with growth in oil and gas and mining offset by declines in chemicals and metals. Oil and gas sales grew low single digits this quarter. Within this segment, our Sensia JV sales grew double digits versus prior year with good growth in process automation and digital solutions offerings. And while we continue to win business in the energy transition space, we did see some North America project push outs tied to customers wanting to understand potential policy changes that may occur after the U.S. elections in November. In mining, our sales increased high single digits versus prior year. Our growth in the quarter was driven by continued double digit growth in Latin America. Here, Rockwell was chosen to integrate an end-to-end solution for Vale's new processing plant. As this customer looks to increase production capacity, reduce water consumption, and enhance cybersecurity infrastructure. This is a great example of how Rockwell brings our hardware, software, and services together to deliver differentiated value for our end users. Let's turn to Slide 5 and our Q3 organic regional sales. The Americas continue to outperform the rest of the world with North America sales flat year-over-year in the quarter and Latin America sales up almost 19%. EMEA sales were down 28% with continued macroeconomic challenges across Germany, Italy and France, impacting end user demand. Despite these headwinds, we continue to make progress with our European machine builders to gain share in the end user market. In the quarter, IMA Group, an Italian-based leader in designing and developing packaging machines, has sold over a dozen machines equipped with our Rockwell platform. By recognizing the technical advantage of our motion control capabilities, coupled with the time to market provided by our integrated architecture solution, their end user, who's based in Germany, is now looking to adopt Rockwell as its preferred choice in all future commissions. Asia Pacific sales declined 22%. In addition to continued inventory de-stocking and economic challenges in China, we saw incremental headwinds from EV battery project delays in Korea this quarter. Moving to Slide 6 for a fiscal 2024 outlook. While our orders are improving sequentially, they're progressing at a more gradual pace than we anticipated. We believe this is largely tied to a pause in new capacity investments as manufacturers focus on cost control and operational efficiency, waiting for a potential reduction in interest rates and broader U.S. policy changes. Therefore, we're reducing our fiscal year 2024 guidance to reflect this gradual pace of orders growth. Taking into account our order progression through early August, we now expect Q4 orders to be up low single digits sequentially. With that, we expect our organic sales to decline 10% for the year. We continue to expect acquisitions to contribute about a point and a half of growth, and we expect currency to be about neutral for the year. Total ARR is expected to grow about 15% and will exceed 10% of total Rockwell sales this year. We now expect our segment margin to be slightly over 19% for the year. While this represents about a 200 basis point decrease versus last year. It also shows the improving resilience of our business model. Adjusted EPS is slated to decline 21% versus prior year. We expect free cash flow conversion of 60%. Nick will cover this in more detail in his section. Before I turn the call over to Nick, I'd like to spend a few moments on Slide 7 to discuss the progress we're making in setting the foundation for long-term productivity and margin expansion. We already talked about the accelerated actions we're taking in the second half of this fiscal year to drive efficiency and scale across our entire company, and we remain committed to delivering $100 million of savings this year and $120 million of incremental savings in fiscal year 2025, mainly targeted at reducing our SG&A spend. We will continue to optimize our general and administrative spend through a targeted approach, although the majority of additional productivity and margin expansion will be realized as a result of reductions in our cost of sales. As you can see from this chart, we expect to save another $130 million in fiscal year 2025 through additional margin expansion and productivity projects bring our total fiscal year 2025 year-over-year savings to roughly $250 million. You can see the broad list of actions and programs that are underway to realize these targets. These productivity projects include savings in the areas of product cost, indirect material, purchase services, logistics, manufacturing workflow, make or buy decisions, portfolio optimization through SKU reduction, and price. We look forward to our new CFO, Christian Roth's additional perspective as we maximize the effectiveness of this program in fiscal year 2025 and preserve it as a foundational part of our operating model going forward, regardless of the top-line growth in any particular year. Let me now turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q3 performance and financial outlook for fiscal 2024. Nick? Thanks, Nick. This will be Nick's last earnings call with us. I'd like to thank him again for his commitment to Rockwell's mission over the last few years. He's working closely with Christian for a smooth transition, and we wish Nick and his family the very best in retirement. Christian will join me in leading the fourth quarter earnings call and Investor Day in November. As always, Investor Day takes place during our Annual Automation Fair. Last year, over 8,500 customers, distributors, partners, and investors joined us in Boston. Registration opens tomorrow for the 2024 event in Anaheim, California, which takes place during the week of November 18. This year, the fair offers an expanded four days of show floor access, showcasing major new hardware, software, and services offerings. Rockwell's technology portfolio, domain expertise, and unmatched ecosystem uniquely position us to help customers in our home market of North America and around the world. We look forward to seeing you in Anaheim in just over three months. Aijana, we will now begin the Q&A session. Good morning. Scott, we're -- that's certainly the objective is to increase the conversion on incremental revenue. Last November we talked about 35% and we said that that wasn't going to be dependent on mid-single digit top line growth. So a little bit more aggressive stance there. We'll hold off before talking about exactly what we expect in terms of core conversion, but you can bet that that's on our mind to increase the incremental conversion on revenue. Thanks, Scott. Sure. Andy, for a little bit of context, we have talked in the third quarter about expecting mid-single digit sequential order growth. We've seen sequential order growth through the year, and we said, because we were continuing to see the impact of excess inventories at distributors and machine builders that was going to yield mid-single digit order growth. As that kind of merges with some weakening in end markets, that's where we saw the low single digit sequential orders growth in Q3. And we think that that continues. So rather than a one or two quarter sharper bounce back, We think this is going to continue to be a gradual recovery. Inventories are depleting, both at our distributors and our machine builders. But we have seen some weaker conditions in end markets. And I would characterize that in a couple of buckets. You see a couple that are affected by consumer demand, such as automotive, as consumers are going a little slower in a rush to EV. And you also see it in food and beverage and home and personal care. We see consumers, and you've heard this from the brand owners themselves, are going a little bit down brand as they're being more discriminating on what they pay for packaged goods. Then you also see some pressure based on policy uncertainty going forward. I would say semiconductor and questions about the disbursement of CHIPS and Science Act funds are weighing on semi manufacturers and then an energy transition. So in those broad buckets, that tempers our view on the good side, on the tailwind side, as we go into next year, we're going to be lapping some of the quarters that had the most significant -- that were more significantly impacted in this fiscal year by inventory. And there'll certainly be a lot less inventory at distributors and machine builders in Q1 of fiscal year 2025, for instance, than there was in Q1 of fiscal year 2024. Jeff, I'll offer some comments on that. I think to start with, what is largely back to normal is orders and sales of our products kind of coming back right on top of each other. So getting back to historical pre-COVID levels of book-and-bill. When you get an order for a drive or a Logix controller in the quarter, being able to ship it down and recognize the revenue in the same quarter. Back to very high percentage conversion, operational performance is good. Customers are looking for that material in about the same time frame that they were previously. So that's really good news and puts orders and shipments back very similar from quarter-to-quarter in terms of products. As we look at next year, we're going to be lapping some extremely low order rates. And so, beginning with the fourth quarter, as we start thinking about year-over-year rates again, you're going to see some big numbers in the fourth quarter and likely going into next year. And we do see continued investment. We talked about project delays, but we're winning projects as well. We are seeing the impact of higher than traditional levels of investment, despite the uncertainty for North American manufacturing plant. So I think looking at Q4 as a jumping off point is inevitable, but as we said, we expect continued gradual sequential increases into next year and then we'll certainly be given a lot more detail in November. There's certainly risk with that, Jeff, but there's also the amount of business that we didn't ship in the beginning of the year because there was inventory sitting at distributors and that was a meaningful number throughout the year and it's far less as we move into next year. So you get some tailwind from that. Yep. Thanks, Jeff. Yes, so our visibility into distributor stock is very clear for the distributors on our DMI program, which is 100% of the distributors in North America. And it's not all the way gone, but the vast majority of it has dissipated there. We see continuing stubborn inventory in China, and we'll call that out, and that's going to take a little while to get to the bottom of that, because if you think about it, what paces those inventory levels has a lot to do with the end market demand. And so, if that is weaker, then it's going to take longer to burn through that stock sitting on distributor shelves. But we have very clear visibility in the US where the vast majority of our business goes through distribution. I painted the picture in China and then we have a higher amount of direct business with machine builders in Europe, there it's basically talking with them about what their levels are. And we have consistent questions that we review with them on a monthly basis. We're confident it continues to go down, but it's not all the way there yet. So a couple of comments, and then I think Nick may provide some additional color. In the quarter, inventory reduced nicely at distributors. So tracking that, as I mentioned before, pretty explicitly with our DMI program, being able to look at the high runners, the A items, as well as the B and the C items, we saw an overall reduction of the inventory levels and through that -- first part of the year we saw positive year-over-year growth in shipments coming out of our distributors to the end users. So as we talked to them, they have been having a reasonably good year as they're shipping out, particularly to those end users where they're not dealing with higher stock at the machine builders. Yes, I mean the biggest contributor to the M&A this year is Clearpath and the mobile robots. That's project business. I mean those are fairly expensive sales. And so, it's going to be lumpy through the year. We're seeing very strong year-over-year growth overall for that business, but it's going to move around a little bit from month-to-month and quarter to quarter. We remain very optimistic and proud of the accomplishments of that acquisition as well as the verb on the cybersecurity side. Yes, so we did talk in the last quarter about some weaker CapEx spend, particularly in food and beverage and auto, around new capacity. We indicated that while, for instance, food and beverage customers are still investing in resilience and efficiency, they're pausing new capacity. And similarly -- and I think the well-read theme of EV slowing down a bit as well. We're still seeing projects and behavior that we would characterize as delays, push outs, but not cancellations. And we certainly hope that it doesn't move to that. We're watching it. We're taking a clear-eyed view of what's happening out there. But people are pushing for some of the reasons I mentioned before, as we said, looking at consumer demand, interest rates, and then some policy uncertainty. It doesn't all just stop until the elections, for instance. So we're going to see major projects that are awarded this quarter that are coming from customers across a variety of industries, but not at the pace that we would have thought, say, three or four months ago. And you're right. The dominant theme for the first part of this year was the inventory issue at distributors and machine builders. And now, as that dissipates, we're seeing some pause in capital spend in manufacturing. Yes, thanks. So I'll take the first one and then Nick will chime in on the calendarization of the cost actions. We haven't given a specific figure in terms of the inventory at distribution and machine builders, but it's hundreds of millions of dollars. And it's a larger factor, as I've said before, than some of the investments that we've seen in North America. So it's a bigger number than the business on the good side that's been won this year based on investment in North America. It's dissipating, we're seeing a smaller contribution in each quarter, but it's been stubborn. And as we said, we expect that there's not going to be one month all clear where suddenly it's gone. And that's why we say gradual sequential improvement in orders in this quarter and then into next year. Yep, thanks. Good morning. So I'll start with the general comment and then Nick can add detail. But you're right, Steve. The productivity that we're looking at, the combination of the actions that were primarily reductions in force on the second half of this year, and the items in the more comprehensive program offsets the headwinds from compensation into next year. We expect our R&D spend, which is part of that overall operating spend. If you add R&D and SG&A together, that's our operating spend. And we expect R&D to be roughly similar as a percentage of sales next year. Talk a little bit more about what you mean by overproduction, Steve. Joe, I'm going to stay away from bigger than a bread box type of dimensioning for next year. But the customers we're talking to, including in automotive and food and beverage, are continuing to make investments in those areas. We look at not just potential capacity that they're adding, but it's about resilience, efficiency in existing facilities. It's one of the things that excites us about the mobile robots, for instance, is that -- most of that's going into existing facilities. So customers, just like Rockwell, are working on their efficiency and their cost, regardless of what's going on in the external environment. And we're really well prepared to address that. So I mentioned before, as we start getting into -- back into year-over-year growth in orders, we'll characterize what that means for shipments into the next year, but I'm very confident with our position. Sure, Joe, broadly, we've spent a lot of the last few years adding some capabilities that I felt we needed to move faster in, things like software capability, high-value services like cybersecurity, and some particular technologies like mobile robots, independent car technology, industrial PCs. At the same time, we've been playing a lot of defense with COVID, with supply chain volatility that has introduced inevitably some inefficiencies into our own processes. And so for several reasons, now is the time to integrate the parts, to bring together the things that we built and bought over the last few years, and to drive out some of the inefficiency that's built up with programs like this. And it necessarily involves headcount reduction, as well as actions aimed at reducing our cost of goods sold. And so it's a broad-based approach that will yield benefits in this year as we talked about into next year. But then it gets rolled into a continuous operating model of continuous improvement that continues to drive these costs out and be vigilant to make sure that new costs don't creep in. The benefits, of course, are for an investor standpoint, expanding margins to go with the higher growth levels. For customers, there's also a benefit. Things that we're doing to reduce that long tail of SKUs can actually increase customer service for the more frequently bought items. And when we reduce the cost of goods sold, we have the opportunity to be even more competitive on the projects that we choose to go after. So for a variety of reasons, integrating the parts and driving inefficiency out is the right time in our journey to introduce this as we started last November at Investor Day and will certainly be given more of an update in just a few months. Yes, it is primarily structural. These aren't one-time things to address a particular year. The idea is that, the savings that we're making, the costs that we're reducing persist regardless of what the top line growth is going to be. Yes, I think that latter is probably the best way to characterize it. We've seen sequential order growth quarter-on-quarter through the year and we expect it again in the fourth quarter and into next year, but it's at a more gradual pace."

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations and Market Strategy. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead. \nAijana Zellner: Thank you, Julianne. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO.\n Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include and our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call.\n Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings.  \n So with that, I'll hand it over to Blake. \nBlake Moret: Thanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we turn to our second quarter results on Slide 3, I'll make some initial comments. At a high level, our performance in Q2 was good, but I am not happy with the reduced guidance for the full year. The impact of high inventory levels at machine builders is larger than we expected. Orders are still expected to return to year-over-year growth in Q3 and continued to increase during the year, but the slower ramp is impacting shipments for the second half.\n Consequently, here's what we are doing. We are accelerating actions to bring costs in line with the revised outlook on current year orders, aligned with the more comprehensive program to expand margins introduced during our Investor Day in November. We will save $100 million in the second half of this year from accelerated actions being taken now, creating a beneficial starting point for fiscal year '25. We will see incremental savings of $120 million next year from these actions alone plus a larger amount of additional savings from the more comprehensive program targeting sourcing, manufacturing and SG&A. And we will provide a more detailed view of this program on our next earnings call. \n We are improving our forecasting with new perspectives on the team, processes that include a deeper analysis of channel information and better decision support technology. I'm optimistic about our position when we exit fiscal year '24, regardless of next year's growth for several reasons. \n Rockwell has built an unmatched portfolio to meet the world's growing need for smart manufacturing. Our home market, North America is expected to grow faster than the worldwide PAM. We are winning major new business today with both our traditional offerings and new sources of value across discrete, hybrid and process industries. As we couple this with our focus on margin expansion through cost discipline, operational excellence and organic growth, we will achieve the longer-range targets introduced in November and create significant shareowner value.\n Turning to the quarter. As we indicate on Slide 3, we returned to good operational performance in the second quarter with both organic sales and adjusted EPS above our expectations. Sales of product, configured-to-order offerings, Software and Lifecycle Services were all at or above our forecast. In products, we converted incoming orders at a much higher level than in Q1, and we now have sufficient mix of safety stock in place to convert orders at the current level or higher through the balance of the fiscal year. \n We are essentially back to booking and billing product orders in the quarter they are received at pre-pandemic conversion rates. Our orders were up low double digits sequentially. With continued recovery across all business segments and regions, North America had the highest sequential increase in the quarter. Year-over-year, total sales were down 6.5% in the quarter based on an organic sales decline of 8% and 1.5 points of acquisition growth. \n In our Intelligent Devices segment, organic sales declined about 7.5% year-over-year. I'm pleased with our execution to meet our shipping commitments and build safety stock in the quarter for these products. We also continue to see strong performance from our recent Clearpath acquisition, with sales of autonomous mobile robots contributing almost 2.5 points to ITD growth in the quarter.  \n One notable Clearpath win this quarter was with the [ Hershey ] Company. The Hershey Company continues to advance digital capabilities to enhance agility and efficiency across its operations, including supply chain and manufacturing processes. As part of their efforts, Hershey has selected Auto Motors technology to improve productivity in both fulfillment and manufacturing operations. Q2 margin performance for Clearpath was also better than expected.\n Software & Control organic sales were down 23% versus prior year, largely as we expected. As you know, this segment is significantly impacted by difficult year-over-year comparables in our Logix business. In Q2 of last year, we had 42% growth in Software & Control. There are particularly high levels of these products in inventory at our machine builders. Despite this temporary correction, we are gaining Logix share and winning new business across our software and hardware offerings. \n I'm proud of the vitality of our product development here, demonstrated by recent organic product launches and partnerships with Microsoft and NVIDIA that are focused on specific customer use cases, especially those that will benefit from simulation and simplification using artificial intelligence. These partners recognize that machines and manufacturing processes represent an enormous largely untapped source of data, and petabytes of this data flow through our controllers. They also know we have the manufacturing domain expertise to select the best use cases for their technology. \n Lifecycle Services organic sales grew over 12% year-over-year and continue to outperform our expectations driven by strong process end markets. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.07, led by good order growth in our solutions and Sensia businesses. Our Sensia JV saw another quarter of over 25% year-over-year sales growth in Q2. The Lifecycle Services segment also continues to contribute strong growth from our high-value services, including cybersecurity, which saw orders growth of almost 50% in the quarter. We are making substantial progress to expand Lifecycle Services margin. We saw 16% margin in this quarter, and we're not done working on the performance of this business segment. \n Total ARR was up 20% again this quarter. We continue to see strong profitable recurring growth from both high-value services and software. Rockwell segment margin was 19%. This would have been about 17% without the reversal of the bonus accrual we recorded in the quarter. Adjusted EPS of $2.50 was above our expectations even after adjusting for the reversal of the bonus accrual. Nick will cover this in more detail later on the call. \n Let's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q2 industry segment performance. Sales in our discrete industries were down high teens versus prior year. The impact of high product inventory levels in the channel are most pronounced in our discrete and hybrid industry segments. Automotive, e-commerce and other warehouse automation sales were all impacted. Within discrete, automotive sales were down 20%. Much of this year-over-year weakness is driven by excess product inventory in our channel. However, we're also starting to see some impact on our fiscal '24 sales as customers take time to reevaluate the timing of their EV investments. While we are not seeing any EV or battery project cancellations, we are seeing pushouts of certain production start dates. \n As we've mentioned, given our strong installed base and expanded portfolio, Rockwell is well positioned with automotive customers, whether they are investing in electric vehicles or adding more hybrid options in the near term. They are all interested in increasing efficiency. In addition to our traditional sources of value, Clearpath autonomous mobile robots helped us secure over half a dozen wins with major brand owners and Tier 1 suppliers this quarter. Semiconductor sales declined 25% year-over-year with continued geopolitical pressures and a temporary oversupply of legacy chips weighing on semi customers' CapEx investments. \n Our sales in e-commerce and warehouse automation were down high teens this quarter. We did see an improvement in sequential growth and increased our full year sales outlook. We're rebuilding a strong warehouse pipeline with traditional retailers and global shipping and logistics customers.\n Turning to our hybrid sales. This industry segment was down mid-teens year-over-year. The weakness in this industry segment was led by food and beverage and home and personal care. Food and beverage sales declined 20% in the quarter, driven by slower activity at our packaging OEMs, who are still working through their excess inventory. There are also some signs of slower end user CapEx spend. Food and beverage end users are continuing to fund capacity expansion in emerging markets, like India and Southeast Asia, and modernization and resilience projects across their existing facilities. We had wins in the quarter, including the AMR project I mentioned earlier and cybersecurity projects at new customers.\n Life Sciences sales were down high single digits. Results in the quarter were mainly driven by project delays, especially in China. Outside of that region, we continue to expand our installed base with newer software and hardware offerings. One example of new value in this vertical was an important Q2 order with an innovative contract manufacturer, National Resilience, who selected Clearpath to provide a comprehensive AMR solution as they bring cell and gene therapies to market.\n Moving to Process. Our sales here grew high single digits year-over-year, supported by continued strength in oil and gas and mining. Oil and gas sales were up over 20% this quarter with continued momentum in energy transition projects. In Q2, we secured multiple decarbonization projects, including applications for carbon capture, storage and hydrogen. \n Let's turn to Slide 5 and our Q2 organic regional sales. The Americas continued to be our strongest region this year, with Latin America growing 8% versus prior year and North America organic sales down about 4% in the quarter. EMEA sales decreased 19% due to high machine builder inventory in Germany and Italy, particularly in consumer packaged goods. Asia Pacific sales declined 17% in the quarter, with sales in China down almost 30% versus prior year. We expect a combination of weaker market conditions and slower distributor destocking to continue to impact our China performance through the balance of this fiscal year.\n Moving to Slide 6 for our fiscal 2024 outlook. As I mentioned at an investor conference in March, while orders continue to increase sequentially from the trough in Q4 of last fiscal year, we have not yet seen the acceleration we expect once distributors and machine builders work through their excess inventory. The result is that some of the demand they are seeing does not translate to an equal amount of orders placed on Rockwell. I also said that if the pace of orders continued on its current trajectory, we would expect our full year 2024 financial results to track closer to the low end of both our organic growth and EPS range. \n Since then, we've seen lower-than-expected order activity. While distributors and machine builders are continuing to work through their excess inventory, we have underestimated the amount of overstock at our machine builders. Based on information received directly from our largest machine builders, our downward revision is based largely on the size of their inventory and the expected pace of the reduction resulting in a slower ramp of orders in the fiscal year. \n Again, we do expect to return to year-over-year growth in orders for the third quarter, and our updated forecast still implies sequential order growth in Q3 and Q4. We believe we are taking share in our major product lines globally and in the U.S. North America is our strongest market, and we are starting to see an increased order impact from customer mega projects as the year progresses. We now expect our full year orders to be down low single digits versus prior year. \n Based on our performance to date and the lower-than-expected order ramp, we are revising our fiscal '24 sales guidance range with organic sales projected to decline 7% at the midpoint, and we continue to expect acquisitions to contribute 1.5 points of growth. ARR is still expected to grow about 15%. Segment margin of 20% is now expected to decline versus prior year, which still implies an increase in the second half and specifically in fiscal Q4, driven by higher volume and the accelerated cost down actions I mentioned earlier. Nick will share additional detail in his section. Adjusted EPS is slated to decrease 13% year-over-year at the midpoint. \n We are increasing planned share repurchases to roughly double our original plan for the year, and we expect free cash flow conversion of 80%. This is a reduction from our prior guide, and Nick will cover this in more detail later. The reduced guide for the fiscal year only strengthens our commitment to building a strong foundation for future growth and profitability. The company-wide program to comprehensively take cost out of our products and operations will positively impact our results next year. Savings will be used to expand margins and reinvest to drive future growth. We will provide additional detail no later than the Q3 earnings call. Our intention is to manage our business segments for consistent forecastable performance. \n You've also seen the announcement of Nick's upcoming retirement. A search has been underway, and we expect to announce a new CFO in the coming months. Nick will be fully engaged in the transition to his successor. And he will now provide more detail on our Q2 performance and financial outlook for fiscal '24. \n Nick? \nNicholas Gangestad: Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. Although my family and I are excited about what comes next in retirement, my continued focus is on delivering our plans for this year and ensuring a smooth, seamless transition to a new CFO. \n I I'll start on Slide 7, second quarter key financial information. Second quarter reported sales were down 6.6% compared to last year. Q2 organic sales were down 8.1%, and acquisitions contributed 140 basis points to total growth. Currency translation increased sales by 10 basis points and about 150 basis points of our organic growth came from price, in line with our projections. Segment operating margin was 19% compared to 21.3% a year ago. This 230 basis point decrease reflects lower sales volume, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. \n Adjusted EPS of $2.50 was higher than expectations. Given our lowered outlook for fiscal '24, we did not accrue any bonus expense in Q2, and we reversed the prior quarter bonus accrual. This resulted in a total adjusted EPS benefit of approximately $0.30 in the quarter. Even without the bonus impact, our Q2 adjusted EPS was ahead of our expectation due to better-than-expected conversion of incoming orders into sales. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide.\n Adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter was 14.8% below the prior year rate. Free cash flow was $69 million compared to $156 million in the prior year. Our lower year-over-year free cash flow generation in the quarter was driven by lower pretax income and higher tax payments, partially offset by decreases in working capital. The increased tax payments relate to our gain on our sale of PTC shares in fiscal year '23 and our payments on the 2018 TCJA transition tax. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased approximately 700,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $195 million.\n On March 31, $600 million remained available under our repurchase authorization. \n Slide 8 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our 3 operating segments. Intelligent Devices margin decreased to 16.5% compared to 20.2% a year ago. The decrease from the prior year was driven by lower sales volume and unfavorable mix, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. Higher sequential margin was driven by better volume and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by mix. Software & Control margin of 25.7% decreased from 33.6% last year. The lower margin was driven by lower sales volume, partially offset by lower incentive compensation, positive price cost and favorable mix, driven by higher software sales. Higher sequential margin was driven by lower incentive compensation, partially offset by lower volume. \n Lifecycle Services margin of 16.6% tripled from a year ago margin of 5.5%. The margin performance was driven by lower incentive compensation, higher sales and higher margins in Sensia. Higher sequential margin was driven by volume, lower incentive compensation and ongoing improvements in productivity. Lifecycle Services book-to-bill was 1.07, indicating continued strength in underlying demand.\n The next Slide 9 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q2 fiscal '23 to Q2 fiscal '24. Core performance was down $1.15 on an 8% organic sales decline. The EPS decline was driven by lower volume and unfavorable mix and was partially offset by positive price/cost. Incentive compensation was a $0.55 tailwind. This year-over-year improvement reflects no projected bonus payout this year versus an above-target payout last year. The dilution impact from acquisitions was neutral due to better-than-expected profitability in Clearpath and Verve. The year-over-year impact from tax was a $0.10 tailwind. \n Let's now move on to the next Slide 10, guidance for fiscal '24. We are lowering our guidance for fiscal '24. We now expect reported sales to decline in the range of negative 6% to negative 4% and organic sales to decline in the range of negative 8% to negative 6%. As Blake mentioned earlier, we continue to expect acquisitions to add 150 basis points to growth. We now expect currency to contribute about 50 basis points to growth as we are seeing continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. \n We continue to expect price to be a positive contributor to growth for the year. We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. We are lowering our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $10 to $11. We now expect full year fiscal '24 free cash flow conversion of about 80% of adjusted income. The lowered expectations for free cash flow conversion is driven by the fact that the positive earnings impact from 0 incentive compensation recorded this fiscal year does not result in better cash generation this year. This is because the payout of any annual incentive compensation occurs in the first quarter of the following fiscal year. Therefore, we will see the benefit of this on our cash flow conversion in fiscal year '25. \n From an inventory standpoint, we continue to expect that inventory days on hand will drop by -- drop to 125 days by the end of fiscal year '24 compared to the 140 days of inventory we had at the end of fiscal year '23. From a calendarization perspective, we expect mid-single-digit sequential order growth in Q3 and high teens sequential order growth in Q4. We expect Q3 sales dollars and segment margin to be lower than Q2 levels. Now that we have largely cleared our product backlog, we are generating most of our product sales from new orders in the quarter, which are ramping up slower than we expected. We expect Q4 to be the highest revenue dollar and margin quarter of the year.\n From a sequential margin perspective, we expect margins in Q3 to be about 250 basis points lower than in Q2 due to the non-repeat of the bonus accrual reversal that benefited Q2, also lower volume and mix. By segment, we expect our Q3 margins to be up slightly in Intelligent Devices, down significantly in Software & Control due to lower Logix controller sales and flat in Lifecycle Services. As Blake mentioned, we are adjusting our spending level with the lower outlook for this fiscal year. \n Last quarter, we expected our full year '24 investment spending to increase by $60 million year-over-year or to be up about 2%. We now expect our full year spend to be down approximately $50 million versus prior year. This roughly $100 million spend reduction in the second half of fiscal '24 is driven by a combination of structural and temporary cost out actions, which will help protect our margins in the current fiscal year and will set the right foundation for fiscal year '25 and beyond. Some examples of temporary cost reductions items include not filling open positions, reducing contractor spend and further reducing our travel and marketing spend for the year.\n In terms of structural actions, we are expecting about $60 million of restructuring charges related to head count reductions in the second half of the fiscal year. The expected restructuring charges are excluded from our adjusted EPS. These savings and our continued cost structure optimization are aligned with our longer-term productivity focus and profitability targets. \n A few additional comments on fiscal '24 guidance. Corporate and other expense is now expected to be around $130 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 114.3 million shares. We expect to deploy between $600 million and $800 million to share repurchases during the year. This is an increase from our prior range of $300 million to $500 million and reflects a higher near-term prioritization of returning cash to shareholders versus acquisitions. Net interest expense for fiscal '24 is now expected to be about $135 million. \n With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. \nBlake Moret: Thanks, Nick. We are focused on getting synergies and efficiencies throughout the entire organization. The portfolio of capabilities that we have built and bought is second to none and now is the time to knit all these pieces together. This will help us drive more customer value, efficiency and cost savings, which in turn will yield higher margins and funds for reinvestment.\n Aijana will now begin the Q&A session. \nAijana Zellner: Thanks, Blake. We would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Julianne, let's take our first question. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Nick, congrats, and thanks for all your help. So Blake or Nick, could you give us more color into what's now embedded in terms of order trajectory in your $10 to $11 of guidance? Have you seen continued positive improvement in orders here to start Q3 because obviously, you still need a pretty big order step-up especially in Q4, as you said, given your guidance. And it's been difficult to tell for you, I think, how much excess inventory has been out there, especially with machine builders. So what are you doing to try and get better visibility into when they may bottom with their inventory and ultimately, you won't have to lower EPS again? \nBlake Moret: Sure. Andy, I'll start, and then Nick may have some additional comments. We're expecting mid-single digits sequential growth in Q3 on orders. This is after low double-digit sequential order growth that we saw in Q2. And then we expect high teens sequential orders growth in Q4. And that's based on our analysis of the levels of existing inventory in distribution as well as in the machine builders. For distribution, we expect that largely to clear by the end of the third quarter in most regions. China is probably an outlier that goes a little bit longer, but we're tracking those inventory levels and that's consistent with the direct feedback from those distributors. \n As we go out to the OEMs and have specific discussions with the largest OEMs, particularly in Europe and in North America, we're expecting that inventory to be largely cleared at the machine builders in Q4. This is imperfect because we have some of those machine builders that are buying direct from us, and then we have a lot better going through distribution. So that's still evolving. But we have much better view today than we did at the beginning of the year, and that's the primary reason for the reduced guidance for the year. \nNicholas Gangestad: Andy, one thing I'll just add on that. What we've seen in April orders is completely consistent with that. Our guide of an expectation of order growth of 5% sequential order growth. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Helpful, guys. And then, Blake, maybe just trying to step back and separate out the channel noise you've been seeing from the CapEx weakness you mentioned, for instance, in food and beverage. I know you mentioned you will achieve the long-term targets you said in November, but could you talk about your conviction at this point that Rock can resume that sort of 5% to 8% organic growth trajectory, ex acquisitions, sooner versus later. Can you give more color into the market share gains you mentioned North America, and which core end markets would you think would drive that back to that improved growth? \nBlake Moret: Sure. So we are confident that those growth ranges are reasonable as we look through the cycle. It's based on our offering. It's based on the higher growth that we see in North America, which, of course, is our home market, where most of our sales are, and it's our portfolio that we've built that's winning today in the market. So we see that through the individual projects that are competitive, the growing impact of mega projects. I and my team are directly involved with versus our toughest competitors around the world with a good win rate of those projects.\n We also see in the industries, the win rates looking good. And when I talk about market share gains, obviously, Logix controllers is one of the key areas, and we do see those gains, both when we look at the U.S. and when we look around the world in terms of the reports on that important product line, and there's some other areas as well, motor control centers, for instance, as we get those reports for our offering in North America, but also with the new Cubic offering, which is a space that was virtually unserved by us previously. \n And then with the autonomous mobile robots, you heard several examples of those wins in the production logistics space from our Clearpath acquisition, that's already a $5 billion or $6 billion market growing much faster than the general automation market. And so that gives us a lot of confidence with these new sources of value as well as the products that make up the majority of our business, we're confident about these long-term targets. And again, it's not just about the above-market growth. I think you've heard the tone on this call and in the last few months, putting that together with the margin expansion is absolutely fundamental to our plans going forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. \nNigel Coe: Nick, enjoy your retirement. So I'm just wondering if maybe you can get a bit more color on the kind of the third quarter color you provided. So the -- I mean I'm backing into an EPS close to the $2 per share for the third quarter. So I just want to make sure that aligns with your model. And then in terms of the order rates that you're pointing to mid-single-digit percentage increase sequentially, is that sort of back into like a $2 billion order number? Just trying to get a bit more quantification there, that would be great. \nNicholas Gangestad: Yes. Nigel, in terms of what you're backing into from an order rate in Q3, that's complete -- that's consistent with how we're seeing this, too. In terms of EPS, the one nuance I will point out from a quarterization on our tax rate, we expect our Q3 tax rate to be lower than the average and our Q4 tax rate to be higher than the average. That's just based on discrete items that are expected in the second half of the year and the timing. That's the only other nuance I'd say on this. But otherwise, I'd say your modeling is matching pretty closely what we're estimating. \nNigel Coe: Okay. That's helpful. And then on the cost savings, just on the $100 million of cost savings in the second half of this year, just want to make sure that, that doesn't include any of the bonus accrual reversals or the investment spending pullback. That's all sort of additional cost savings. It feels like it's mainly temporary costs in the back half of this year and then we have more structural costs coming in, in 2025. Is that the right way to think about it? \nBlake Moret: Let me start with some general comments, and then Nick can add some detail to that. The $100 million of savings that I mentioned for the second half of the year is totally separate from anything with the incentive comp. So that's additional savings that's totally separate from that. Embedded in that is a reduction in force of approximately 3%. So those are not temporary savings and that will provide additional incremental benefit into next year. There's also some of the temporary actions that Nick talked about, but there's a meaningful reduction in force that's structural and is the front end of the additional structural actions that I alluded to, and that we'll provide more detail on the next call. \nNicholas Gangestad: And Nigel, part of what we were talking about there is the $100 million we're expecting in the second half of this year. Those actions, we expect to have a tail into fiscal year '25 of an additional $120 million. So -- and I'm saying that in reference to your comment about temporary, some of it is temporary, but the majority of it is sustainable and carried makes that tailwind impact benefit into fiscal year '25. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. \nJulian Mitchell: Wish you all the best, Nick. Thank you for the help. Just maybe circling back on the sort of EPS walk. So you've got that very helpful, Slide 11, for example. But if I think about sort of 3 big buckets of costs you've talked about this morning, you've got incentive compensation, you've got investment spend, and you've got these fixed cost reductions relating to head count cuts. So it looks like for 2024, you've got about a $2 EPS tailwind year-on-year from incentive comp and investment spend combined. Is the right way to think about it that a lot of that reverses in 2025? And then on the other hand, you've got these savings that may be are worth about $1 of EPS from head count cuts in 2025. Just trying to understand of the incentive comp and investment spend, kind of how does that reverse in a substantial way kind of in the following year naturally? \nNicholas Gangestad: A couple of points, Julian. First of all, we certainly intend that the incentive compensation does reverse in fiscal year '25. But the productivity actions that we're doing with the structural cost savings, we do not expect the majority of that investment spend that I noted on that slide to reverse. And that's why we're talking about the $120 million of carryforward benefit into fiscal year '25. So 2 different answers. The incentive comp absolutely does reverse, but investment spend does not. And again, investment spend in total for next year will be dependent on the opportunities we're seeing. We haven't set what that number is. But the benefits of what we're doing here, we are confident that will create this $120 million tailwind benefit into next year? \nBlake Moret: Yes. Just at a high level, the actions that we're taking now with their benefit this year and then the incremental benefit next year, when you add that to the more structural actions that we're beginning a more comprehensive program that I mentioned, we expect that to more than offset the headwinds from returned incentive comp investment and so on as we go into fiscal year '25. \nJulian Mitchell: That's really helpful. And then just my follow-up would be trying to circle back to that point on sort of your revenues and your inventories and your customer inventory. So it sounds like you have this Q3 sales dip, I think, sequentially, Nick, you'd mentioned. Maybe help us understand why that's happening if orders are up sequentially in the second quarter finished and the third quarter that we're in now. And your own inventories on your balance sheet have been stuck at sort of the same dollar number for a year now. How are you so sure that your customers' inventories are coming down when your own are very stable? \nNicholas Gangestad: Yes. So as of the end of the second quarter, Julian, our product backlog is essentially back to normal. We've had good success working through with our supply chain, and we've brought our backlog back to normal. So going forward, our -- we expect to be operating what we were like pre pandemic, where orders in a particular quarter are very much like what our sales are in a particular quarter. In our second quarter, we were still benefiting from drawing down some of that backlog. We brought down our backlog in high single digits in the second quarter. And that's why our sales in second quarter were higher than our orders. That phenomenon will end going into the second half of the year. And that's why even though we expect orders to be up sequentially, we expect revenue to be down sequentially. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. \nNoah Kaye: Maybe talk about some of the choices you're making around where to reduce investments in the business. I would love any color. You made a lot of acquisitions. I'm not sure if it's related to that. Maybe you can talk about it if possible on the segment level or by protocol? \nBlake Moret: Sure. No, I'll make some comments, and Nick may have some additional ones. Most of the reduction in force that we're looking at is affecting SG&A and that does include sales and marketing and headquarter functions. I think as we look at guiding principles, we're directing the spend to the highest value activities that's both geographically and from a product portfolio standpoint going through and taking a look at what is generating the best returns in those areas. We're also integrating recent acquisitions with existing Rockwell resources and looking for the cost synergies there. So we're getting good performance out of our acquisitions. And as we look at ways to get the efficiencies and as I said, knit together what we've built and bought, the actions we're taking are consistent with that.\n And then there's opportunities, as always, for back-office efficiencies by leveraging technology. And we see that in SG&A. We see it in our development activities as well. There is some reductions in cost of sales, including some in manufacturing operations, as we're tuning our capacity to match what we're expecting near term in terms of output. And that's product-specific, right? Some of our lines are growing very well year-over-year, and they're expected to continue. Others as we've gotten back to full safety stock, we can tune that to reduce some of the variances in those operations. \n So that's the current list of actions that we're doing. As we look at the more comprehensive program, we'll be focusing on areas like sourcing is a big opportunity for us with the spend of direct material and other items. And then there's also additional opportunities for manufacturing efficiencies as we look at our portfolio and the wide range of SKUs that we offer. \n Nick? \nNicholas Gangestad: Yes. The one piece I'd add to that. Many of these costs are in organizations or functions that support multiple of our reporting segments. Given the way we allocate these costs across segments, Intelligent Devices and Software & Control will see the greatest impact from these actions that we're doing. \nNoah Kaye: Right. Makes sense. And then very helpful on the walk sequentially on orders and your commentary around margins for 3Q, that does seem to imply. Again, we're doing math here on the fly, a pretty big step-up sequentially in margin for 4Q. I'm getting to something like 6 points here. Maybe just talk to the margin math around how you see exiting the year and what, apart from the cost reductions you've announced, would help that step up? \nNicholas Gangestad: Yes. So there's a few things impacting our margin progression as we go through the second half of the year. And you are correct, and we expect Q4 to be, by far, our highest margin quarter of the 4 quarters. We -- the biggest contributor to that is going to be volume that is positively impacting the margin, particularly in Software & Control. That's followed by the structural and temporary cost savings that we're doing. And then the third is we will be having a more favorable mix of revenue that will be benefiting margins. So it's volume is the largest and then followed by the cost savings and then the mix, all contributing to that sequential improvement in margin in Q4. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. \nC. Stephen Tusa: When you talk about these investments, what's the trend on R&D this year relative to last year as a percentage of sales or on an absolute basis? \nNicholas Gangestad: Yes. Steve, R&D as a percent of revenue is going to be pretty consistent at 6% of revenue. As a percent of revenue, it's not really changing from last year. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Okay. And then I guess just more philosophically, thinking about the story, and I know you guys have talked about your business being more of an intellectual property business over time, certainly a part of the story at least. And I just -- what I struggle with a little bit higher level is whipping bonus accruals around basically altering investments based on near-term sales. I guess, that just seems juxtaposed with kind of an IP-type business. How do we have confidence that you're not rocking the boat with a lot of that core, where the technology comes from, that would be kind of my biggest concern longer term. How are you guys managing that? \nBlake Moret: Yes. Steve, this is Blake. As Nick said, our development expense remains at 6%. We continue to invest robustly in areas, like new product introduction, which is actually increasing over the last few years in terms of what we're delivering to the market, both in terms of the hardware products as well as new software as well. And so I think it would be incorrect to talk about whiplashing that piece of it. We're looking for efficiencies that are taking cost out that had built up over the last few years of volatility as we've gone from pandemic to supply chain shortages and making sure that we're tuned for growth going forward with that. \n The incentive comp philosophy hasn't changed there and that we operate in a pay-for-performance culture. We had great payouts last year because we performed really well with high teens top line growth and even better EPS. This is a year that is below expectations, and we're not paying a bonus, but it's going to come back, and that's the way we've operated for as long as I've been in the business. So in no way it implies some sort of short-term activity to manage results at the expense of the long-term value that we continue to provide. \nC. Stephen Tusa: And then just one last one on the 3Q to the 4Q. I know that the second half of this year was dependent on obviously the sales being there. I mean, how dependent are we from -- going from the 2-ish to 4 from 3Q to 4Q on sales actually being there? Is it the same kind of dynamic as we've been seeing -- we're seeing in 3Q, similar to the comments you made last quarter. \nNicholas Gangestad: Steve, the sales dynamic is the single biggest contributor to the increase in EPS from Q3 to Q4. Second -- followed second by on a smaller scale to cost actions. The total cost actions that we're projecting in the second half of the year, we expect about 1/3 of that to be impacting Q3 and about 2/3 of that to be impacting Q4. So there -- that is part of it, but it's still a smaller number compared to the reliance on revenue growth occurring in fourth quarter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Mason from Baird. \nRobert Mason: I wanted to see if you could provide a little more color around the step-up in orders that you're expecting -- sequential up in orders that you're expecting in the fourth quarter? I know you mentioned distributor channel inventories normalizing at that point. But is that the entirety of the high teens growth? Or are you expecting some shift in -- more positive shift in demand as well? \nBlake Moret: There's a few elements of what informs that guidance, Rob. But the first is a significant reduction in packaging machine builder inventory. So within the OEM inventory, packaging machinery has been particularly affected by that. And the feedback we're receiving from the conversations directly with them indicates that, that reduces significantly as we go through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. The distributor inventory actually is expected to clear again in regions outside of China before that. And so those 2 factors are an important part of it. We also see the normal seasonality in our engineered-to-order and Lifecycle Services shipments. There's always a higher shipment amount at the end of the year there, and that would include Sensia as well.\n And then we see the growing impact of mega projects. And we do have a line of sight to some of those projects that are expected to come in with ordering and shipments beginning in the fourth quarter. We're seeing some of that now. Think of that as kind of a drumbeat that increases through the year and again into next year. \nRobert Mason: Should we think about the fourth quarter order level as a solid jumping off point as we go into 2025 now, absent the engineered-to-order, normal seasonality there? \nBlake Moret: Yes. I mean in this volatility that we've been operating in, in the last 4 years, I'm going to reserve a view. But I think we're setting up the foundation so that we have an attractive cost base regardless of what orders do next year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. \nJoseph Ritchie: Nick, I wish you the best in retirement and then we're back and forth. Yes, so maybe -- can I just maybe just start on that last comment on mega project spending specifically. I'm trying to square the comments around EVs earlier and some pushouts. And if I think about where we're seeing the biggest kind of like expectation for mega project pickup would probably be in semi-fab CapEx? And then also on the like EV/battery plants. And so Help me just kind of square the comments on EV pushing out and where you're actually starting to see some kind of some good green shoots on the mega project side. \nBlake Moret: Yes. So I mentioned that we're seeing some push out on EV, but we are not seeing cancellations in those projects. And it doesn't mean that they've all gone away. EV is still about 1/3 -- a little bit more than 1/3 of our total automotive business. So there's still some of those projects -- EV projects that we're winning and getting business for now. If we look at some of the other areas of mega projects, the facilities management and control systems or semiconductor fabs. We've got great capabilities there and are playing a major role in a lot of the fabs that have been announced and are currently under construction in the U.S., but around the world, that's been a good business for us in Asia for over a decade. So it's not a new application for us. \n Renewables is another area that we're seeing a good investment playing in solar. We are  seeing meaningful business in solar as well as wind, particularly with our Cubic acquisition. And then another area that is, we think, has bottomed, and we're seeing an impressive funnel building is in the area of warehouse automation and really the overall space of production logistics. And again, I'll go back to the capabilities that we have that's somewhat unique with AMRs, the mobile robots, combined with the fixed automation that we've always had, we're tracking some major projects there, and we've had some wins, and I talked about some of them on the call.\n But to give you an example about how those are playing out. There are a couple of customers that we've talked to in the last couple of months that have come off of discussions with labor and have made it clear that they want to complement their people with technology to a greater extent over the next few years. And those have resulted in multimillion dollar wins for Rockwell as a result of moving more aggressively and to adding technology to complement their scarce resources. And so those are the kinds of examples of mega projects that are starting to come in. \nJoseph Ritchie: That's super helpful, Blake. And then -- and if I can maybe just make sure that I've got it totally squared for next year on the buckets of cost savings. So you mentioned $120 million for next year. We're going to get something more on the structural side. And then incentive comp goes to 0 this year. And so in a normal year, that would be like roughly basically about $120 million, $130 million headwind in a normal year. So is that just baselining it? Is that the right way to think about it? \nNicholas Gangestad: Joe, you got it all right, except for the last one, our normal bonus expenses in the $160 million to $170 million range. \nAijana Zellner: Julianne, we'll take one more question. \nOperator: Certainly. Our last question will come from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. \nJoseph O'Dea: Blake, when you talk about packaging, delivering better order activity from Q3 to Q4, just want to level set on to what  --  how that kind of sizes overall for the business. And so you're talking food and beverage and household and personal care, and we should be thinking about 25% of revenue that would be seeing that pick up? \nBlake Moret: Yes. Actually -- so if you think about those verticals and that's about the size of the overall verticals there, about 60% of our business in consumer packaged goods covered mainly by those 2 verticals is the OEMs, the machine builders. So that's the way you can kind of do the calculus of how much of that business has been suppressed by the higher inventory levels, and we're expecting that to be dissipating over the coming quarters. \nJoseph O'Dea: Got it. And then the bridge on sort of prior guide to revised guide and the core piece in the $3.75 sort of EPS impact on core, it looks like that could be something like a 60% to 70% decremental. And if that's the case, and we think about the flip side, do you think about sort of a reversal of these headwinds is translating to better incrementals than what you would traditionally think about sort of through a cycle, absent some of the temporary structural cost actions that are underway? \nNicholas Gangestad: Yes. When you strip out things like incentive compensation and what we're showing there from investment spend because those things would normally be part of what we talk about in terms of our incrementals and decrementals, but we stripped out those 2 details to give you more detail of the underlying moving parts in there. But there are many parts of our portfolio where incrementals and decrementals like that in that 60% range are certainly normal. They're normally offset by some degree of incentive compensation or investment spend though. \nBlake Moret: Yes. I think -- but directionally, I think you're right in that Logix, we've seen the biggest correction based on the really tough comps with the huge growth from last year. And as that comes back in, that hardware does have high incrementals and high decrementals. We've put a lot around it with annual recurring revenue and so on, which does help us and continues to grow. But there's no getting around that Logix is very profitable. We have high incrementals and high decrementals there. \nAijana Zellner: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. That concludes today's conference call. \nOperator: At this time, you may now disconnect. Thank you.",

            "content": "Thanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we turn to our second quarter results on Slide 3, I'll make some initial comments. At a high level, our performance in Q2 was good, but I am not happy with the reduced guidance for the full year. The impact of high inventory levels at machine builders is larger than we expected. Orders are still expected to return to year-over-year growth in Q3 and continued to increase during the year, but the slower ramp is impacting shipments for the second half.\n Consequently, here's what we are doing. We are accelerating actions to bring costs in line with the revised outlook on current year orders, aligned with the more comprehensive program to expand margins introduced during our Investor Day in November. We will save $100 million in the second half of this year from accelerated actions being taken now, creating a beneficial starting point for fiscal year '25. We will see incremental savings of $120 million next year from these actions alone plus a larger amount of additional savings from the more comprehensive program targeting sourcing, manufacturing and SG&A. And we will provide a more detailed view of this program on our next earnings call. \n We are improving our forecasting with new perspectives on the team, processes that include a deeper analysis of channel information and better decision support technology. I'm optimistic about our position when we exit fiscal year '24, regardless of next year's growth for several reasons. \n Rockwell has built an unmatched portfolio to meet the world's growing need for smart manufacturing. Our home market, North America is expected to grow faster than the worldwide PAM. We are winning major new business today with both our traditional offerings and new sources of value across discrete, hybrid and process industries. As we couple this with our focus on margin expansion through cost discipline, operational excellence and organic growth, we will achieve the longer-range targets introduced in November and create significant shareowner value.\n Turning to the quarter. As we indicate on Slide 3, we returned to good operational performance in the second quarter with both organic sales and adjusted EPS above our expectations. Sales of product, configured-to-order offerings, Software and Lifecycle Services were all at or above our forecast. In products, we converted incoming orders at a much higher level than in Q1, and we now have sufficient mix of safety stock in place to convert orders at the current level or higher through the balance of the fiscal year. \n We are essentially back to booking and billing product orders in the quarter they are received at pre-pandemic conversion rates. Our orders were up low double digits sequentially. With continued recovery across all business segments and regions, North America had the highest sequential increase in the quarter. Year-over-year, total sales were down 6.5% in the quarter based on an organic sales decline of 8% and 1.5 points of acquisition growth. \n In our Intelligent Devices segment, organic sales declined about 7.5% year-over-year. I'm pleased with our execution to meet our shipping commitments and build safety stock in the quarter for these products. We also continue to see strong performance from our recent Clearpath acquisition, with sales of autonomous mobile robots contributing almost 2.5 points to ITD growth in the quarter.  \n One notable Clearpath win this quarter was with the [ Hershey ] Company. The Hershey Company continues to advance digital capabilities to enhance agility and efficiency across its operations, including supply chain and manufacturing processes. As part of their efforts, Hershey has selected Auto Motors technology to improve productivity in both fulfillment and manufacturing operations. Q2 margin performance for Clearpath was also better than expected.\n Software & Control organic sales were down 23% versus prior year, largely as we expected. As you know, this segment is significantly impacted by difficult year-over-year comparables in our Logix business. In Q2 of last year, we had 42% growth in Software & Control. There are particularly high levels of these products in inventory at our machine builders. Despite this temporary correction, we are gaining Logix share and winning new business across our software and hardware offerings. \n I'm proud of the vitality of our product development here, demonstrated by recent organic product launches and partnerships with Microsoft and NVIDIA that are focused on specific customer use cases, especially those that will benefit from simulation and simplification using artificial intelligence. These partners recognize that machines and manufacturing processes represent an enormous largely untapped source of data, and petabytes of this data flow through our controllers. They also know we have the manufacturing domain expertise to select the best use cases for their technology. \n Lifecycle Services organic sales grew over 12% year-over-year and continue to outperform our expectations driven by strong process end markets. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.07, led by good order growth in our solutions and Sensia businesses. Our Sensia JV saw another quarter of over 25% year-over-year sales growth in Q2. The Lifecycle Services segment also continues to contribute strong growth from our high-value services, including cybersecurity, which saw orders growth of almost 50% in the quarter. We are making substantial progress to expand Lifecycle Services margin. We saw 16% margin in this quarter, and we're not done working on the performance of this business segment. \n Total ARR was up 20% again this quarter. We continue to see strong profitable recurring growth from both high-value services and software. Rockwell segment margin was 19%. This would have been about 17% without the reversal of the bonus accrual we recorded in the quarter. Adjusted EPS of $2.50 was above our expectations even after adjusting for the reversal of the bonus accrual. Nick will cover this in more detail later on the call. \n Let's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q2 industry segment performance. Sales in our discrete industries were down high teens versus prior year. The impact of high product inventory levels in the channel are most pronounced in our discrete and hybrid industry segments. Automotive, e-commerce and other warehouse automation sales were all impacted. Within discrete, automotive sales were down 20%. Much of this year-over-year weakness is driven by excess product inventory in our channel. However, we're also starting to see some impact on our fiscal '24 sales as customers take time to reevaluate the timing of their EV investments. While we are not seeing any EV or battery project cancellations, we are seeing pushouts of certain production start dates. \n As we've mentioned, given our strong installed base and expanded portfolio, Rockwell is well positioned with automotive customers, whether they are investing in electric vehicles or adding more hybrid options in the near term. They are all interested in increasing efficiency. In addition to our traditional sources of value, Clearpath autonomous mobile robots helped us secure over half a dozen wins with major brand owners and Tier 1 suppliers this quarter. Semiconductor sales declined 25% year-over-year with continued geopolitical pressures and a temporary oversupply of legacy chips weighing on semi customers' CapEx investments. \n Our sales in e-commerce and warehouse automation were down high teens this quarter. We did see an improvement in sequential growth and increased our full year sales outlook. We're rebuilding a strong warehouse pipeline with traditional retailers and global shipping and logistics customers.\n Turning to our hybrid sales. This industry segment was down mid-teens year-over-year. The weakness in this industry segment was led by food and beverage and home and personal care. Food and beverage sales declined 20% in the quarter, driven by slower activity at our packaging OEMs, who are still working through their excess inventory. There are also some signs of slower end user CapEx spend. Food and beverage end users are continuing to fund capacity expansion in emerging markets, like India and Southeast Asia, and modernization and resilience projects across their existing facilities. We had wins in the quarter, including the AMR project I mentioned earlier and cybersecurity projects at new customers.\n Life Sciences sales were down high single digits. Results in the quarter were mainly driven by project delays, especially in China. Outside of that region, we continue to expand our installed base with newer software and hardware offerings. One example of new value in this vertical was an important Q2 order with an innovative contract manufacturer, National Resilience, who selected Clearpath to provide a comprehensive AMR solution as they bring cell and gene therapies to market.\n Moving to Process. Our sales here grew high single digits year-over-year, supported by continued strength in oil and gas and mining. Oil and gas sales were up over 20% this quarter with continued momentum in energy transition projects. In Q2, we secured multiple decarbonization projects, including applications for carbon capture, storage and hydrogen. \n Let's turn to Slide 5 and our Q2 organic regional sales. The Americas continued to be our strongest region this year, with Latin America growing 8% versus prior year and North America organic sales down about 4% in the quarter. EMEA sales decreased 19% due to high machine builder inventory in Germany and Italy, particularly in consumer packaged goods. Asia Pacific sales declined 17% in the quarter, with sales in China down almost 30% versus prior year. We expect a combination of weaker market conditions and slower distributor destocking to continue to impact our China performance through the balance of this fiscal year.\n Moving to Slide 6 for our fiscal 2024 outlook. As I mentioned at an investor conference in March, while orders continue to increase sequentially from the trough in Q4 of last fiscal year, we have not yet seen the acceleration we expect once distributors and machine builders work through their excess inventory. The result is that some of the demand they are seeing does not translate to an equal amount of orders placed on Rockwell. I also said that if the pace of orders continued on its current trajectory, we would expect our full year 2024 financial results to track closer to the low end of both our organic growth and EPS range. \n Since then, we've seen lower-than-expected order activity. While distributors and machine builders are continuing to work through their excess inventory, we have underestimated the amount of overstock at our machine builders. Based on information received directly from our largest machine builders, our downward revision is based largely on the size of their inventory and the expected pace of the reduction resulting in a slower ramp of orders in the fiscal year. \n Again, we do expect to return to year-over-year growth in orders for the third quarter, and our updated forecast still implies sequential order growth in Q3 and Q4. We believe we are taking share in our major product lines globally and in the U.S. North America is our strongest market, and we are starting to see an increased order impact from customer mega projects as the year progresses. We now expect our full year orders to be down low single digits versus prior year. \n Based on our performance to date and the lower-than-expected order ramp, we are revising our fiscal '24 sales guidance range with organic sales projected to decline 7% at the midpoint, and we continue to expect acquisitions to contribute 1.5 points of growth. ARR is still expected to grow about 15%. Segment margin of 20% is now expected to decline versus prior year, which still implies an increase in the second half and specifically in fiscal Q4, driven by higher volume and the accelerated cost down actions I mentioned earlier. Nick will share additional detail in his section. Adjusted EPS is slated to decrease 13% year-over-year at the midpoint. \n We are increasing planned share repurchases to roughly double our original plan for the year, and we expect free cash flow conversion of 80%. This is a reduction from our prior guide, and Nick will cover this in more detail later. The reduced guide for the fiscal year only strengthens our commitment to building a strong foundation for future growth and profitability. The company-wide program to comprehensively take cost out of our products and operations will positively impact our results next year. Savings will be used to expand margins and reinvest to drive future growth. We will provide additional detail no later than the Q3 earnings call. Our intention is to manage our business segments for consistent forecastable performance. \n You've also seen the announcement of Nick's upcoming retirement. A search has been underway, and we expect to announce a new CFO in the coming months. Nick will be fully engaged in the transition to his successor. And he will now provide more detail on our Q2 performance and financial outlook for fiscal '24. \n Nick? Thanks, Nick. We are focused on getting synergies and efficiencies throughout the entire organization. The portfolio of capabilities that we have built and bought is second to none and now is the time to knit all these pieces together. This will help us drive more customer value, efficiency and cost savings, which in turn will yield higher margins and funds for reinvestment.\n Aijana will now begin the Q&A session. Sure. Andy, I'll start, and then Nick may have some additional comments. We're expecting mid-single digits sequential growth in Q3 on orders. This is after low double-digit sequential order growth that we saw in Q2. And then we expect high teens sequential orders growth in Q4. And that's based on our analysis of the levels of existing inventory in distribution as well as in the machine builders. For distribution, we expect that largely to clear by the end of the third quarter in most regions. China is probably an outlier that goes a little bit longer, but we're tracking those inventory levels and that's consistent with the direct feedback from those distributors. \n As we go out to the OEMs and have specific discussions with the largest OEMs, particularly in Europe and in North America, we're expecting that inventory to be largely cleared at the machine builders in Q4. This is imperfect because we have some of those machine builders that are buying direct from us, and then we have a lot better going through distribution. So that's still evolving. But we have much better view today than we did at the beginning of the year, and that's the primary reason for the reduced guidance for the year. Sure. So we are confident that those growth ranges are reasonable as we look through the cycle. It's based on our offering. It's based on the higher growth that we see in North America, which, of course, is our home market, where most of our sales are, and it's our portfolio that we've built that's winning today in the market. So we see that through the individual projects that are competitive, the growing impact of mega projects. I and my team are directly involved with versus our toughest competitors around the world with a good win rate of those projects.\n We also see in the industries, the win rates looking good. And when I talk about market share gains, obviously, Logix controllers is one of the key areas, and we do see those gains, both when we look at the U.S. and when we look around the world in terms of the reports on that important product line, and there's some other areas as well, motor control centers, for instance, as we get those reports for our offering in North America, but also with the new Cubic offering, which is a space that was virtually unserved by us previously. \n And then with the autonomous mobile robots, you heard several examples of those wins in the production logistics space from our Clearpath acquisition, that's already a $5 billion or $6 billion market growing much faster than the general automation market. And so that gives us a lot of confidence with these new sources of value as well as the products that make up the majority of our business, we're confident about these long-term targets. And again, it's not just about the above-market growth. I think you've heard the tone on this call and in the last few months, putting that together with the margin expansion is absolutely fundamental to our plans going forward. Let me start with some general comments, and then Nick can add some detail to that. The $100 million of savings that I mentioned for the second half of the year is totally separate from anything with the incentive comp. So that's additional savings that's totally separate from that. Embedded in that is a reduction in force of approximately 3%. So those are not temporary savings and that will provide additional incremental benefit into next year. There's also some of the temporary actions that Nick talked about, but there's a meaningful reduction in force that's structural and is the front end of the additional structural actions that I alluded to, and that we'll provide more detail on the next call. Yes. Just at a high level, the actions that we're taking now with their benefit this year and then the incremental benefit next year, when you add that to the more structural actions that we're beginning a more comprehensive program that I mentioned, we expect that to more than offset the headwinds from returned incentive comp investment and so on as we go into fiscal year '25. Sure. No, I'll make some comments, and Nick may have some additional ones. Most of the reduction in force that we're looking at is affecting SG&A and that does include sales and marketing and headquarter functions. I think as we look at guiding principles, we're directing the spend to the highest value activities that's both geographically and from a product portfolio standpoint going through and taking a look at what is generating the best returns in those areas. We're also integrating recent acquisitions with existing Rockwell resources and looking for the cost synergies there. So we're getting good performance out of our acquisitions. And as we look at ways to get the efficiencies and as I said, knit together what we've built and bought, the actions we're taking are consistent with that.\n And then there's opportunities, as always, for back-office efficiencies by leveraging technology. And we see that in SG&A. We see it in our development activities as well. There is some reductions in cost of sales, including some in manufacturing operations, as we're tuning our capacity to match what we're expecting near term in terms of output. And that's product-specific, right? Some of our lines are growing very well year-over-year, and they're expected to continue. Others as we've gotten back to full safety stock, we can tune that to reduce some of the variances in those operations. \n So that's the current list of actions that we're doing. As we look at the more comprehensive program, we'll be focusing on areas like sourcing is a big opportunity for us with the spend of direct material and other items. And then there's also additional opportunities for manufacturing efficiencies as we look at our portfolio and the wide range of SKUs that we offer. \n Nick? Yes. Steve, this is Blake. As Nick said, our development expense remains at 6%. We continue to invest robustly in areas, like new product introduction, which is actually increasing over the last few years in terms of what we're delivering to the market, both in terms of the hardware products as well as new software as well. And so I think it would be incorrect to talk about whiplashing that piece of it. We're looking for efficiencies that are taking cost out that had built up over the last few years of volatility as we've gone from pandemic to supply chain shortages and making sure that we're tuned for growth going forward with that. \n The incentive comp philosophy hasn't changed there and that we operate in a pay-for-performance culture. We had great payouts last year because we performed really well with high teens top line growth and even better EPS. This is a year that is below expectations, and we're not paying a bonus, but it's going to come back, and that's the way we've operated for as long as I've been in the business. So in no way it implies some sort of short-term activity to manage results at the expense of the long-term value that we continue to provide. There's a few elements of what informs that guidance, Rob. But the first is a significant reduction in packaging machine builder inventory. So within the OEM inventory, packaging machinery has been particularly affected by that. And the feedback we're receiving from the conversations directly with them indicates that, that reduces significantly as we go through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. The distributor inventory actually is expected to clear again in regions outside of China before that. And so those 2 factors are an important part of it. We also see the normal seasonality in our engineered-to-order and Lifecycle Services shipments. There's always a higher shipment amount at the end of the year there, and that would include Sensia as well.\n And then we see the growing impact of mega projects. And we do have a line of sight to some of those projects that are expected to come in with ordering and shipments beginning in the fourth quarter. We're seeing some of that now. Think of that as kind of a drumbeat that increases through the year and again into next year. Yes. I mean in this volatility that we've been operating in, in the last 4 years, I'm going to reserve a view. But I think we're setting up the foundation so that we have an attractive cost base regardless of what orders do next year. Yes. So I mentioned that we're seeing some push out on EV, but we are not seeing cancellations in those projects. And it doesn't mean that they've all gone away. EV is still about 1/3 -- a little bit more than 1/3 of our total automotive business. So there's still some of those projects -- EV projects that we're winning and getting business for now. If we look at some of the other areas of mega projects, the facilities management and control systems or semiconductor fabs. We've got great capabilities there and are playing a major role in a lot of the fabs that have been announced and are currently under construction in the U.S., but around the world, that's been a good business for us in Asia for over a decade. So it's not a new application for us. \n Renewables is another area that we're seeing a good investment playing in solar. We are  seeing meaningful business in solar as well as wind, particularly with our Cubic acquisition. And then another area that is, we think, has bottomed, and we're seeing an impressive funnel building is in the area of warehouse automation and really the overall space of production logistics. And again, I'll go back to the capabilities that we have that's somewhat unique with AMRs, the mobile robots, combined with the fixed automation that we've always had, we're tracking some major projects there, and we've had some wins, and I talked about some of them on the call.\n But to give you an example about how those are playing out. There are a couple of customers that we've talked to in the last couple of months that have come off of discussions with labor and have made it clear that they want to complement their people with technology to a greater extent over the next few years. And those have resulted in multimillion dollar wins for Rockwell as a result of moving more aggressively and to adding technology to complement their scarce resources. And so those are the kinds of examples of mega projects that are starting to come in. Yes. Actually -- so if you think about those verticals and that's about the size of the overall verticals there, about 60% of our business in consumer packaged goods covered mainly by those 2 verticals is the OEMs, the machine builders. So that's the way you can kind of do the calculus of how much of that business has been suppressed by the higher inventory levels, and we're expecting that to be dissipating over the coming quarters. Yes. I think -- but directionally, I think you're right in that Logix, we've seen the biggest correction based on the really tough comps with the huge growth from last year. And as that comes back in, that hardware does have high incrementals and high decrementals. We've put a lot around it with annual recurring revenue and so on, which does help us and continues to grow. But there's no getting around that Logix is very profitable. We have high incrementals and high decrementals there."

            "name": "Nicholas Gangestad",
            "content": "Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. Although my family and I are excited about what comes next in retirement, my continued focus is on delivering our plans for this year and ensuring a smooth, seamless transition to a new CFO. \n I I'll start on Slide 7, second quarter key financial information. Second quarter reported sales were down 6.6% compared to last year. Q2 organic sales were down 8.1%, and acquisitions contributed 140 basis points to total growth. Currency translation increased sales by 10 basis points and about 150 basis points of our organic growth came from price, in line with our projections. Segment operating margin was 19% compared to 21.3% a year ago. This 230 basis point decrease reflects lower sales volume, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. \n Adjusted EPS of $2.50 was higher than expectations. Given our lowered outlook for fiscal '24, we did not accrue any bonus expense in Q2, and we reversed the prior quarter bonus accrual. This resulted in a total adjusted EPS benefit of approximately $0.30 in the quarter. Even without the bonus impact, our Q2 adjusted EPS was ahead of our expectation due to better-than-expected conversion of incoming orders into sales. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide.\n Adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter was 14.8% below the prior year rate. Free cash flow was $69 million compared to $156 million in the prior year. Our lower year-over-year free cash flow generation in the quarter was driven by lower pretax income and higher tax payments, partially offset by decreases in working capital. The increased tax payments relate to our gain on our sale of PTC shares in fiscal year '23 and our payments on the 2018 TCJA transition tax. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased approximately 700,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $195 million.\n On March 31, $600 million remained available under our repurchase authorization. \n Slide 8 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our 3 operating segments. Intelligent Devices margin decreased to 16.5% compared to 20.2% a year ago. The decrease from the prior year was driven by lower sales volume and unfavorable mix, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. Higher sequential margin was driven by better volume and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by mix. Software & Control margin of 25.7% decreased from 33.6% last year. The lower margin was driven by lower sales volume, partially offset by lower incentive compensation, positive price cost and favorable mix, driven by higher software sales. Higher sequential margin was driven by lower incentive compensation, partially offset by lower volume. \n Lifecycle Services margin of 16.6% tripled from a year ago margin of 5.5%. The margin performance was driven by lower incentive compensation, higher sales and higher margins in Sensia. Higher sequential margin was driven by volume, lower incentive compensation and ongoing improvements in productivity. Lifecycle Services book-to-bill was 1.07, indicating continued strength in underlying demand.\n The next Slide 9 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q2 fiscal '23 to Q2 fiscal '24. Core performance was down $1.15 on an 8% organic sales decline. The EPS decline was driven by lower volume and unfavorable mix and was partially offset by positive price/cost. Incentive compensation was a $0.55 tailwind. This year-over-year improvement reflects no projected bonus payout this year versus an above-target payout last year. The dilution impact from acquisitions was neutral due to better-than-expected profitability in Clearpath and Verve. The year-over-year impact from tax was a $0.10 tailwind. \n Let's now move on to the next Slide 10, guidance for fiscal '24. We are lowering our guidance for fiscal '24. We now expect reported sales to decline in the range of negative 6% to negative 4% and organic sales to decline in the range of negative 8% to negative 6%. As Blake mentioned earlier, we continue to expect acquisitions to add 150 basis points to growth. We now expect currency to contribute about 50 basis points to growth as we are seeing continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. \n We continue to expect price to be a positive contributor to growth for the year. We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. We are lowering our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $10 to $11. We now expect full year fiscal '24 free cash flow conversion of about 80% of adjusted income. The lowered expectations for free cash flow conversion is driven by the fact that the positive earnings impact from 0 incentive compensation recorded this fiscal year does not result in better cash generation this year. This is because the payout of any annual incentive compensation occurs in the first quarter of the following fiscal year. Therefore, we will see the benefit of this on our cash flow conversion in fiscal year '25. \n From an inventory standpoint, we continue to expect that inventory days on hand will drop by -- drop to 125 days by the end of fiscal year '24 compared to the 140 days of inventory we had at the end of fiscal year '23. From a calendarization perspective, we expect mid-single-digit sequential order growth in Q3 and high teens sequential order growth in Q4. We expect Q3 sales dollars and segment margin to be lower than Q2 levels. Now that we have largely cleared our product backlog, we are generating most of our product sales from new orders in the quarter, which are ramping up slower than we expected. We expect Q4 to be the highest revenue dollar and margin quarter of the year.\n From a sequential margin perspective, we expect margins in Q3 to be about 250 basis points lower than in Q2 due to the non-repeat of the bonus accrual reversal that benefited Q2, also lower volume and mix. By segment, we expect our Q3 margins to be up slightly in Intelligent Devices, down significantly in Software & Control due to lower Logix controller sales and flat in Lifecycle Services. As Blake mentioned, we are adjusting our spending level with the lower outlook for this fiscal year. \n Last quarter, we expected our full year '24 investment spending to increase by $60 million year-over-year or to be up about 2%. We now expect our full year spend to be down approximately $50 million versus prior year. This roughly $100 million spend reduction in the second half of fiscal '24 is driven by a combination of structural and temporary cost out actions, which will help protect our margins in the current fiscal year and will set the right foundation for fiscal year '25 and beyond. Some examples of temporary cost reductions items include not filling open positions, reducing contractor spend and further reducing our travel and marketing spend for the year.\n In terms of structural actions, we are expecting about $60 million of restructuring charges related to head count reductions in the second half of the fiscal year. The expected restructuring charges are excluded from our adjusted EPS. These savings and our continued cost structure optimization are aligned with our longer-term productivity focus and profitability targets. \n A few additional comments on fiscal '24 guidance. Corporate and other expense is now expected to be around $130 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 114.3 million shares. We expect to deploy between $600 million and $800 million to share repurchases during the year. This is an increase from our prior range of $300 million to $500 million and reflects a higher near-term prioritization of returning cash to shareholders versus acquisitions. Net interest expense for fiscal '24 is now expected to be about $135 million. \n With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Andy, one thing I'll just add on that. What we've seen in April orders is completely consistent with that. Our guide of an expectation of order growth of 5% sequential order growth. Yes. Nigel, in terms of what you're backing into from an order rate in Q3, that's complete -- that's consistent with how we're seeing this, too. In terms of EPS, the one nuance I will point out from a quarterization on our tax rate, we expect our Q3 tax rate to be lower than the average and our Q4 tax rate to be higher than the average. That's just based on discrete items that are expected in the second half of the year and the timing. That's the only other nuance I'd say on this. But otherwise, I'd say your modeling is matching pretty closely what we're estimating. And Nigel, part of what we were talking about there is the $100 million we're expecting in the second half of this year. Those actions, we expect to have a tail into fiscal year '25 of an additional $120 million. So -- and I'm saying that in reference to your comment about temporary, some of it is temporary, but the majority of it is sustainable and carried makes that tailwind impact benefit into fiscal year '25. A couple of points, Julian. First of all, we certainly intend that the incentive compensation does reverse in fiscal year '25. But the productivity actions that we're doing with the structural cost savings, we do not expect the majority of that investment spend that I noted on that slide to reverse. And that's why we're talking about the $120 million of carryforward benefit into fiscal year '25. So 2 different answers. The incentive comp absolutely does reverse, but investment spend does not. And again, investment spend in total for next year will be dependent on the opportunities we're seeing. We haven't set what that number is. But the benefits of what we're doing here, we are confident that will create this $120 million tailwind benefit into next year? Yes. So as of the end of the second quarter, Julian, our product backlog is essentially back to normal. We've had good success working through with our supply chain, and we've brought our backlog back to normal. So going forward, our -- we expect to be operating what we were like pre pandemic, where orders in a particular quarter are very much like what our sales are in a particular quarter. In our second quarter, we were still benefiting from drawing down some of that backlog. We brought down our backlog in high single digits in the second quarter. And that's why our sales in second quarter were higher than our orders. That phenomenon will end going into the second half of the year. And that's why even though we expect orders to be up sequentially, we expect revenue to be down sequentially. Yes. The one piece I'd add to that. Many of these costs are in organizations or functions that support multiple of our reporting segments. Given the way we allocate these costs across segments, Intelligent Devices and Software & Control will see the greatest impact from these actions that we're doing. Yes. So there's a few things impacting our margin progression as we go through the second half of the year. And you are correct, and we expect Q4 to be, by far, our highest margin quarter of the 4 quarters. We -- the biggest contributor to that is going to be volume that is positively impacting the margin, particularly in Software & Control. That's followed by the structural and temporary cost savings that we're doing. And then the third is we will be having a more favorable mix of revenue that will be benefiting margins. So it's volume is the largest and then followed by the cost savings and then the mix, all contributing to that sequential improvement in margin in Q4. Yes. Steve, R&D as a percent of revenue is going to be pretty consistent at 6% of revenue. As a percent of revenue, it's not really changing from last year. Steve, the sales dynamic is the single biggest contributor to the increase in EPS from Q3 to Q4. Second -- followed second by on a smaller scale to cost actions. The total cost actions that we're projecting in the second half of the year, we expect about 1/3 of that to be impacting Q3 and about 2/3 of that to be impacting Q4. So there -- that is part of it, but it's still a smaller number compared to the reliance on revenue growth occurring in fourth quarter. Joe, you got it all right, except for the last one, our normal bonus expenses in the $160 million to $170 million range. Yes. When you strip out things like incentive compensation and what we're showing there from investment spend because those things would normally be part of what we talk about in terms of our incrementals and decrementals, but we stripped out those 2 details to give you more detail of the underlying moving parts in there. But there are many parts of our portfolio where incrementals and decrementals like that in that 60% range are certainly normal. They're normally offset by some degree of incentive compensation or investment spend though."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include, and our call today will reference, non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So, with that, I'll hand it over to Blake.\nBlake Moret: Thanks Aijana and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our first quarter results on Slide 3. This quarter, we saw double-digit sequential growth in orders, with all business segments and regions up from the trough in Q4 of last year. While we are continuing to see the impact of excess inventory in the channel, the underlying demand from machine builders and end-users remain strong. Total sales were up 3.6% year-over-year. Organic sales grew 1% in the quarter, led by North America. China was the single largest drag on our shipments. Currency translation increased sales by over 1 point, and acquisitions contributed almost 1.5 points of growth. Our organic sales did come in below our expectations, largely due to the timing of our recovery to a more normal product book-and-bill process. As a source of our demand shifts from older backlog to new orders that need to be shipped as soon as they are received, we are working through some lingering shortages and line constraints. Our supply chain team is expected to complete this transition in Q2 with little impact on the full year. In our Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales were down 4.5% versus prior year. While product shipments in this segment experienced the biggest supply chain constraints in the quarter, we were able to offset some of that impact with strong performance from our configure-to-order businesses and from recent acquisitions. Our Clearpath and CUBIC acquisitions had a strong quarter, both on topline and bottom-line, showcasing the tremendous value these offerings are bringing to our customers across new verticals and applications. Last quarter, I talked about our presence in datacenter build-outs and CUBIC's momentum with large cloud service providers continues to fuel our growth in this end-market. I'll touch on some of the important Clearpath wins later on the call. Software & Control organic sales increased 4% year-over-year and were in line with our expectations. Logix continues to demonstrate unique value in the marketplace, and we've made some major software investments in this segment over the last few years. We are seeing the value from this innovation, demonstrated by double-digit sales growth in our cloud-native and on-prem information software offerings. Lifecycle Services organic sales grew over 8% versus prior year, better than we expected. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.13, with strong order activity across solutions, services, and our Sensia joint venture. I'm pleased with how our Sensia team is making progress, with profitable growth in the quarter. Q1 orders and sales were up over 25% year-over-year. One of the strategic Sensia wins this quarter was with Mellitah Oil & Gas joint venture, one of the largest oil and gas companies in Libya. Sensia's advanced measurement technology is helping this customer modernize all of their liquid metering skids and establishes Sensia as one of the key players in the region for major metering turnkey solutions. Another highlight of the quarter was our continued growth in ARR. Total annual recurring revenue was up 20% year-over-year, with strong growth across our Plex and Fiix SaaS offerings and recurring services, including our growing cybersecurity business. The impact of these contracts on our financial performance is also increasing, especially in a year with relatively low product growth. This quarter, our Plex SaaS platform was selected by EOS Energy, an energy start-up focused on grid scale storage for utility companies. EOS Energy, in partnership with Acro Automation Systems, has selected Rockwell Automation to provide Plex MES and QMS information software to compliment Acro\u2019s battery manufacturing solution built on Rockwell\u2019s control platform. Acro is currently building out the first state-of-the-art manufacturing line that will manufacture EOS Energy\u2019s next gen Z3 batteries. Segment margin of about 17% and adjusted EPS of $2.04 were both down versus prior year. The adjusted EPS was below our expectations, and Nick will discuss this further in a few minutes. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q1 industry segment performance. Before we get into the individual verticals, keep in mind that the more product-intensive industries were the most impacted by planned shipments moving to Q2 and later in the year. Our discrete sales were down 10% year-over-year. Within discrete, automotive sales were down high single-digits. While auto customers are focused on near-term profitability and temporary slowdown in EV demand, they continue to fund new EV and battery CapEx programs. In addition to these investments, we are seeing increased activity across our traditional ICE and plugin hybrid platforms as brand owners and tier suppliers are looking to diversify their exposure in response to consumer demand and infrastructure limitations. As you know, Rockwell has a substantial installed base with these established automotive customers, and is well positioned to capture additional market share, regardless of the application. This quarter, our Logix platform was selected by Akasol/Borg Warner, a global battery producer and automotive tier supplier developing innovative battery manufacturing processes for their production plants in Seneca, South Carolina and Darmstadt, Germany. This customer plans to increase their production volume in Europe and North America and scale to more plants globally. Another exciting automotive win this quarter came from Clearpath Robotics, where a large brand owner will be using over a hundred of our Otto autonomous mobile robots in their US sub-assembly applications. Semiconductor sales were also down high-single-digits versus prior year. While the industry is still navigating through a myriad of challenges, including geopolitical risk, excess memory capacity, and workforce shortages, we continue to see new announcements and orders for greenfield projects and legacy fab upgrades, along with continued momentum in our wafer transport solutions. Within our eCommerce and Warehouse Automation industry, sales declined mid-teens and were in line with our expectations. Customers across many verticals continue to modernize their existing operations to match the current market\u2019s needs. In addition to a strong funnel of these warehouse transformation projects, we are starting to see renewed CapEx plans from our eCommerce customers for fulfilment center builds later in fiscal year 2024 and in fiscal year 2025. Moving to our hybrid industries. Within this industry segment, growth in life sciences and tire were offset by declines in food and beverage. Food and beverage sales were down high-single-digits versus prior year. Given the mix of products serving this customer segment, our Q1 performance in this vertical was most impacted by our internal capacity constraints mentioned earlier on the call. Similar to previous quarters, we continue to see large end users investing their digital and cyber capabilities across their global footprint. This quarter, we had another sizeable Clearpath win at one of the largest food and beverage manufacturers in the world, where the customer chose our Otto AMRs to replace their existing AGV system to increase throughput and flexibility, while enhancing material movement security. It is clear our customers across many industries are focused on augmenting their existing workforce through autonomous and innovative solutions to drive further productivity, safety, and sustainability in their operations. Life sciences sales grew 10% in the quarter. Note that our life sciences revenue is more weighted to software and services versus products. In addition to our MES and cybersecurity services momentum, we are continuing to see increased investments in high-growth areas, such as Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products and GLP-1 diabetes and obesity drugs. Tire was up high-single-digits. Moving to process. Sales in this industry segment grew over 10% year-over-year, once again led by strong growth in oil and gas, metals, and mining. Oil and gas sales were up over 25% this quarter. I already mentioned our performance in Sensia, and we continue to see follow-on orders from our customers\u2019 decarbonization and digitization projects worldwide. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 5 and our Q1 organic regional sales. North America organic sales were up over 4% year-over-year. North American manufacturers are continuing to invest, and we expect this region to be our strongest-performing market this year. Latin America was down half a point. EMEA sales were down about 2%, and Asia Pacific sales declined over 7%. Similar to the last few quarters, we continue to see challenges in the Chinese manufacturing economy, with high cancellations and pushouts relative to the rest of the world. Sales in China were down high teens versus prior year. Moving to Slide 6 for our fiscal 2024 outlook. We continue to expect our full-year orders to grow low-single-digits versus prior year, with strong sequential growth through the balance of this fiscal year. Factoring in our performance through January, our continuous analysis of distributor inventory levels, and strong pipeline of customer projects, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2024 sales guidance range with organic sales projected to grow 1% at the midpoint. Currency is also expected to increase sales by 1%, and we now expect acquisitions to contribute a 1.5 of growth. ARR is still slated to grow about 15%. Segment margin is expected to increase slightly versus prior year, with significant second half increases coming from increased product volume, spending discipline, and the growing benefit of productivity initiatives being taken in Lifecycle Services. Nick will share additional calendarization detail in his section. Adjusted EPS is slated to grow 5% year-over-year at the midpoint, again weighted to the back half of the year, and we still expect Free Cash Flow conversion of 100%. Let me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q1 performance and financial outlook for fiscal 2024. Nick?\nNick Gangestad: Thank you, Blake and good morning everyone. I'll start on Slide 7, first quarter key financial information. First quarter reported sales were up 3.6% over last year. Q1 organic sales were up 1%, and acquisitions contributed 140 basis points to total growth. Currency translation increased sales by 120 basis points. About 3 points of our organic growth came from price, in line with our expectations. Segment operating margin was 17.3%, compared to 20.2% a year ago. This 290 basis point decrease reflects higher investment spend, mix between products and solutions, and lower supply chain utilization. While our Q1 spend was down sequentially, we had a difficult year-over-year comparison due to an abnormally low investment spend in Q1 of last year. Key areas of year-over-year spending increases include investments in new products, digital infrastructure, and commercial resources. I'll comment later on the expected progression of our investment spend when I cover our full year outlook. As Blake mentioned, orders inflected upward sequentially, and we expect strong sequential order growth through the remainder of the year. The expected slope of orders is consistent with what we have discussed over the last couple of quarters. Adjusted EPS of $2.04, down 17% compared to last year, was below our expectations, primarily due to lower-than-expected sales and lower segment operating margin. The devaluation of the Argentine peso was an additional $0.10 adjusted EPS headwind in Q1. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 18%, slightly above the prior year rate. Free cash flow was negative $35 million, compared to a positive $42 million in the prior year. Our lower year-over-year free cash flow generation in the quarter was driven by higher incentive compensation payout during the quarter, which was tied to our fiscal 2023 performance. Working capital decreased in Q1, driven by lower accounts receivable, partially offset by lower accounts payable. One additional item not shown on the slide. We repurchased approximately 400,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $120 million. On December 31st, $800 million remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 8 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Blake discussed our top line performance in the quarter, so I'll focus on our margin performance. As I mentioned earlier, our investment spend in the year-ago quarter was lower than normal as most of the incremental fiscal 2023 investments started in Q2 of last year. This resulted in a difficult year-over-year margin comparison in Q1 for both Intelligent Devices and Software & Control. Intelligent Devices margin decreased to 16.2%, compared to 22.4% a year ago. The decrease from prior year was driven by lower sales volume, the timing of prior year investment spend, and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by positive price/cost. Our Clearpath and CUBIC acquisitions, both part of Intelligent Devices, are performing well and are making commercial -- and we are making commercial and technical investments here to accelerate profitable growth. Software & Control margin of 25% decreased from 29.2% last year. The lower margin was driven by the timing of prior year investment spend and lower supply chain utilization, partially offset by price/cost. Lifecycle Services book-to-bill was 1.13. Lifecycle Services margin of 10.4% doubled from the year-ago margin of 5.2%. Strong margin performance was driven by higher sales, lower incentive compensation, and higher margins in Sensia. We are realizing productivity benefits from Lifecycle Services restructuring actions we took last year and those benefits are coming in as expected. The next slide, 9, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q1 fiscal 2023 to Q1 fiscal 2024. Core performance was down $0.10 on a 1% organic sales increase as positive price/cost was more than offset by negative product mix and lower supply chain utilization. Higher investment spend was a $0.40 EPS headwind. Incentive compensation was a $0.20 tailwind. This year-over-year improvement reflects a lower projected bonus payout this year versus an above-target payout last year. The impact from acquisitions was a $0.10 headwind and aligned with our expectations. The year-over-year impact from currency was a $0.05 headwind, with the $0.10 headwind from the Argentine peso revaluation more than offsetting the positive impact from other currencies. The $0.05 -- the net $0.05 currency headwind was offset by a $0.05 tailwind from interest expense. Share count and tax rate were each immaterial to the year-over-year change in EPS this quarter. Let's now move on to the next slide, 10, guidance for fiscal 2024. We are reaffirming our guidance for fiscal 2024 of reported sales growth of 0.5% to 6.5%, and organic sales growth in the range of negative 2% to positive 4%. As Blake mentioned earlier, we now expect acquisitions to add 150 basis points to growth, up from 100 basis points in our prior guidance, as the growing pipeline of projects from Clearpath is leading to higher expected growth. Given this improvement, Clearpath is now expected to dilute adjusted EPS by $0.20 versus our prior expectation of $0.25. We now expect a full year currency tailwind of 100 basis points, down from 150 basis points in our prior guide because projections for the euro and the Canadian dollar have weakened slightly for the year. We continue to expect price to be a positive contributor to growth for the year. We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. And we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance range of $12 to $13.50. We expect full year fiscal 2024 free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. This reflects our continued expectation that inventory days on hand will drop to approximately 125 days by the end of fiscal year 2024, compared to 140 days of inventory we had at the end of fiscal year 2023. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the first half to be well below 100%, mostly tied to the higher incentive compensation payment made in Q1 relative to our fiscal year 2023 performance, and higher income tax payments related to the realized capital gain on the sale of our stake in PTC, as well as our Tax Cuts and Jobs Act transition tax payment. From a calendarization perspective, we expect Q2 sales dollars and segment margin to be similar to Q1 levels. We previously expected the lead-times on our last constrained products would return to normal by the end of Q1. This is now being pushed back to the middle of the year. This means that our split between first half and second half revenue will be even more weighted towards the second half. Our plan was and continues to be for balanced spend across the four quarters of fiscal year 2024, compared to our upward trajectory of spend in fiscal year 2023, as confidence in supply chain recovery pace grew. Given the split of sales between first and second half, that means first half margins will be noticeably lower compared to the year prior and second half margins noticeably higher. We expect margins in Q2 to remain similar to what they were in Q1 and then increase to the mid-20s in Q3 and Q4. That expansion in margin is virtually all -- driven virtually all by revenue returning to levels consistent with end demand. We anticipate investment spend to be relatively flat across the four quarters of fiscal year 2024. From a year-on-year perspective, Q2 and Q3 increases in investment spend will be approximately $10 million each and then a year-over-year decrease in Q4. A few additional comments on fiscal 2024 guidance. Corporate and other expense is expected to be around $125 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2024 is expected to be about $120 million and we're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.1 million shares. We expect to deploy between $300 million and $500 million to share repurchases during the year. With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake?\nBlake Moret: Thanks Nick. Despite geopolitical volatility, our detailed discussions with our distributors, machine builders, and end-users point to fairly healthy market conditions. Our outlook for fiscal year 2024 is based on an acceleration of new product orders as distributors and machine builders reduce excessive inventory. Our operations team is working around the clock to ensure we can convert these new orders into shipments at lead-times that are as good or better than pre-pandemic lead-times. We continue to gain share across our key platforms, especially here in North America. We are seeing early orders from customer projects facilitated by economic stimulus, and automation continues to be an important way to maximize the productivity of available workers. Our recent acquisitions are performing well on both revenue and cost, with Clearpath Robotics being a standout addition to Rockwell's portfolio. We've seen multimillion dollar wins across diverse end-markets, including automotive, food and beverage, and even warehousing and logistics and this is just the beginning. We have a unique portfolio of high-value assets that we've built and bought with the best partner ecosystem in the business. Our focus is now to integrate these elements as only a pure-play can, growing share, profitability and cash flow by driving efficiency and synergy. Aijana, we'll now begin the Q&A session.\nAijana Zellner: Thanks Blake. We would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Juliane, let's take our first question.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning everyone.\nBlake Moret: Hey Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Blake and Nick, you mentioned that your orders were up double-digits sequentially. Could you tell us where backlog was ending Q1? And regardless, you did reiterate your low single-digit order growth for FY 2024. So, are you beginning to see a more substantial turn in orders here in fiscal Q2 as your distributors bottom out their inventory levels? And if so, what end-markets would you say are inflecting the most?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Andy, we ended last year with a backlog of $4.1 billion all in, and it went down high single digits in -- during the first quarter. In terms of what we're seeing with orders, you're exactly right, we're seeing an inflection up in the orders from the Q4 trough. And we're expecting that to continue into the second quarter of double-digit growth into the second quarter. In terms of where that -- where we're seeing that, I'll turn that over to Blake.\nBlake Moret: Yes. Let me just mention additionally, Andy, that distributor inventory is coming down. So, as we've talked about before, we have good visibility into our distributor inventory based on our channel model, and we are seeing that going down as we expected. As we're seeing the orders, it's a good mix across industries, including some of the industries that were pressured by the lower shipments in the first quarter like auto and food and beverage, we're also seeing it across the entire portfolio, as we talked about annual recurring revenue, very strong from a software and a high-value services standpoint and other aspects of Lifecycle Services. But we do expect that that order recovery is going to be broad-based across our key industries, including in discrete and hybrid, to complement the continuing good performance in process such as oil and gas.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Very helpful, guys. And then you didn't change your adjusted EPS guidance for the year, but you did mention that you expect modest EPS growth that's back-end loaded. I know, Blake, you suggested that your supply chain team should catch up with a more book-and-bill type environment in Q2, and Nick, you talked about the margin jump starting in Q3. But maybe you could talk more about confidence level in getting that margin jump you expect in Q3. And does a relatively slow start for EPS for the year suggests modest EPS growth for FY 2024, meaning somewhat lower in that $12 to $13.50 EPS range? Or are you not trying to single that?\nBlake Moret: No. Well, we're reaffirming the guide that we introduced in November. The significant increase in EPS in the second half of the year is based on the increased volume. You'll recall last year, we went from roughly $2 billion of shipments in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 to an exit of around $2.5 billion. And we're expecting to see something similar in this year, in fiscal year 2024, from the Q1 that we were talking about of $2 billion roughly of shipments to around $2.5 billion at the end of the year. That's what's going to drive the higher margins and EPS. Last year, the causal for that ramp was based on getting chip supply. This year, it's the ramp of orders.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Appreciate it guys.\nBlake Moret: Thanks Andy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nBlake Moret: Hi Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Can we just drill back into the supply chain comments? They seem inconsistent, right, when we think about it. Revenues this quarter are lower than revenues in the prior three quarters, right? So, you're getting a lot more out the door the prior three quarters. So, can you just elaborate a little bit more on what exactly happened in supply chain? What kind of bottlenecks you're dealing with? Are they at the Rockwell factory level? Are they at a supplier level? Just please clear that up for us, if you could.\nBlake Moret: Sure Jeff. So, what we're seeing is the shift in the timing going from a dynamic of shipments that's been based entirely on reducing large amounts of backlog, to a recovery to a more normal product book-and-bill process. So, the big shipments that we saw over the last year were based on chips coming in with a very visible really mass of past-due backlog that was in a relatively concentrated set of SKUs for us. So, whether it was variable speed drives or motion control or Logix IO. We had very good visibility into what we needed to ship as soon as we got the chips. We're seeing the shift in Q1, which should be complete in Q2, of moving to a more normal distribution of having the vast majority of our shipments in the quarter based on book-and-bill, that is, new orders coming in that get turned around in the quarter. The things that hampered us in Q1 were the lingering tail of those past-due backlog items that we talked about taking a little bit longer than Q1 to clear out, as well as some continuing component challenges, and then the shift to being able to build safety stock to be able to handle those incoming orders. That progress continues in Q2. We expect to be substantially complete with that in the quarter. But that's the difference of what we were shipping out last year versus what we're shipping out now. I should also mention, we've talked in the past about our capacity being over $10 billion and that remains true. Our capacity to ship in terms of physical plant and labor is over $10 billion and that's going to be important as we continue to grow.\nJeff Sprague: Okay, right. And then again, if we could just talk a little bit more detail, maybe it's for Nick. I think you're pretty explicit on sort of the margins for Q2. Maybe just give us a little bit of color though on kind of the mix and what's driving that. I mean it does sound like you're expecting some sequential revenue lift in Q2. So, why would margins be roughly similar to Q1?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, we're expecting dollar revenue to be very similar in Q2 to what it was in Q1 and a very similar margin. The mix of what we're selling in Q1 to Q2, in Q1, we had more of it coming out of our backlog and less from current quarter book-and-bill. In Q2, that will be shifting -- that mix will be shifting to more coming out of current quarter orders as we continue to bring that backlog down. On the margin front, many of the things that we saw in the first quarter, we're going to be keeping investment spend very similar to what -- in Q2 very similar to what it was in Q1. The year-on-year change of that will come down, but the sequential will be almost identical. And then mix will probably not be as -- was a drain -- was a negative to us in Q1. And we expect mix to continue as a negative into Q2, both from a segment mix where we expect higher growth in -- our highest growth in Lifecycle Services, but also within segments where we're seeing more of our sales in Intelligent Devices coming from our configure-to-order business.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thank you\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nAndrew Obin: Yes, good morning.\nBlake Moret: Morning Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Just to follow-up, I guess, on Jeff's question. If we go back to your Analyst Day, I think the message is that this is a transition year, and then revenue growth mean-reverts to plan next year, which means it's going to accelerate very nicely. Can you just expand, how do you make sure that, over the next 18 months, Rockwell can actually deliver the volumes? Are there any structural changes that you're making to your internal processes and supply chains to sort of ensure a smooth ramp-up?\nBlake Moret: Yes, Andrew, there is. As I mentioned before, the first is to make sure that we have the fixed assets in place. We've been working on that for over a year, which allowed us to get to the $9 billion worth of shipments last year, which was a fairly healthy step-up from prior. And we've kept going to where, today, we feel like we have over $10.5 billion worth of capacity in terms of the assets. As you'll recall, we're a fairly asset-light manufacturing process. It's assembly, it's test fixtures, it's surface mount machines and so on. And we're making sure, not only in our organic business, but also with the acquisitions where we're seeing such strong growth, that we're making the investments to be able to fuel that growth. Labor is the other area. We have adequate product labor in place currently. We are continuing to ramp up based on the growth in our engineered-to-order business and the share gains that we're seeing there, the labor through the year in that. And in some cases, we're holding labor in place to make sure that it's there as we see that order ramp continue through the year. From a structural standpoint, we are working through ways to drive efficiency, to get scale throughout the organization. Some of this is standard lean concepts. But it's also adding the things that we've learned about needing resilience in terms of redundancy across multiple plants, in some cases, redundant sources of supply to be able to reduce the dependence on single suppliers in single parts of the world. So, we're working all of those plays in operations as well as with the engineers. Andrew, going back to your first comment, we do expect to be exiting fiscal year 2024, as we go through this transition, with margins that are very encouraging, as Nick talked about, as well as volume that supports continued growth in 2025 and beyond.\nAndrew Obin: Thank you. And just a follow-up question. We've been getting some incoming calls, just folks concerned about slowdown in packaging CapEx. I think there were specific headlines. Also mining, another area of concern, I know sort of discrete and process. But can you just comment about these two specific markets, maybe a little bit more granularity what you are seeing around the world? Thanks so much.\nBlake Moret: Sure. So, for us, packaging is typically being incorporated as part of our vertical industries of food and beverage, consumer packaged goods. And we are seeing the machinery builders in those areas, in Life Sciences as well, I should mention, there's packaging of medicine in Life Sciences, of course. And we are seeing those machine builders, similar to our distributors work, through inventory in their system. It's in a similar kind of profile to what we're seeing with our distributors, in that we expect over the coming few months, that works off and exposes what we continue to see from direct conversations with those customers, with those machine builders strong underlying demand. With respect to mining, we actually are seeing relative strength in mining in the areas that we focus on. Some of that is driven by materials for batteries. But in general, we do expect to see low single-digit growth in mining in the year.\nAndrew Obin: Thanks so much.\nBlake Moret: Thanks Andrew.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. Sorry about that. Thanks for the question. I'm sorry, I missed a part of the call, Nick, where you were running through the guidance point. Did you call out the degree of order acceleration? I know you called out double-digit growth sequentially. Just wondering if you quantified the order and backlog exiting the quarter.\nNick Gangestad: Yes, I did call some of that out. First, we saw double-digit order growth sequentially in Q1, and we expect double-digit order growth sequentially in Q2. And then further ramp into Q3 and Q4 for orders. And that's being driven by the progress we're seeing with excess inventory in the channel coming out. In terms of the backlog, we ended fiscal year 2023 with a backlog of $4.1 billion, and we saw that come down high single-digit percent in the first quarter.\nNigel Coe: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks and sorry I missed that. Are we still looking at $3 billion as the point where this stabilizes and where we start to see that real inflection in order rates?\nBlake Moret: I'm sorry, the $3 billion?\nNigel Coe: Yes, $3 billion of backlog. I think that's what you called out as sort of normal-ish level.\nNick Gangestad: Yes, what I said on the last call is that we expect the backlog in a more normal range of 30% to 35% of our revenue. I think that we still see that as a good point. I'd say our current projections see us at the high end, closer to the high end of that 30% to 35% range now for fiscal year 2024.\nNigel Coe: Okay, that's great. And then my follow-on question, Nick, is I understand that the mix impacts from Lifecycle services are growing, the Software Control and ID. But maybe the 240 basis points of gross margin compression year-over-year, maybe just unpack that for us in terms of mix versus M&A impacts. Just curious because that -- given that pricing was 3 points, price/cost positive, that's a fairly big delta.\nNick Gangestad: Yes. So, if you look at our press release, we have gross profit down 240 basis points year-on-year. About a third of that is coming from the investment spend that I talked about year-on-year, that that's because our R&D spend is part of that growth. So, that's about a third of that decline in the margin there. Our acquisitions, Clearpath and Verve, are 30 basis points are a small part of that. And then the rest of it would be coming from mix and underutilization of our -- underutilization of our supply chain in the first quarter.\nNigel Coe: Okay, that makes sense. Thanks Nick.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nSteve Tusa: Hi, good morning.\nBlake Moret: Morning.\nNick Gangestad: Hey Steve.\nSteve Tusa: So, I guess just from a stability perspective on the deliveries. Is there a particular end-market or anything like that that's driving this what kind of looks to be a very choppy outcome on delivery? Is it like are there certain segments of the market or product types that are not maybe flowing as smoothly as they have in the past?\nBlake Moret: No, Steve, it's really -- I mean, it is product and it's centered in the Intelligent Devices. So, where you have the greatest diversity of SKUs between variable speed drives, motion control. And these are the areas where you're seeing that shift that I mentioned earlier, where we were bringing down a significant amount of past-due backlog, and now we're moving towards what is a more normal book-and-bill environment. But there's no unsurmountable challenges that we don't expect to be resolved in Q2. It was the shift that we saw really Q1 and a little bit into Q2, is that move from having the vast majority of our shipments as past-due backlog moving to more book-and-bill, centered within the Intelligent Devices segment.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. I guess just also, just, Nick, from an earnings perspective, first half is going to be relatively low, is how much of a linear step-up do you think for 3Q and 4Q as we just think about the seasonality here?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, it will really be bringing us where the first two quarters of this year are, I'd say, under-reflecting end-demand for our products as that excess inventory is being worked through. And then Q3 and Q4 are getting back to a more normal. So, yes, that makes it more heavily weighted to the back half of the year. But given our plans of what we'll be doing from spending, the type of earnings growth, is very consistent with what we expect with that kind of uptick in revenue into Q3 and Q4.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And just lastly, just on the orders, we're getting to something in the kind of 1., I don't know, 1.6, 1.7 range. Is that about right?\nBlake Moret: Yes, we haven't given the specific number, Steve. We talked about double-digit sequential growth from the trough in Q4 to Q1, with expected continuing double-digit sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, and really continuing through the year.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nBlake Moret: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Snyder from UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. I wanted to ask about the guided step-up in margins from the high teens level in the fiscal second quarter to about mid-20s in the fiscal third quarter. I understand volumes are getting better sequentially, but that implied sequential incremental is much, much sharper than what we would kind of say is normalized for the company. So, can you just sort of talk about other drivers of that sequential margin uplift into the back half beyond just volume?\nNick Gangestad: Yes. There's three things I'll point out on that, Chris. The vast majority, I'll say 75% of that margin expansion, is just coming from the volume increase in holding investment spending flat across the year. The second and third pieces are pretty equal. One is coming from the improved utilization of our factories that we'll -- and our supply chain that we'll see as a result of that. And then the third is we saw good progress on our Lifecycle services margin, and we expect that to continue, and that's also going to be part of our continued margin expansion from the first half to the second half.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. I appreciate that. And then on some of the supply chain constraints you guys called out that weighed on shipments in the first quarter. I don't think I caught it, but could you provide any sort of magnitude on how much sales were impacted by that? And it does not seem like that's coming back in the second quarter. It seems like they are then kind of deferred into the back half of the year. Is that right? Thank you.\nNick Gangestad: Yes, I would put the -- we had originally guided that we expected low single-digit growth in the first quarter. We came in at 1. So, there is -- there's a portion, but it's probably in the $50 million to $70 million range of what we're talking about there. And yes, much of that is going into the second half of the year. That is correct.\nChris Snyder: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to try and square sort of the comments on capacity utilization and the supply constraints with inventories. I think they're running -- we'll wait for the Q for the end-December balance, but it sounds like those are sort of stable sequentially maybe. And they've been running at a mid-teens share of sales versus sort of 8%, 9% pre-COVID. And they rose a lot the last 12 months even as sales rose. So, I just want to understand sort of -- it sounds like inventories to sales, inventory days, should fall in the balance of the year. But do you need sort of some -- is that based on a much faster sell-through out of the plant? You need to sort of underproduce somewhat to get the inventory back down? Or do you think that inventories will stay much higher now as a share of sales medium term than pre-COVID for some reason, even though lead-times are normal?\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Julian, there's a few things that will change there. First of all, you know our projection that we're going to move from 140 days of inventory down to 125. That's been there and that's unchanged. Now, the mix of that, as we're looking at this shift to more and more of our revenue coming from current quarter orders that we're booking and billing, part of our action plans there is we see some increased needs for safety stock of those finished goods. So, as we go through the balance of this year, there will be some places where finished goods go up. But that will be more than offset by the reductions that we're seeing in our components driven by the improved lead-times we have for those components as well as our work in progress. So, we're expecting, as we progress through 2024, just to be seeing that kind of shift. The 125 days will still be well above our pre-pandemic levels where we were typically under 100 days of inventory.\nJulian Mitchell: I see. But I guess -- I get it. Sort of two years ago, sort of people would have said you need higher inventory because backlogs are very high and you need inventory to sort of satisfy projects and backlog. But now you're saying as you go back towards a more normal book and ship business, that also requires sort of higher inventories. I just want to sort of understand what's kind of changed in the thinking there.\nNick Gangestad: Yes, in order to have sufficient inventories to be able to ship products very quickly to our customers and our distributors when they want it, we've been working on getting our products recovery back to where we can ship. Now, part of the progress we're making in the next couple of quarters is getting all of our safety stocks on our -- for our finished goods to where we feel they should be in order to make sure we're performing and executing to our customers' expectations. That's part of that plan. And so finished goods will not decline, but we expect all of our decline to be coming in the -- in our raw materials and work in progress.\nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. And just the follow-up on that would be, when you look at your sort of customers and distributors, how are you seeing them managing their inventories of kind of your product? And how are they feeling about those inventory levels today, please?\nBlake Moret: Yes, we expect our distributors to be carrying a little higher amount of inventory given the customer service challenges that the industry has had over the last couple of years, we expect that equilibrium that distributors get to be a little higher level than it was pre-pandemic. And that's with very specific discussions with them about how they're thinking about the balance of customer service and working capital. We're also seeing with our machine builders that, as I mentioned before, some of them are still continuing to work down inventory in their own system, but we expect that to be complete over the coming months. I don't know of any difference in the way machine builders are looking at carrying levels of inventory and working capital. But with our distributors, we do expect them to normalize at a little higher level than they would have traditionally.\nJulian Mitchell: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nBlake Moret: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nNoah Kaye: Thanks very much. I just want to ask one final one on the production constraints. Can you help us understand a little bit better, what is different about the configure-to-order business versus the type of products that you've been working down a backlog? Is there focus on different lines? Does it require different personnel? Just help us understand some of the actual operational dynamics you are going through as you kind of reconfigure for a more normal book-and-ship environment?\nBlake Moret: Sure. Let me just clarify that. The shift that's going on that we saw challenges in the first quarter was the move from servicing backlog of products to shipping out book-and-bill of products where the orders come in in the quarter. We continue to have a certain amount of configure-to-order business, our motor control centers, our big drives, our independent cart technology and so on. That isn't representing the biggest challenge to us. Those are very different processes. Those configure-to-order businesses come in with varying degrees of customization specific to a customer. But the big dynamic that we've been talking about in Q1 is the move from a somewhat concentrated list of SKUs that we have backlog building -- that backlog built up because we couldn't get the chips, moving to book-and-bill of a more diverse set of SKUs as we see the largest portion of our shipments coming from orders received in that quarter, not one or two or three quarters prior. So, that's the main dynamic that we're working through. You have much less visibility to what's coming in from that book-and-bill profile. So that's one of the changes. And what Nick was talking about in the previous question is we're in the process of building up safety stock in those areas so that we can deal with the ebb and flow of the normal order book, in a quarter being able to turn that around and convert those orders to shipments in the quarter. So, those are the processes that are somewhat different from what -- the world we've been living in for the last year or so, to what we're transitioning to and we'll continue to operate in, we hope, for a long time.\nNoah Kaye: Thanks Blake. If I could ask just one follow-up. I think you're not -- you reiterated your organic industry segment outlook essentially for the full year. Is there any change or shift you've seen in the timing of demand and orders for any of the major segments or subsegments? It does seem like most of the cadence here is really driven by your own production considerations and where channel inventory is. But is there any shift in timing you can see among the end-customers?\nBlake Moret: Yes, I think you said it right. The largest impact is based on getting those shipments out the door, being able to see the distributors return to equilibrium. We continue to see good activity in process applications. We talked about oil and gas, specialty chemical, mining. These are all areas that are relatively strong. Certainly, we've seen some slowdown in certain of the EV projects, but those projects are continuing. We're continuing to win new business in those areas. And as I talked about in my prepared remarks, in traditional internal combustion engines and in hybrid manufacturing, we have very good readiness to serve in those areas as well, with a lot of experience. So, in a year of low growth, we're not seeing any big ebbs and flows in the vertical end-market needs being the predominant factor in any changes through the year.\nNoah Kaye: Understood. Thanks Blake.\nBlake Moret: Thanks.\nAijana Zellner: Juliane, we'll take one more question.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJoe O'Dea: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First, I just wanted to ask about the back half of the year margin profile. And it does seem like a transition from maybe a higher concentration of a narrower band of products that you would have had shipping out of backlog in 2023 compared to more kind of book-and-shipping quarter in 2024 is a bit of a mix headwind. And so when we think about back half of 2024 margins being better than back half of 2023, can you expand on that a little bit? Is it Devices is up, Lifecycle is up, maybe Software and Control is down a bit year-over-year? Just trying to contemplate what could still be a year-over-year mix headwind as you broaden out the book and ship?\nBlake Moret: Yes, I think what you're seeing from a positive standpoint is the greater percentage of products as those orders increase through the year. To be sure, we are seeing some headwind based on the comparables with the year where Logix grew over 30% last year as one of our most profitable product lines. But the other point is that, recognizing the puts and takes in this year, we did take cost out beginning in Q4 of the last year. And so that gives us help to being able to push those margins at the exit of 2024 higher than they were. That's in -- across our business and functions, most noticeably in Lifecycle Services.\nJoe O'Dea: Great. And then just on the sort of channel inventory observations, and it sounds like taking a little bit longer than previously anticipated to get channel inventories to targeted levels, what are your observations of why that is in terms of kind of end market demand patterns or maybe a little bit more inventory out there than you appreciated for why it would be more middle of the year versus first half of the year where we would have seen channel inventory correct?\nBlake Moret: We're really talking about variability that could be in the area of weeks or a month. I wouldn't read too much into talking middle of the year versus second quarter. We did see a good double-digit sequential increase in orders in Q1. We expect that again in Q2. January represents a sequential increase based on what we've seen so far from Q1. And so we continue to see that inventory at our distributors coming down pretty much as we expected.\nNick Gangestad: Yes, Joe, I'll just add. I mean, we're obviously in close dialogue with all of our distributors, and a high percentage of them are affirming to us that they expect to be done with -- they're reducing excess inventory sometime during Q2 and that they're at an equilibrium point there.\nJoe O'Dea: That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you.\nAijana Zellner: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. That concludes today's conference call.\nOperator: At this time, you may disconnect. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nick Gangestad",
            "content": "Thank you, Blake and good morning everyone. I'll start on Slide 7, first quarter key financial information. First quarter reported sales were up 3.6% over last year. Q1 organic sales were up 1%, and acquisitions contributed 140 basis points to total growth. Currency translation increased sales by 120 basis points. About 3 points of our organic growth came from price, in line with our expectations. Segment operating margin was 17.3%, compared to 20.2% a year ago. This 290 basis point decrease reflects higher investment spend, mix between products and solutions, and lower supply chain utilization. While our Q1 spend was down sequentially, we had a difficult year-over-year comparison due to an abnormally low investment spend in Q1 of last year. Key areas of year-over-year spending increases include investments in new products, digital infrastructure, and commercial resources. I'll comment later on the expected progression of our investment spend when I cover our full year outlook. As Blake mentioned, orders inflected upward sequentially, and we expect strong sequential order growth through the remainder of the year. The expected slope of orders is consistent with what we have discussed over the last couple of quarters. Adjusted EPS of $2.04, down 17% compared to last year, was below our expectations, primarily due to lower-than-expected sales and lower segment operating margin. The devaluation of the Argentine peso was an additional $0.10 adjusted EPS headwind in Q1. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 18%, slightly above the prior year rate. Free cash flow was negative $35 million, compared to a positive $42 million in the prior year. Our lower year-over-year free cash flow generation in the quarter was driven by higher incentive compensation payout during the quarter, which was tied to our fiscal 2023 performance. Working capital decreased in Q1, driven by lower accounts receivable, partially offset by lower accounts payable. One additional item not shown on the slide. We repurchased approximately 400,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $120 million. On December 31st, $800 million remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 8 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Blake discussed our top line performance in the quarter, so I'll focus on our margin performance. As I mentioned earlier, our investment spend in the year-ago quarter was lower than normal as most of the incremental fiscal 2023 investments started in Q2 of last year. This resulted in a difficult year-over-year margin comparison in Q1 for both Intelligent Devices and Software & Control. Intelligent Devices margin decreased to 16.2%, compared to 22.4% a year ago. The decrease from prior year was driven by lower sales volume, the timing of prior year investment spend, and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by positive price/cost. Our Clearpath and CUBIC acquisitions, both part of Intelligent Devices, are performing well and are making commercial -- and we are making commercial and technical investments here to accelerate profitable growth. Software & Control margin of 25% decreased from 29.2% last year. The lower margin was driven by the timing of prior year investment spend and lower supply chain utilization, partially offset by price/cost. Lifecycle Services book-to-bill was 1.13. Lifecycle Services margin of 10.4% doubled from the year-ago margin of 5.2%. Strong margin performance was driven by higher sales, lower incentive compensation, and higher margins in Sensia. We are realizing productivity benefits from Lifecycle Services restructuring actions we took last year and those benefits are coming in as expected. The next slide, 9, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q1 fiscal 2023 to Q1 fiscal 2024. Core performance was down $0.10 on a 1% organic sales increase as positive price/cost was more than offset by negative product mix and lower supply chain utilization. Higher investment spend was a $0.40 EPS headwind. Incentive compensation was a $0.20 tailwind. This year-over-year improvement reflects a lower projected bonus payout this year versus an above-target payout last year. The impact from acquisitions was a $0.10 headwind and aligned with our expectations. The year-over-year impact from currency was a $0.05 headwind, with the $0.10 headwind from the Argentine peso revaluation more than offsetting the positive impact from other currencies. The $0.05 -- the net $0.05 currency headwind was offset by a $0.05 tailwind from interest expense. Share count and tax rate were each immaterial to the year-over-year change in EPS this quarter. Let's now move on to the next slide, 10, guidance for fiscal 2024. We are reaffirming our guidance for fiscal 2024 of reported sales growth of 0.5% to 6.5%, and organic sales growth in the range of negative 2% to positive 4%. As Blake mentioned earlier, we now expect acquisitions to add 150 basis points to growth, up from 100 basis points in our prior guidance, as the growing pipeline of projects from Clearpath is leading to higher expected growth. Given this improvement, Clearpath is now expected to dilute adjusted EPS by $0.20 versus our prior expectation of $0.25. We now expect a full year currency tailwind of 100 basis points, down from 150 basis points in our prior guide because projections for the euro and the Canadian dollar have weakened slightly for the year. We continue to expect price to be a positive contributor to growth for the year. We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. And we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance range of $12 to $13.50. We expect full year fiscal 2024 free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. This reflects our continued expectation that inventory days on hand will drop to approximately 125 days by the end of fiscal year 2024, compared to 140 days of inventory we had at the end of fiscal year 2023. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the first half to be well below 100%, mostly tied to the higher incentive compensation payment made in Q1 relative to our fiscal year 2023 performance, and higher income tax payments related to the realized capital gain on the sale of our stake in PTC, as well as our Tax Cuts and Jobs Act transition tax payment. From a calendarization perspective, we expect Q2 sales dollars and segment margin to be similar to Q1 levels. We previously expected the lead-times on our last constrained products would return to normal by the end of Q1. This is now being pushed back to the middle of the year. This means that our split between first half and second half revenue will be even more weighted towards the second half. Our plan was and continues to be for balanced spend across the four quarters of fiscal year 2024, compared to our upward trajectory of spend in fiscal year 2023, as confidence in supply chain recovery pace grew. Given the split of sales between first and second half, that means first half margins will be noticeably lower compared to the year prior and second half margins noticeably higher. We expect margins in Q2 to remain similar to what they were in Q1 and then increase to the mid-20s in Q3 and Q4. That expansion in margin is virtually all -- driven virtually all by revenue returning to levels consistent with end demand. We anticipate investment spend to be relatively flat across the four quarters of fiscal year 2024. From a year-on-year perspective, Q2 and Q3 increases in investment spend will be approximately $10 million each and then a year-over-year decrease in Q4. A few additional comments on fiscal 2024 guidance. Corporate and other expense is expected to be around $125 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2024 is expected to be about $120 million and we're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.1 million shares. We expect to deploy between $300 million and $500 million to share repurchases during the year. With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake? Yes, Andy, we ended last year with a backlog of $4.1 billion all in, and it went down high single digits in -- during the first quarter. In terms of what we're seeing with orders, you're exactly right, we're seeing an inflection up in the orders from the Q4 trough. And we're expecting that to continue into the second quarter of double-digit growth into the second quarter. In terms of where that -- where we're seeing that, I'll turn that over to Blake. Yes, we're expecting dollar revenue to be very similar in Q2 to what it was in Q1 and a very similar margin. The mix of what we're selling in Q1 to Q2, in Q1, we had more of it coming out of our backlog and less from current quarter book-and-bill. In Q2, that will be shifting -- that mix will be shifting to more coming out of current quarter orders as we continue to bring that backlog down. On the margin front, many of the things that we saw in the first quarter, we're going to be keeping investment spend very similar to what -- in Q2 very similar to what it was in Q1. The year-on-year change of that will come down, but the sequential will be almost identical. And then mix will probably not be as -- was a drain -- was a negative to us in Q1. And we expect mix to continue as a negative into Q2, both from a segment mix where we expect higher growth in -- our highest growth in Lifecycle Services, but also within segments where we're seeing more of our sales in Intelligent Devices coming from our configure-to-order business. Yes, I did call some of that out. First, we saw double-digit order growth sequentially in Q1, and we expect double-digit order growth sequentially in Q2. And then further ramp into Q3 and Q4 for orders. And that's being driven by the progress we're seeing with excess inventory in the channel coming out. In terms of the backlog, we ended fiscal year 2023 with a backlog of $4.1 billion, and we saw that come down high single-digit percent in the first quarter. Yes, what I said on the last call is that we expect the backlog in a more normal range of 30% to 35% of our revenue. I think that we still see that as a good point. I'd say our current projections see us at the high end, closer to the high end of that 30% to 35% range now for fiscal year 2024. Yes. So, if you look at our press release, we have gross profit down 240 basis points year-on-year. About a third of that is coming from the investment spend that I talked about year-on-year, that that's because our R&D spend is part of that growth. So, that's about a third of that decline in the margin there. Our acquisitions, Clearpath and Verve, are 30 basis points are a small part of that. And then the rest of it would be coming from mix and underutilization of our -- underutilization of our supply chain in the first quarter. Hey Steve. Yes, it will really be bringing us where the first two quarters of this year are, I'd say, under-reflecting end-demand for our products as that excess inventory is being worked through. And then Q3 and Q4 are getting back to a more normal. So, yes, that makes it more heavily weighted to the back half of the year. But given our plans of what we'll be doing from spending, the type of earnings growth, is very consistent with what we expect with that kind of uptick in revenue into Q3 and Q4. Yes. There's three things I'll point out on that, Chris. The vast majority, I'll say 75% of that margin expansion, is just coming from the volume increase in holding investment spending flat across the year. The second and third pieces are pretty equal. One is coming from the improved utilization of our factories that we'll -- and our supply chain that we'll see as a result of that. And then the third is we saw good progress on our Lifecycle services margin, and we expect that to continue, and that's also going to be part of our continued margin expansion from the first half to the second half. Yes, I would put the -- we had originally guided that we expected low single-digit growth in the first quarter. We came in at 1. So, there is -- there's a portion, but it's probably in the $50 million to $70 million range of what we're talking about there. And yes, much of that is going into the second half of the year. That is correct. Yes, Julian, there's a few things that will change there. First of all, you know our projection that we're going to move from 140 days of inventory down to 125. That's been there and that's unchanged. Now, the mix of that, as we're looking at this shift to more and more of our revenue coming from current quarter orders that we're booking and billing, part of our action plans there is we see some increased needs for safety stock of those finished goods. So, as we go through the balance of this year, there will be some places where finished goods go up. But that will be more than offset by the reductions that we're seeing in our components driven by the improved lead-times we have for those components as well as our work in progress. So, we're expecting, as we progress through 2024, just to be seeing that kind of shift. The 125 days will still be well above our pre-pandemic levels where we were typically under 100 days of inventory. Yes, in order to have sufficient inventories to be able to ship products very quickly to our customers and our distributors when they want it, we've been working on getting our products recovery back to where we can ship. Now, part of the progress we're making in the next couple of quarters is getting all of our safety stocks on our -- for our finished goods to where we feel they should be in order to make sure we're performing and executing to our customers' expectations. That's part of that plan. And so finished goods will not decline, but we expect all of our decline to be coming in the -- in our raw materials and work in progress. Yes, Joe, I'll just add. I mean, we're obviously in close dialogue with all of our distributors, and a high percentage of them are affirming to us that they expect to be done with -- they're reducing excess inventory sometime during Q2 and that they're at an equilibrium point there."

            "name": "Blake Moret",
            "content": "Thanks Aijana and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our first quarter results on Slide 3. This quarter, we saw double-digit sequential growth in orders, with all business segments and regions up from the trough in Q4 of last year. While we are continuing to see the impact of excess inventory in the channel, the underlying demand from machine builders and end-users remain strong. Total sales were up 3.6% year-over-year. Organic sales grew 1% in the quarter, led by North America. China was the single largest drag on our shipments. Currency translation increased sales by over 1 point, and acquisitions contributed almost 1.5 points of growth. Our organic sales did come in below our expectations, largely due to the timing of our recovery to a more normal product book-and-bill process. As a source of our demand shifts from older backlog to new orders that need to be shipped as soon as they are received, we are working through some lingering shortages and line constraints. Our supply chain team is expected to complete this transition in Q2 with little impact on the full year. In our Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales were down 4.5% versus prior year. While product shipments in this segment experienced the biggest supply chain constraints in the quarter, we were able to offset some of that impact with strong performance from our configure-to-order businesses and from recent acquisitions. Our Clearpath and CUBIC acquisitions had a strong quarter, both on topline and bottom-line, showcasing the tremendous value these offerings are bringing to our customers across new verticals and applications. Last quarter, I talked about our presence in datacenter build-outs and CUBIC's momentum with large cloud service providers continues to fuel our growth in this end-market. I'll touch on some of the important Clearpath wins later on the call. Software & Control organic sales increased 4% year-over-year and were in line with our expectations. Logix continues to demonstrate unique value in the marketplace, and we've made some major software investments in this segment over the last few years. We are seeing the value from this innovation, demonstrated by double-digit sales growth in our cloud-native and on-prem information software offerings. Lifecycle Services organic sales grew over 8% versus prior year, better than we expected. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.13, with strong order activity across solutions, services, and our Sensia joint venture. I'm pleased with how our Sensia team is making progress, with profitable growth in the quarter. Q1 orders and sales were up over 25% year-over-year. One of the strategic Sensia wins this quarter was with Mellitah Oil & Gas joint venture, one of the largest oil and gas companies in Libya. Sensia's advanced measurement technology is helping this customer modernize all of their liquid metering skids and establishes Sensia as one of the key players in the region for major metering turnkey solutions. Another highlight of the quarter was our continued growth in ARR. Total annual recurring revenue was up 20% year-over-year, with strong growth across our Plex and Fiix SaaS offerings and recurring services, including our growing cybersecurity business. The impact of these contracts on our financial performance is also increasing, especially in a year with relatively low product growth. This quarter, our Plex SaaS platform was selected by EOS Energy, an energy start-up focused on grid scale storage for utility companies. EOS Energy, in partnership with Acro Automation Systems, has selected Rockwell Automation to provide Plex MES and QMS information software to compliment Acro's battery manufacturing solution built on Rockwell's control platform. Acro is currently building out the first state-of-the-art manufacturing line that will manufacture EOS Energy's next gen Z3 batteries. Segment margin of about 17% and adjusted EPS of $2.04 were both down versus prior year. The adjusted EPS was below our expectations, and Nick will discuss this further in a few minutes. Let's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q1 industry segment performance. Before we get into the individual verticals, keep in mind that the more product-intensive industries were the most impacted by planned shipments moving to Q2 and later in the year. Our discrete sales were down 10% year-over-year. Within discrete, automotive sales were down high single-digits. While auto customers are focused on near-term profitability and temporary slowdown in EV demand, they continue to fund new EV and battery CapEx programs. In addition to these investments, we are seeing increased activity across our traditional ICE and plugin hybrid platforms as brand owners and tier suppliers are looking to diversify their exposure in response to consumer demand and infrastructure limitations. As you know, Rockwell has a substantial installed base with these established automotive customers, and is well positioned to capture additional market share, regardless of the application. This quarter, our Logix platform was selected by Akasol/Borg Warner, a global battery producer and automotive tier supplier developing innovative battery manufacturing processes for their production plants in Seneca, South Carolina and Darmstadt, Germany. This customer plans to increase their production volume in Europe and North America and scale to more plants globally. Another exciting automotive win this quarter came from Clearpath Robotics, where a large brand owner will be using over a hundred of our Otto autonomous mobile robots in their US sub-assembly applications. Semiconductor sales were also down high-single-digits versus prior year. While the industry is still navigating through a myriad of challenges, including geopolitical risk, excess memory capacity, and workforce shortages, we continue to see new announcements and orders for greenfield projects and legacy fab upgrades, along with continued momentum in our wafer transport solutions. Within our eCommerce and Warehouse Automation industry, sales declined mid-teens and were in line with our expectations. Customers across many verticals continue to modernize their existing operations to match the current market's needs. In addition to a strong funnel of these warehouse transformation projects, we are starting to see renewed CapEx plans from our eCommerce customers for fulfilment center builds later in fiscal year 2024 and in fiscal year 2025. Moving to our hybrid industries. Within this industry segment, growth in life sciences and tire were offset by declines in food and beverage. Food and beverage sales were down high-single-digits versus prior year. Given the mix of products serving this customer segment, our Q1 performance in this vertical was most impacted by our internal capacity constraints mentioned earlier on the call. Similar to previous quarters, we continue to see large end users investing their digital and cyber capabilities across their global footprint. This quarter, we had another sizeable Clearpath win at one of the largest food and beverage manufacturers in the world, where the customer chose our Otto AMRs to replace their existing AGV system to increase throughput and flexibility, while enhancing material movement security. It is clear our customers across many industries are focused on augmenting their existing workforce through autonomous and innovative solutions to drive further productivity, safety, and sustainability in their operations. Life sciences sales grew 10% in the quarter. Note that our life sciences revenue is more weighted to software and services versus products. In addition to our MES and cybersecurity services momentum, we are continuing to see increased investments in high-growth areas, such as Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products and GLP-1 diabetes and obesity drugs. Tire was up high-single-digits. Moving to process. Sales in this industry segment grew over 10% year-over-year, once again led by strong growth in oil and gas, metals, and mining. Oil and gas sales were up over 25% this quarter. I already mentioned our performance in Sensia, and we continue to see follow-on orders from our customers' decarbonization and digitization projects worldwide. Let's turn to Slide 5 and our Q1 organic regional sales. North America organic sales were up over 4% year-over-year. North American manufacturers are continuing to invest, and we expect this region to be our strongest-performing market this year. Latin America was down half a point. EMEA sales were down about 2%, and Asia Pacific sales declined over 7%. Similar to the last few quarters, we continue to see challenges in the Chinese manufacturing economy, with high cancellations and pushouts relative to the rest of the world. Sales in China were down high teens versus prior year. Moving to Slide 6 for our fiscal 2024 outlook. We continue to expect our full-year orders to grow low-single-digits versus prior year, with strong sequential growth through the balance of this fiscal year. Factoring in our performance through January, our continuous analysis of distributor inventory levels, and strong pipeline of customer projects, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2024 sales guidance range with organic sales projected to grow 1% at the midpoint. Currency is also expected to increase sales by 1%, and we now expect acquisitions to contribute a 1.5 of growth. ARR is still slated to grow about 15%. Segment margin is expected to increase slightly versus prior year, with significant second half increases coming from increased product volume, spending discipline, and the growing benefit of productivity initiatives being taken in Lifecycle Services. Nick will share additional calendarization detail in his section. Adjusted EPS is slated to grow 5% year-over-year at the midpoint, again weighted to the back half of the year, and we still expect Free Cash Flow conversion of 100%. Let me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q1 performance and financial outlook for fiscal 2024. Nick? Thanks Nick. Despite geopolitical volatility, our detailed discussions with our distributors, machine builders, and end-users point to fairly healthy market conditions. Our outlook for fiscal year 2024 is based on an acceleration of new product orders as distributors and machine builders reduce excessive inventory. Our operations team is working around the clock to ensure we can convert these new orders into shipments at lead-times that are as good or better than pre-pandemic lead-times. We continue to gain share across our key platforms, especially here in North America. We are seeing early orders from customer projects facilitated by economic stimulus, and automation continues to be an important way to maximize the productivity of available workers. Our recent acquisitions are performing well on both revenue and cost, with Clearpath Robotics being a standout addition to Rockwell's portfolio. We've seen multimillion dollar wins across diverse end-markets, including automotive, food and beverage, and even warehousing and logistics and this is just the beginning. We have a unique portfolio of high-value assets that we've built and bought with the best partner ecosystem in the business. Our focus is now to integrate these elements as only a pure-play can, growing share, profitability and cash flow by driving efficiency and synergy. Aijana, we'll now begin the Q&A session. Hey Andy. Yes. Let me just mention additionally, Andy, that distributor inventory is coming down. So, as we've talked about before, we have good visibility into our distributor inventory based on our channel model, and we are seeing that going down as we expected. As we're seeing the orders, it's a good mix across industries, including some of the industries that were pressured by the lower shipments in the first quarter like auto and food and beverage, we're also seeing it across the entire portfolio, as we talked about annual recurring revenue, very strong from a software and a high-value services standpoint and other aspects of Lifecycle Services. But we do expect that that order recovery is going to be broad-based across our key industries, including in discrete and hybrid, to complement the continuing good performance in process such as oil and gas. No. Well, we're reaffirming the guide that we introduced in November. The significant increase in EPS in the second half of the year is based on the increased volume. You'll recall last year, we went from roughly $2 billion of shipments in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 to an exit of around $2.5 billion. And we're expecting to see something similar in this year, in fiscal year 2024, from the Q1 that we were talking about of $2 billion roughly of shipments to around $2.5 billion at the end of the year. That's what's going to drive the higher margins and EPS. Last year, the causal for that ramp was based on getting chip supply. This year, it's the ramp of orders. Thanks Andy. Hi Jeff. Sure Jeff. So, what we're seeing is the shift in the timing going from a dynamic of shipments that's been based entirely on reducing large amounts of backlog, to a recovery to a more normal product book-and-bill process. So, the big shipments that we saw over the last year were based on chips coming in with a very visible really mass of past-due backlog that was in a relatively concentrated set of SKUs for us. So, whether it was variable speed drives or motion control or Logix IO. We had very good visibility into what we needed to ship as soon as we got the chips. We're seeing the shift in Q1, which should be complete in Q2, of moving to a more normal distribution of having the vast majority of our shipments in the quarter based on book-and-bill, that is, new orders coming in that get turned around in the quarter. The things that hampered us in Q1 were the lingering tail of those past-due backlog items that we talked about taking a little bit longer than Q1 to clear out, as well as some continuing component challenges, and then the shift to being able to build safety stock to be able to handle those incoming orders. That progress continues in Q2. We expect to be substantially complete with that in the quarter. But that's the difference of what we were shipping out last year versus what we're shipping out now. I should also mention, we've talked in the past about our capacity being over $10 billion and that remains true. Our capacity to ship in terms of physical plant and labor is over $10 billion and that's going to be important as we continue to grow. Morning Andrew. Yes, Andrew, there is. As I mentioned before, the first is to make sure that we have the fixed assets in place. We've been working on that for over a year, which allowed us to get to the $9 billion worth of shipments last year, which was a fairly healthy step-up from prior. And we've kept going to where, today, we feel like we have over $10.5 billion worth of capacity in terms of the assets. As you'll recall, we're a fairly asset-light manufacturing process. It's assembly, it's test fixtures, it's surface mount machines and so on. And we're making sure, not only in our organic business, but also with the acquisitions where we're seeing such strong growth, that we're making the investments to be able to fuel that growth. Labor is the other area. We have adequate product labor in place currently. We are continuing to ramp up based on the growth in our engineered-to-order business and the share gains that we're seeing there, the labor through the year in that. And in some cases, we're holding labor in place to make sure that it's there as we see that order ramp continue through the year. From a structural standpoint, we are working through ways to drive efficiency, to get scale throughout the organization. Some of this is standard lean concepts. But it's also adding the things that we've learned about needing resilience in terms of redundancy across multiple plants, in some cases, redundant sources of supply to be able to reduce the dependence on single suppliers in single parts of the world. So, we're working all of those plays in operations as well as with the engineers. Andrew, going back to your first comment, we do expect to be exiting fiscal year 2024, as we go through this transition, with margins that are very encouraging, as Nick talked about, as well as volume that supports continued growth in 2025 and beyond. Sure. So, for us, packaging is typically being incorporated as part of our vertical industries of food and beverage, consumer packaged goods. And we are seeing the machinery builders in those areas, in Life Sciences as well, I should mention, there's packaging of medicine in Life Sciences, of course. And we are seeing those machine builders, similar to our distributors work, through inventory in their system. It's in a similar kind of profile to what we're seeing with our distributors, in that we expect over the coming few months, that works off and exposes what we continue to see from direct conversations with those customers, with those machine builders strong underlying demand. With respect to mining, we actually are seeing relative strength in mining in the areas that we focus on. Some of that is driven by materials for batteries. But in general, we do expect to see low single-digit growth in mining in the year. Thanks Andrew. I'm sorry, the $3 billion? Morning. No, Steve, it's really -- I mean, it is product and it's centered in the Intelligent Devices. So, where you have the greatest diversity of SKUs between variable speed drives, motion control. And these are the areas where you're seeing that shift that I mentioned earlier, where we were bringing down a significant amount of past-due backlog, and now we're moving towards what is a more normal book-and-bill environment. But there's no unsurmountable challenges that we don't expect to be resolved in Q2. It was the shift that we saw really Q1 and a little bit into Q2, is that move from having the vast majority of our shipments as past-due backlog moving to more book-and-bill, centered within the Intelligent Devices segment. Yes, we haven't given the specific number, Steve. We talked about double-digit sequential growth from the trough in Q4 to Q1, with expected continuing double-digit sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, and really continuing through the year. Yes, thank you. Yes, we expect our distributors to be carrying a little higher amount of inventory given the customer service challenges that the industry has had over the last couple of years, we expect that equilibrium that distributors get to be a little higher level than it was pre-pandemic. And that's with very specific discussions with them about how they're thinking about the balance of customer service and working capital. We're also seeing with our machine builders that, as I mentioned before, some of them are still continuing to work down inventory in their own system, but we expect that to be complete over the coming months. I don't know of any difference in the way machine builders are looking at carrying levels of inventory and working capital. But with our distributors, we do expect them to normalize at a little higher level than they would have traditionally. Thank you. Sure. Let me just clarify that. The shift that's going on that we saw challenges in the first quarter was the move from servicing backlog of products to shipping out book-and-bill of products where the orders come in in the quarter. We continue to have a certain amount of configure-to-order business, our motor control centers, our big drives, our independent cart technology and so on. That isn't representing the biggest challenge to us. Those are very different processes. Those configure-to-order businesses come in with varying degrees of customization specific to a customer. But the big dynamic that we've been talking about in Q1 is the move from a somewhat concentrated list of SKUs that we have backlog building -- that backlog built up because we couldn't get the chips, moving to book-and-bill of a more diverse set of SKUs as we see the largest portion of our shipments coming from orders received in that quarter, not one or two or three quarters prior. So, that's the main dynamic that we're working through. You have much less visibility to what's coming in from that book-and-bill profile. So that's one of the changes. And what Nick was talking about in the previous question is we're in the process of building up safety stock in those areas so that we can deal with the ebb and flow of the normal order book, in a quarter being able to turn that around and convert those orders to shipments in the quarter. So, those are the processes that are somewhat different from what -- the world we've been living in for the last year or so, to what we're transitioning to and we'll continue to operate in, we hope, for a long time. Yes, I think you said it right. The largest impact is based on getting those shipments out the door, being able to see the distributors return to equilibrium. We continue to see good activity in process applications. We talked about oil and gas, specialty chemical, mining. These are all areas that are relatively strong. Certainly, we've seen some slowdown in certain of the EV projects, but those projects are continuing. We're continuing to win new business in those areas. And as I talked about in my prepared remarks, in traditional internal combustion engines and in hybrid manufacturing, we have very good readiness to serve in those areas as well, with a lot of experience. So, in a year of low growth, we're not seeing any big ebbs and flows in the vertical end-market needs being the predominant factor in any changes through the year. Thanks. Yes, I think what you're seeing from a positive standpoint is the greater percentage of products as those orders increase through the year. To be sure, we are seeing some headwind based on the comparables with the year where Logix grew over 30% last year as one of our most profitable product lines. But the other point is that, recognizing the puts and takes in this year, we did take cost out beginning in Q4 of the last year. And so that gives us help to being able to push those margins at the exit of 2024 higher than they were. That's in -- across our business and functions, most noticeably in Lifecycle Services. We're really talking about variability that could be in the area of weeks or a month. I wouldn't read too much into talking middle of the year versus second quarter. We did see a good double-digit sequential increase in orders in Q1. We expect that again in Q2. January represents a sequential increase based on what we've seen so far from Q1. And so we continue to see that inventory at our distributors coming down pretty much as we expected."
