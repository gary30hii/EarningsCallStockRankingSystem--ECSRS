After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session with publishing analysts. At this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for Kellogg Company. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Mr. Renwick, you may begin your conference call.\nJohn Renwick: Good morning and thank you for joining us today for a review of our four quarter and full year 2020 results as well as a discussion regarding our outlook for 2021. I'm joined this morning by Steve Cahillane, our Chairman and CEO; and Amit Banati, our Chief Financial Officer. Slide 3 shows our forward-looking statements disclaimer. And as you are aware, certain statements made today such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to this third slide of the presentation as well as to our public SEC filings. This is of particular note during the current COVID-19 pandemic when the length and severity of the crisis and resultant economic and business impacts are so difficult to predict. A recording of today's webcast and supporting documents will be archived for at least 90 days on the Investor page of kelloggcompany.com. As always, when referring to our results and outlook, unless otherwise noted, we will be referring to them on an organic basis for net sales and on a currency-neutral adjusted basis for operating profit and earnings per share. And now, I'll turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Cahillane: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are holding up well in these turbulent times. Certainly, 2020 was an extraordinary year and I'm incredibly proud of how our organization responded to and executed during a business environment that was anything but business as usual. Keeping our employees safe remains job one and this has required investment and changes to the way we work. Supplying the marketplace with food required agility, contingency planning and creative ways to increase production. Not to mention the courage and dedication of our frontline workers. In aiding our communities a key element of our company's culture and legacy was accelerated during the crisis and it has been especially heartwarming to see our employees giving their time and effort to the cause. We also preserved and improved our financial flexibility. These have been our priorities during the crisis and we've been executing well against all of them. And even while having execute against crisis management priorities, we also over delivered on our financial commitments. We did our best to provide you with guidance during the year despite an uncertain environment. And I trust that transparency was helpful to you. We ended up raising that guidance twice during the year, ultimately hitting or exceeding that guidance with our quarter four and full year results even after absorbing $20 million in one-time costs related to redeeming debt late in the year. This is the kind of dependability we are striving for. We set out this year to return to balance financial growth, meaning balance between top-line growth, margin expansion and cash flow conversion. And sure enough through all the unusual impacts divestiture impact, COVID impacts, 53rd week, we did return to balance financial growth in 2020. Strong organic net sales growth even if you exclude a reasonable estimate for COVID net benefit and expansion in gross profit margin despite incremental COVID-related costs; growth and operating profit even despite losing about six percentage points from the mechanical impact of last year's divestiture; a better than expected increase in cash flow featuring a significantly improved conversion of net income; even excluding COVID net benefits we returned to balance financial growth in 2020 right on schedule. We executed very well in market. The pandemic presented us with a sampling event like none other and we saw increases in household penetration that outpaced most of our categories, giving us an excellent opportunity to communicate to and retain new and lapsed consumers. And we outgrew most of our categories holding or gaining share of categories representing more than 80% of our net sales in those measured markets. Our emerging markets are a key long-term growth driver for us and they represent over 20% of our net sales. In 2020 they were severely tested by pandemic related shutdowns, economic slowdowns, even social unrest and yet they delivered high single digit organic net sales growth for us in 2020, even accelerating from the prior two years growth rates. This is a real testament to our portfolio, our local supply chains and our experienced management teams in these markets. In short, the business performed very well in 2020 and we will take that momentum into 2021. Throughout the crisis, we have been working to ensure that there are lasting impacts from 2020 that should increase confidence in our ability to deliver consistent, dependable balanced growth over time. I'll discuss just a few of them here. One is communicating with new and lapsed households. Rather than giving up on A&P, we couldn't execute in the first half. We shifted that budget and investment to the second half, focusing on advertising to these new and lapsed users. And we've leveraged advanced data and analytics to target those households and occasions. This gives us our best opportunity to retain an expanded consumer base. We know that online shopping for food experienced a step change in 2020. Our triple digit growth in ecommerce sales was made possible by the brands in our portfolio and by our recent years investment in infrastructure and capabilities. This will continue to benefit us. We're investing in our supply chain. This includes sustaining enhanced safety protocols that carry with them higher costs. But the crisis also resulted in us increasing our supply chains agility and reducing complexity with the exiting of certain non-core product lines and tail SKUs. And it accelerated our expansion of capacity in areas that were already tight before this pandemic hit. This two will benefit us in 2021 and beyond. Enhanced financial flexibility is another lasting benefit. Improved cash flow generation and the prioritization of debt reduction resulted in deleveraging our balance sheet faster than we had anticipated. As Amit will discuss in a moment, this financial flexibility puts us in a position to resume dividend increases and share repurchases earlier than previously planned, returning more cash to share owners. And lastly, we remained solidly on track for consistent balanced growth. Even amidst the crisis, our focus was on what is best for sustainable growth. In addition to sustaining our solid top-line growth, we have organizational focus on improving gross profit margin, increasing the return on our brand building investment and discipline on overhead. There will be noise and uncertainty around the pandemic and its impacts. But in the spirit of transparency, we will continue to provide you guidance on our planning stance today. Our guidance for 2021 indicates balanced growth on a two year basis, attempting to smooth out 2020s unusual events and to ensure that we remain on our balanced trajectory. So with that, let me turn it over to Amit, who will take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail.\nAmit Banati: Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. In a year of unprecedented uncertainty, we consistently kept you apprised of our planning stance, raising our guidance twice during the year. And as shown on Slide number nine, we ultimately achieved or exceeded that guidance with the results we announced today. This improving outlook across the year reflected the impact of elevated at home consumption, of course, but it also reflected the strength of our underlying business and our return to balance growth. Let's first review our 2020 results, which are summarized on Slide number 10. As I mentioned, our results for the first quarter came in better than expected, organic net sales growth moderated to 2.5% in quarter four, slightly better than we had forecast and finished the year with 6% growth as guided. Currency neutral adjusted basis operating profit increased slightly year-on-year in the fourth quarter, which was better than we had forecast for a quarter with double-digit, brand building investment, incremental COVID costs and higher performance based compensation. We finished the year with currency neutral adjusted basis, operating profit growth of 3.5%, which is higher than our guidance and includes roughly 6% negative impact from the absence of businesses we divested in 2019. Currency neutral adjusted basis earnings per share declined year-on-year in quarter four owing to a higher tax rate and shares outstanding as well as absorbing $20 million of non-recurring costs related to our debt redemption we executed in December as part of our effort to deleverage our balance sheet. For the year, our earnings per share grew 2.5% which excludes roughly 5% negative impact from the absence of divested businesses. Finally, our cash flow of nearly $1.5 billion was much higher than projected, featuring higher earnings and a higher conversion of those net earnings. In all, a strong performance and the kind of balanced financial delivery we aimed for. Let's take a look at these metrics in more detail. We'll start with net sales growth on Slide number 11. On organic basis, net sales growth decelerated, as expected in quarter four, coming in at 2.5%. A few factors to point out, at home consumption growth rates around the world remain elevated, not decelerating as much as expected. Away from home declines remained in double digits, though not moderating as much as expected. We experienced adverse timing of shipments in certain categories in the U.S. relative to that sustained consumption growth and we experienced the business specific headwinds that we had anticipated, such as school closings in Northern Africa and October's civil unrest in Nigeria. Nevertheless, we saw organic growth in all four regions, again, in quarter four. Outside of organic basis growth, we saw adverse currency translation moderate from earlier in the year, reflecting the weakening of the U.S. dollar, since quarter three. And this year, our quarter four included an extra week, something we have every six fiscal year. For the full year, our organic net sales growth was 6%, featuring growth in both volume and price mix and with growth in all four regions and all four major category group, Snacks, Cereal, Frozen, and Noodles and other. A reasonable estimate for the net COVID impact, after its various puts and takes would suggest that it contributed about half of this organic net sales growth in 2020 putting our underlying growth at a very strong rate. Rounding out net sales growth for 2020, we roughly lost five percentage points from the absence of businesses, we had divested back in July 2019. Currency translation was offset by the impact of having the extra week in our fourth quarter. Now let's turn our discussion to profit margins with Slide number 12. As we've discussed, as we entered 2020, our goal was to stabilize gross profit margin, which would require offsetting a natural mix shift towards emerging markets, including our distributor business in Africa. We ended up doing better than that even as that mix shift continues. Specifically, our gross profit margin improved by 60 basis points year-on-year as operating leverage, revenue growth management and productivity initiatives more than offset the impact of more than $60 million of incremental direct COVID related costs. In the fourth quarter, gross margin leveled out because of shipment turning in the U.S. and some incremental costs, particularly in Latin America. But we are pleased with how we performed on this metric in 2020. Our operating profit margin also improved in 2020 but its quarter-by-quarter performance was greatly affected by the timing in our investment in advertising and consumer promotion. Recall that we postponed some advertising and a significant amount of consumer promotions during the first half. When sponsored events were canceled and the industry's focus was on getting food onto shelves. As you know, we decided to put that default spending to work in the second half, primarily in advertising, aimed at building brand equity and retaining household penetration. The result was double-digit increases year-on-year in A&P during quarter three and quarter four as increased advertising more than offset decreased consumer promotions. For total A&P, we finished 2020 right on our budget with a mid-single digit increase year-on-year. That brings us to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide number 13. Cash flow came in higher than anticipated throughout the year, a combination of our increased operating profits and reduced restructuring outlays along with good working capital management. The result was a significant improvement in our conversion ratio of net income into cash flow. As you know our priority for cash flow during 2019 and 2020, was to reduce our debt leverage after several years of acquisitions and restructuring outlays. This became all the more important as we entered an uncertain economic environment amidst the pandemic. Our stronger than expected cash flow allowed us to reduce debt faster than planned, right up to the $1.2 billion of debt we retired in December. This reduction in debt leverage gives us the financial flexibility to return more cash to share owners, as I'll discuss in just a moment. So let's now turn our attention to 2021 starting with Slide number 14. In forecasting our P&L for 2021, we ensured that we remained on track for steady balanced growth. Obviously, though, 2020 is an unusual base year to say the least. Not only did it have an extra shipping week in quarter four, but the pandemic created unusually high sales and operating leverage, especially in the first half and it also resulted in investment being shifted to the second half. Our stance was to plan for two year growth that keeps us on our strategic plan. Specifically, we planned around assumptions that result in two-year growth in organic net sales growth that is more than 2%; gross profit margin expansion on a two-year basis; and two-year growth in currency neutral operating profit of 3% to 4% excluding of divested businesses results from the 2019 base. Obviously, we've made planning assumptions around COVID, which are as follows. Underlying at home demand remains relatively elevated, but lapse unusual surges in quarter one and quarter two. Away from home demand remains depressed though moderating over the course of the year and emerging markets remaining growth though restrained by challenging macro conditions. But as you can see by the red bars on the slide, our underlying base business, excluding the divestiture COVID and the 53rd week, is expected to post another year of net sales and operating profit growth. And on a two-year basis, which effectively ignores the noise of 2020, we remain right on our strategic plan through 2021 and would call for similar balanced performance in 2022. Slide number 15 puts our 2021 guidance all together. Organic net sales are expected to be down about 1% year-on-year, reflecting the difficult comps in the first half. On a two-year compound annual growth though this translates to roughly 2.5% in line with a strategic plan I mentioned earlier. Adjusted operating profits on a currency neutral basis is projected to be down roughly 2% year-on-year, reflecting difficult comps in the first half related to last year's outsized operating leverage and delayed brand investment. On a two-year CAGR and excluding divested businesses from the 2019 base, this translates into roughly 3% to 4% growth in line with our strategic plan. Adjusted earnings per share on a currency neutral basis is expected to increase by approximately 1% year-on-year, aided by a decrease in interest expense caused by reduced debt and by lapping last year's debt redemption costs. On a two-year basis, excluding the impact of the divestiture from 2019 this implies about a 4% to 5% CAGR. Cash Flow is projected to be about $1.1 billion coming off 2020s exceptional $1.5 billion, but still significantly higher than 2019s cash flow of $600 million, which really was about 900 million when excluding the net of the divested businesses cash flow less the divestiture related tax and other outlays. This 2021 forecast is based on the earnings outlook and some timing of payments, such as performance based compensation accrued in 2020 but paid in 2021. Turning to Slide number 16, we entered 2021 in very solid financial condition. We had growth momentum across our region, as evidenced by consumption and share trends. We did not pull back on brand investment in 2020. So our brands are in good health. We benefited from strength and capabilities in digital data and analytics and ecommerce and we are well on our way to expanding capacity, where it's tight. We've improved our ability to convert income into cash flow and we deleveraged our balance sheet for increased financial flexibility. The combination of this improved business condition and enhanced financial flexibility enabled us to review share repurchases this year, after having refrained from them since quarter 1, 2019. In addition, we are increasing our quarterly dividend rate starting in quarter two. This means returning more cash to share owners and it reflects our confidence in the business. In summary, in 2020, we returned to balance growth between top-line margins, bottom-line and cash flow. We are confident that 2021 will be a continuation of this balanced growth, even if 2020s COVID impact and 53rd week create some noise on a one year basis. And with that, let me turn it back to Steve for a review of each of our major businesses.\nSteve Cahillane: Thanks, Amit. Let's begin with North America in Slide number 18. North America's organic net sales growth decelerated as expected in quarter four but in a different way than we projected. Consumption growth in retail channels decelerated only modestly, as another wave of the pandemic set in. However, related to this was less moderation of declines in a way from home channels and on-the-go products. In addition, we did experience some unexpected shipment timing in quarter four, which likely resulted in trade inventory decreases in certain categories in the U.S., notably crackers, cereal and affordable wholesome snacks. We don't think this is anything other than timing between quarters some of which should come back in quarter one. From a financial standpoint, the quarter and year featured balanced growth. On an organic basis, which excludes the impact of 2019s divestiture, but also 2020s 53rd week, Kellogg North America delivered 5% net sales growth in 2020, with both volume and price mix contributing. Meanwhile, we expanded the region's gross profit margin and grew operating profit even while increasing brand building investment to ensure we are retaining new households and adding to our brands long-term equity. No question it was a very strong year for Kellogg North America. Importantly, we saw growth across our category groups in 2020 as shown on Slide number 19. In each of these category groups, there were headwinds in the form of sharply lower away from home occasions and outlets as well as reduced on-the-go occasions. The good news is that elevated at home demand and a consumer preference for brands accelerated our retail channel growth in each of these category groups. This is a tribute to the strength of our brands, but also to the agility and execution of our team. Innovation launches were impeded but we still launched successes like jumbo snacks and cereal, expanded into new segments like we did with Incogmeato in alternatives and built on the runaway success of Cheez-It Snap'd. Marketing programs had to be postponed early in the year. So we revised our commercial plan, we shifted more of our brand building into advertising and we put to work in the second half the investment dollars we couldn't execute in the first half. Ecommerce growth accelerated throughout the industry in 2020 and our recent years investments and capability building paid off in the form of triple-digit growth in 2020. The result was more than 3% organic net sales growth for our largest business snacks, despite a lack of on-the-go occasions to go with notably strong 7% growth in cereal and 8% growth in Frozen, all despite declines in away from home channels. More important is our performance in market depicted on Slide number 20. As you can see, we held our gains share in four of our six primary categories in 2020, including in quarter four. Even in the two categories where we didn't outpace the category, we grew consumption at a double-digit rate. And this overall performance came despite running up against capacity on certain foods and despite having a sizable business and the types of on-the-go foods and pack formats that have declined during the pandemic. In cereal, we executed less promotional activity for Frosted Flakes in quarter four as we caught up on supply which held us back late in the year. But we're pleased with our overall consumption growth in 2020 and particularly by the responsiveness of key brands to new messaging, such as Mini-Wheats, Raisin Bran and Special K and to resume media support such as Apple Jacks and Corn Pops. In snacks, our share gain in crackers came from Cheez-It growth in both the base business and from the Snap'd innovations impressive year two performances. Pringles growth accelerated as the year progressed, gaining share in quarter four behind the strength of its standard size can and core four flavors. We grew consumption in a declining portable wholesome snacks category led by sustained momentum in Pop-Tarts, and Rice Krispies treats, as well as the resurgence of Nutri-Grain backed by its first media campaign in several years. In Frozen, Eggo continued to well outpace its Frozen from the griddle category. And in veggie foods, MorningStar Farms tested the bounds of capacity and growing consumption nearly 26% and it narrowed its gap to the surging category in quarter four as we increased its production. So clearly, we are competing well across our categories. A potentially lasting impact is the household penetration. We gained as shown on Slide number 21. With the exception of portable wholesome snacks, a category affected by reduced on-the-go occasions during the pandemic, we gained penetration in all of our categories. In fact, we outperformed our categories in this area in all but the Frozen veggie foods category, where we face capacity limitations and the entrance of new players. This increased penetration is promising for future growth and a big reason we elected to reinvest in our brands in the second half. Equally important is the fact that our velocities have increased across all our categories. As shown on Slide number 22, our velocities were already above those of almost all of our primary categories going into the year and they improved further in 2020. This is a very good sign regarding the health of our brands. In summary, North America enters 2021 in very good condition. Good in market fundamentals, well invested brands, momentum in ecommerce, a proven agility amidst very uncertain conditions, and better than expected financial performance. As we look to 2021, we will continue to relieve capacity constraints while continuing to invest in communicating to incremental households and resuming a full flight of innovation. While comparisons get a little distortive, especially between March and August, the results should be sustained in market momentum. Now let's discuss our international businesses starting with Europe on Slide number 24. For Kellogg Europe, quarter four was our 13th consecutive quarter of organic net sales growth. A resurgence in COVID cases and restrictions, reaccelerated cereal categories across the region and we gained share overall by outpacing the category in four of our top five markets. This was led by a particularly impressive performance in the U.K., and by some of our biggest brands in the region, like Crunchy Nut, Tresor and Extra. Importantly, our snacks business returned to growth in quarter four. Recall that in quarter two and quarter three, we'd experienced softness in snack shipments related to COVID and difficult economic conditions in markets like Russia, and then a canceled Euro Cup soccer tournament made it more difficult to lap previous year's enormously successful Pringles summer marketing programs. During quarter four, our Pringles business rebounded nicely. And we finished 2020 with a collective share gain in our top eight markets led by each of our top three markets, the U.K., Germany and Russia. From a financial perspective, it was a strong year for Kellogg Europe, even amidst disruptions and costs related to COVID. In addition to the strong 5% organic net sales growth, our gross profit margin improved, allowing us to increase brand investment and still deliver strong operating profit growth, even excluding the 53rd week. So Europe enters 2021 with good momentum. Our snacks business is on the upswing and we have exciting innovation planned for Pringles including a line of sizzling hot flavors and our commercial plan includes exciting activation around gaming and the rescheduled Euro Cup soccer tournament. While cereal categories will likely decelerate as COVID passes and mobility increases, we are actively investing to retain new households gained. We have a great commercial plan, including a multi-brand campaign around wellbeing the launch of a Strawberry Cocoa Puffs and a strong digital activation around key brands like Crunchy Nut, Extra and Tresor just to name a few. Russia and Central and Eastern Europe remain promising opportunities for expansion even amidst the challenging environment presented by COVID and economic slowdown. We look to reaccelerate growth in this business in 2021. Let's turn to Latin America in Slide number 26. We had another strong quarter in this region. Its quarter four profit decline had been expected owing to some one-off costs related to Mexico labeling regulations and a significant year-on-year increase in brand building. What was impressive was its ability to sustain very strong top-line growth amidst challenging conditions and delivered double-digit operating profit growth for the year. Cereal category growth rates in the region continued to decelerate but remained at elevated levels. We outpaced the category in key markets including Mexico, Puerto Rico, Central America and Argentina. The result was strong net sales growth for cereal across all of our sub regions. Our snacks business saw improvement again in quarter four, accelerating our net sales growth in Latin America, even as these categories remain under pressure amidst COVID and economic softness. Pringles posted strong consumption growth and share performance led by Mexico and by Brazil, which continues to benefit from local production in a new strategic distributor. Also in Brazil, our Parati business continues to gain share in cookies and powder drinks. So Kellogg, Latin America has momentum going into 2021. Snacks growth should be led by continued momentum in Pringles, which is in a good position to build on its expansion in Brazil and adding to our snacks offerings, we've just launched Cheez-It in that market. In cereal, we assume continued deceleration in the pandemic related consumption growth and we continue to navigate through Mexico's regulatory environment. Nevertheless, we have good plans in place and aim to continue to outpace our categories. And we'll finish with a discussion about EMEA shown on Slide number 28. As we told you a few months ago, our business in this region faced two primary headwinds in the form of civil unrest that disrupted all commerce in Nigeria during the last couple of weeks of October and school closings in Northern Africa, which effectively canceled a sizable biscuits business for us in quarter four. Together, these likely expect about five percentage points off EMEAs Q4 net sales growth. But behind these known disruptions, we continued positive performance. We continue to grow our noodles and other business in Africa and the Middle East, with momentum sustained through the fourth quarter and full year net sales approaching a billion dollars. This gives our portfolio a low price point staple with terrific opportunity for continued growth. In cereal, we continued to outpace category growth in the regions behind effective commercial programs, led by strong share performance in markets ranging from Australia and Korea to India and South Africa. Pringles net sales grew on the strength of double-digit consumption growth in quarter four, outpacing the category overall in the region, with notable share gains in markets like Australia, Korea and South Africa. It was the rest of our snacks business that felt the brunt of the net sales headwinds I mentioned earlier, resulting in the overall snacks decline you see on this slide. Financially, it was a quarter of good balance growth, net sales growth, improved gross profit margin and growth in operating profit even with a significant year-on-year increase in brand building investment. The quarter finishes what was another impressive year for EMEA, especially given the environment. Like our other regions, EMEA has experienced elevated cereal consumption, giving us the opportunity to retain consumers with the right messaging and innovation while continuing to expand penetration in emerging markets. While other parts of our snacks businesses were interrupted by various COVID impacts, Pringles continues to show good momentum heading into the New Year and we continued to grow our business in Africa and the Middle East, with noodles giving us a third growth engine to go along with cereal and snacks. Let's wrap up with a brief summary on Slide number 31. In a year unlike any other, we are proud of the way our organization rallied to execute through unprecedented and challenging conditions. First, we've managed well through crisis. We've kept each other safe, supplying the marketplace with food and aiding our communities. The crisis is not over and we will continue to focus on these areas. Second, we improved our competitive positions in 2020. We expanded household penetration by more than our categories, grew consumption across key markets, brands and retail channels notably in ecommerce, we held our gains share in categories that represent nearly 85% of our company's net sales in those measured markets. And we increased our brand investment for the year, even after some of it had to be delayed during the first half. Third, we sustained strong growth in emerging markets in spite of challenging conditions. In fact, we accelerated our growth in these markets. This is a credit to our experienced management teams, our diversified geographic footprint, our local supply chains and the breadth of our portfolio. Fourth, we delivered better than expected financial results. We twice raised our full year outlook and ultimately delivered on that guidance. We accelerated our organic net sales growth even without COVID and in a nod to balanced delivery, we expanded our gross profit margin in spite of incremental COVID costs and ongoing mix shifts towards emerging markets. We delivered operating profit growth and EPS growth even despite the impact of last year's major divestiture. And finally, we improved our financial flexibility. We generated stronger than expected cash flow, allowing us to pay down debt faster than anticipated. So we enter 2021, a stronger company. Our outlook keeps us on a two year trajectory that is right on our strategic plan. We have a strong commercial plan that builds on the increased consumer communication of 2020 and returns to broader activation and a more complete innovation launch calendar, all aimed at retaining households and continuing to improve our share across categories. We continue to invest in capacities that will enable us to catch up to demand and because of our improved financial flexibility, we are returning to share buybacks and dividend increases earlier than anticipated. Our goal is sustained balance between top-line and cash flow growth and we are on firmer footing now more than ever. I'd like to really thank our employees for their hard work and dedication. And with that, we'll now open it up for your questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session with publishing analysts. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Eric Larson with Seaport Global Securities.\nEric Larson: Congratulations on a good year, Steve. What I'd really like to focus on is kind of your guidance for organic sales growth. Obviously, there were a lot of twists and takes, in the year, but obviously, you're going to have some sort of resurgence in things like your European soccer program with Pringles. It seems like your comps in some cases are easier, despite the fact that obviously North America have benefited from, at home consumption increases. But can you give us a little more clarity on the away from home side and why that may or may not be stronger?\nSteve Cahillane: There's a lot of puts and takes when you think about 2021 guidance versus 2020, which is why we keep going back to 2019, ex-divestiture and talking about that as kind of a pretty relevant base year and looking at a two-year CAGR. Because when you look at areas like away from home, which will recover and on-the-go consumption, which will recover, that's going to offset some deceleration that we're seeing, but because you're not going to have another surge in March and elevated demands like April and May, it's going to remain elevated versus 2019 but not at the same levels as 2021. Getting back to away from home, the reason we think that will recover slightly more slowly for us is because we over index and travel leisure, areas like that, which we think will recover more slowly, travel won't come back quite as quickly as perhaps, people going to the office and being on-the-go. So lots of puts and takes in terms of what's going to happen by brand, by category by geography. And the biggest COVID impacts that we saw were clearly North America, Europe, very proud of what the team did in Europe in pivoting away from the Euro soccer championship and towards gaming, we do think that soccer will come -- we're hopeful that soccer will come back in some ways in 2021. So there's a lot in the guidance, but what we have really done is try COVID impacts in 2020, as we think about 2021, look at the 2019 base and put together winning plans, by category, by geography, by brand that gets us exactly to where we are today, when we talk about the 2021 guidance and rolls up into the net sales operating profit, EPS that we that we talked about. So I don't know Amit, if you want to add anything to that.\nAmit Banati: No. I think, like you said, Steve, our focus, at least from a planning stance was to look at it from a two year standpoint. And if you kind of look at the two year CAGRs, they are of off a growth standpoint, 2.5% on the top-line 3% to 4% on the bottom-line, and then on the EPS 4% to 5%.\nEric Larson: Okay. A quick follow up, marketing spend as a percent of sales for this year. Are you reinvesting more in sales, or is it going to be more in line with sales?\nSteve Cahillane: No, we're going to be pretty flattish. So we've talked about brand building, being exactly where we think it needs to be overall. And we like where we are. We like the way we were positioned, as we said, in the last call, that we would keep our brand building pretty much at budget in 2020, which meant a big shift from the first half to the second half, for what are now obvious reasons. So we'll smooth that out in 2021. But we know we don't need a big resurgence, we like where we are in terms of investing in our brands. We'd like the way we're exiting this year, with the equity that we built in the brand and the money that we spent behind the brands. Now you look across our categories and what we've done, with all of our big brands, we feel very good about where we are.\nOperator: The next question is from Alexia Howard with Bernstein.\nAlexia Howard: You mentioned the pullback in promotional activity on frosted flakes. I imagine that might have contributed to some of the share declines that we're seeing more recently in the U.S. cereal category. When does that get overcome? When do the capacity constraint? And what do you expect to see improved share trends performance, over the next few months? Thank you and I'll pass it on.\nSteve Cahillane: We were capacity constrained as we exited the year, nobody anticipated obviously, the type of year that cereal would have, no category grew nearly 9%, slowed down a little bit in the second half, but still five, six percentage growth. So we work very hard all year to keep up with demand and keep our service levels as high as we possibly could. And we ended the year with a flat share performance slipped a little in the fourth quarter, as you noted, almost all of that slippage was due to Frosted Flakes, where, because of capacity, we had to back away from promotions, you can see that in the syndicated data, down 20% in incremental sales, because we couldn't execute against the mission Tiger program and we wanted to keep our service levels, where retailers deserve them to be. So we didn't give up promotional slots. And nearly all of our share declined in the fourth quarter was due to Frosted Flakes. Now as we enter 2021, we continue to build against capacity, we continue to make good improvements. And we continue to be very optimistic as we go through the first half of this year, we're going to get better and better in terms of that capacity. And therefore, we'll get better and better in terms of our sheer performance.\nOperator: The next question is from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.\nRobert Moskow: Amit, I'd like to ask about your inflation exposure in 2021. What kind of a step up do you expect in cost inflation? And to what extent do your hedges protect you? And then actually, I do have a question about the two year metrics here. A lot of your peers are saying that the COVID benefits are allowing them to outperform their two-year targets, your guidance implies that you're on track. Is there any reason why you wouldn't step things up in your 2021 outlook to reflect above trends given velocity is higher than you thought and household penetration is higher than you thought?\nAmit Banati: Okay. So let me start with the first question on commodities. I think we closed out 2020 with input cost inflation in the mid-single digits. And this was mostly offset by the productivity all the way through quarter four. I think we have seen green and energy markets rebound sharply in recent months, just on near term supply, demand and other factors. I think from our exchange traded commodity standpoint, we are well hedged through the first half of 2021 and roughly around 70% level of hedging coverage for the year. So I think, in terms of total inflation for 2021, we expect that to be higher than what we've experienced in 2020 but still in the mid-single digit rates. And I think we'd be looking to offset that with our usual productivity programs, with revenue growth management. And overall, as we've guided, we'd expect our gross margin to be up on a two-year basis, obviously, in this in 2020, our gross margin was up 60 basis points. And on a two-year basis, we'd still expect gross margins to be up and from a '21 standpoint, we'd be aiming for our gross margins to be stable.\nRobert Moskow: And then, the two-year?\nAmit Banati: Steve, you want to talk two-year?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. So Robert, as we looked at it, we aim to do better, right, but there's a lot of uncertainty. And recall, we returned to grow through a deploy for growth strategy. So it gets us back to where we said we would be and where we wanted to be based on our strategic planning stance. It could be better in retail, it could be better in certain categories, it could be slightly worse in a way from home depending on how that recovery happens. So we think it's a prudent planning stance but as we always say, we aim to do better and hopefully we will.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Growe with Stifel.\nChris Growe: I had two quick questions here and a bit of follow-ons in each case. The first one just is in relation to the surge in sales that we saw and you to help to find that Amit in terms of 2020 from COVID. Have you and looking for like a high level viewpoint here but like how much of those incremental sales or share you gained some categories do you start to hold on to? So that was my first question. The second one was in related to that, as we look across a number of year categories, there were some areas where you had clear market share gains through the year, really through the year, but especially in the fourth quarter, and we have seen market share losses in particular in the U.S., and I'm looking mostly measured channels here, some market share losses there. So I wanted to just kind of bring that back around to that concept about keeping marketing flat this year. In areas where you've had some share pressure, do you need to increase your marketing and press is part of the plan in 2021?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes, Chris. So I'll start first, as we've said, in the past, our goal is to always gain share. And so we finished the year globally with holding or gaining share in over 80% of our category, country combinations, where there's measured data, so we feel good about that. In terms of the U.S., in particular, which you referenced, I did talk about the U.S. Rtech, where we held share for the full year, but we lost 50 basis points a share in the fourth quarter much of that due to capacity limitations that we had which I already mentioned. And so, our plan for 2021, we think in Rtech in ready to eat cereal is a winning plan. But if I look at some of the other categories for the full year and even the fourth quarter, if you look at the U.S. snacks business in and crackers, we gained share for the full year and we gained share in the fourth quarter. So we gained 50 basis points of cracker share in the fourth quarter in salty, which the category was explosive in the full year, gained about 12.5 of volume, we were up 11. So, based on our size, down ever so slightly but in the fourth quarter actually, we performed nearly 15% growth against the category of 10%. So we actually even did better in salty, our Pringles business. If I look at the portable wholesome snacks category, obviously a lot of on-the-go, so a category that was under pressure. For the full year and the fourth quarter, we had tremendous share performances. So we gained 250 basis points a share for the full year, 390 basis points in the fourth quarter, and that was great performance by Pop-Tarts, Rice Krispies treats, Nutri-Grain returned to growth in the fourth quarter. And then, if I look at Frozen, from the Griddle or Eggo business, obviously, terrific year, again, some capacity limitations for us but we gained 150 basis points of share in the fourth quarter, which was better than our -- is online with our full year performance. And then finally, on the vegan, which has got a lot of attention, because it's an explosive growth category. We were capacity constrained again there because nobody planned for the type of explosive growth. But we were up for the full year 24%, which wasn't enough to gain share, we lost, one basis point a share. But in the fourth quarter, we did better. We cut that share decline more than in half, we lost 40 basis points and we're up 20%. So that's a pretty good performance there. So in the categories where we didn't gain share, we were still growing double digits is another way to look at it. So that's why we like where our brand building is, we think it's been very, very productive. We measure every ROI by brand by category. And we think we entered 2021 with a lot of good momentum in our brands, in our categories and a good outlook for share performance in 2021.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler.\nMichael Lavery: I was just wondering if you could touch on some of the thinking around guidance a little bit. It's pretty specific to not have a range for a full year with this amount of uncertainty. And so I guess maybe two parts. One is, what are some of your assumptions around things like lapping 2Q '20, the timing of buybacks what are some of the key moving parts and how you're thinking about them? Or I guess the other part of it is, you gave the progression of your guidance last year, you raised it a few times, is this more, kind of like how we should think about the low end of a guidance range with something above this? Just put that all in context for us please?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes, Michael, thanks. I'll start and turn it over to Amit as well. We've tried to be transparent as best as we possibly could, in an unprecedented environment, right. And so this guidance, I would say, is the best that we can do. And it's down the middle of the fairway. So, it could be better, it could have more challenges depending on how things recover and what happens in emerging markets. But we feel and don't -- we don't want to be falsely precise. And say, we know exactly what's going to happen in these uncertain times. But we want to maintain our transparency, we want to share with you what our planning stances are in terms of what we think will recover, how it will recover, and how our brands category, country combinations will perform. And again, we triangulate it, we look back at 2020 actual, what we had planned for 2020, pre-COVID, a 2019 base year ex the divestiture what our strategic planning intentions were and therefore what we wanted to accomplish in 2021 and what we thought we could accomplish in 2021. And those are the points that we landed on. And so again, trying to be transparent and trying to hit it down the middle of the fairway, I'd say is kind of the way I'd characterize the guidance. Amit, do you want to add any?\nAmit Banati: No. I think Steve; you've covered it, on the clock. It's in line with our internal plans. And I talked about underlying at home demand remaining elevated. But no question, we will have to lap last year's surges, particularly in March. And it's interesting, as we've gone into further lockdowns, we haven't seen that panic buying that we saw in March. So that's something that we'll have to lap. On away from home, we've assumed that, it is moderate. But over the course of the year and sitting here today they still remain depressed. So that's the assumption. And then from emerging market standpoint, we had a relatively strong year in 2020. So we're continuing to plan on growth in emerging markets. But we've been cautious and prudent in terms of the macro conditions in emerging markets. So I think those are some of the assumptions and the way we've approached the guidance.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks. Can I sneak in a quick follow up on MorningStar capacity? Do you know when you would get relief for that there?\nSteve Cahillane: We're catching up right now. So we're in good shape. The Incogmeato launch continues to go forward. We're adding chick flavors to that, we got some great innovations around chicken. And so we feel good about where the capacity is right now relative to the demand.\nOperator: The next question is from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies.\nRob Dickerson: I guess, kind of first question around your operating profit dollars, then also for cash flow dollars, if I looked at kind of where that might come in, or where they came in 2020, where it might come in '21. Frankly, it's not that much different then we saw, let's say 35 years ago and I realized a number of moving pieces. So, Steve a big piece of this strategic playbook has been reinvesting for growth that's the theme and you're getting there. Gross profit margin still better but we obviously haven't seen a lot of operating profit margin, which can obviously help your free cash flow grow over time. If we step way back, how do you think about getting that free cash flow piece to grow, the gross margin is good, the investment is good, doing all the right things. But name of the game is to get more cash in the business to kind of how do you kind of right size that as you think forward a few years? Then, I have a quick follow up. Thanks.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes, thanks. I'll start and Amit has got definitely some things to add there. But I'd start by reminding you obviously, the divestiture, big divestiture. So when you look back and look at the numbers and say cash flow, or overall I think you said, absolute OP dollars, there's going to be a big difference because of that divestiture. And if I think about, where we finish the year, so organic net sales of plus 6%, Forex neutral adjusted OP of 3.5%, Forex adjusted EPS of 2.3% and a cash flow of 1.5 billion. That's a terrific year, I think under any set of circumstances and based on the guidance that we gave in 2021, to your question around cash, it's substantially better than the 2019 performance. And remember, there's some outflows of cash that happened whether it be incentives, whether it be other release of accruals that were accrued for in 2020. And the cash will actually outflow in 2021, which is why I think it's, again, useful to look at a two year comparison on everything, including the cash flow performance, which continues to get better. And so as we exit this year, that's why we're very confident that as a company from a top-line through a balanced bottom-line delivery standpoint, we are a much stronger company. And we come out of this pandemic and we enter 2021 in a much stronger position from a balance sheet perspective and from a top-line potential perspective as well. Amit, do you want to build on that?\nAmit Banati: Well, I think, from a two-year standpoint you're looking at organic growth, 2.5% on the top-line and then EPS growth at around 4% to 5%. And then the cash flow conversion, we've had an exceptional year of cash flow conversion in 2020, now to 100%. I think in 2021, there are some timing differences. So, some of the accruals will be paid out in 2021. But our conversion, even in 2021, we're targeting, in the mid 70s to 80% conversion. And then, if you adjust for the pension income that runs through our P&L, that's about 15% adjustment, it gets us to go high 90s. So, I think from an overall standpoint it's balanced. In 2020, we demonstrated, we delivered balanced delivery and certainly the guidance for 2021 calls for that for another year of that.\nRob Dickerson: And then, just quickly on Incogmeato. Obviously, I think you're either somewhat past the upfront trial phase seems like we've got [indiscernible] distribution, good trial, as you think forward, let's say next nine months, as we kind of near the grilling season. I'm assuming there'll be some pent up demand for consumers to get back outside to do that. Is there anything strategically that -- you can do to just further kind of drive increased household penetration? And I just ask, given, obviously, all the incremental competition that already exists within the retail channel? Thanks.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. So Rob, I'd start by just reminding all of us that Incogmeato launched during the pandemic, so very difficult time to launch. But having said that, we're happy with where we are. And it also remind us that it is a sub-brand of MorningStar Farms. And MorningStar Farms finished the year with 25% consumption growth. So hardly a brand that's been disrupted but clearly a brand that is doing very, very well, despite some of the capacity constraints that I mentioned. Having said that, we did launch Incogmeato, we're up to about a 4 point share. When we look at our velocities relative to some of the smaller players, we're exceeding those velocities. When we look at the velocities compared to early MorningStar Farm launches at the same stage. We're ahead of those velocities as well. And as I said, we've got these chicken offerings, including Disney royalty chicken offerings that are coming to the fore right now. So we feel very good about where the whole MorningStar Farms performance is. And we continue to innovate around MorningStar Farms, but also Incogmeato, we're bullish about this and 25% consumption growth is pretty good.\nJohn Renwick: We are at the end of time. If you do have follow up questions, please do not hesitate to call and thank you everyone for your interest and time this morning.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve Cahillane",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are holding up well in these turbulent times. Certainly, 2020 was an extraordinary year and I'm incredibly proud of how our organization responded to and executed during a business environment that was anything but business as usual. Keeping our employees safe remains job one and this has required investment and changes to the way we work. Supplying the marketplace with food required agility, contingency planning and creative ways to increase production. Not to mention the courage and dedication of our frontline workers. In aiding our communities a key element of our company's culture and legacy was accelerated during the crisis and it has been especially heartwarming to see our employees giving their time and effort to the cause. We also preserved and improved our financial flexibility. These have been our priorities during the crisis and we've been executing well against all of them. And even while having execute against crisis management priorities, we also over delivered on our financial commitments. We did our best to provide you with guidance during the year despite an uncertain environment. And I trust that transparency was helpful to you. We ended up raising that guidance twice during the year, ultimately hitting or exceeding that guidance with our quarter four and full year results even after absorbing $20 million in one-time costs related to redeeming debt late in the year. This is the kind of dependability we are striving for. We set out this year to return to balance financial growth, meaning balance between top-line growth, margin expansion and cash flow conversion. And sure enough through all the unusual impacts divestiture impact, COVID impacts, 53rd week, we did return to balance financial growth in 2020. Strong organic net sales growth even if you exclude a reasonable estimate for COVID net benefit and expansion in gross profit margin despite incremental COVID-related costs; growth and operating profit even despite losing about six percentage points from the mechanical impact of last year's divestiture; a better than expected increase in cash flow featuring a significantly improved conversion of net income; even excluding COVID net benefits we returned to balance financial growth in 2020 right on schedule. We executed very well in market. The pandemic presented us with a sampling event like none other and we saw increases in household penetration that outpaced most of our categories, giving us an excellent opportunity to communicate to and retain new and lapsed consumers. And we outgrew most of our categories holding or gaining share of categories representing more than 80% of our net sales in those measured markets. Our emerging markets are a key long-term growth driver for us and they represent over 20% of our net sales. In 2020 they were severely tested by pandemic related shutdowns, economic slowdowns, even social unrest and yet they delivered high single digit organic net sales growth for us in 2020, even accelerating from the prior two years growth rates. This is a real testament to our portfolio, our local supply chains and our experienced management teams in these markets. In short, the business performed very well in 2020 and we will take that momentum into 2021. Throughout the crisis, we have been working to ensure that there are lasting impacts from 2020 that should increase confidence in our ability to deliver consistent, dependable balanced growth over time. I'll discuss just a few of them here. One is communicating with new and lapsed households. Rather than giving up on A&P, we couldn't execute in the first half. We shifted that budget and investment to the second half, focusing on advertising to these new and lapsed users. And we've leveraged advanced data and analytics to target those households and occasions. This gives us our best opportunity to retain an expanded consumer base. We know that online shopping for food experienced a step change in 2020. Our triple digit growth in ecommerce sales was made possible by the brands in our portfolio and by our recent years investment in infrastructure and capabilities. This will continue to benefit us. We're investing in our supply chain. This includes sustaining enhanced safety protocols that carry with them higher costs. But the crisis also resulted in us increasing our supply chains agility and reducing complexity with the exiting of certain non-core product lines and tail SKUs. And it accelerated our expansion of capacity in areas that were already tight before this pandemic hit. This two will benefit us in 2021 and beyond. Enhanced financial flexibility is another lasting benefit. Improved cash flow generation and the prioritization of debt reduction resulted in deleveraging our balance sheet faster than we had anticipated. As Amit will discuss in a moment, this financial flexibility puts us in a position to resume dividend increases and share repurchases earlier than previously planned, returning more cash to share owners. And lastly, we remained solidly on track for consistent balanced growth. Even amidst the crisis, our focus was on what is best for sustainable growth. In addition to sustaining our solid top-line growth, we have organizational focus on improving gross profit margin, increasing the return on our brand building investment and discipline on overhead. There will be noise and uncertainty around the pandemic and its impacts. But in the spirit of transparency, we will continue to provide you guidance on our planning stance today. Our guidance for 2021 indicates balanced growth on a two year basis, attempting to smooth out 2020s unusual events and to ensure that we remain on our balanced trajectory. So with that, let me turn it over to Amit, who will take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail. Thanks, Amit. Let's begin with North America in Slide number 18. North America's organic net sales growth decelerated as expected in quarter four but in a different way than we projected. Consumption growth in retail channels decelerated only modestly, as another wave of the pandemic set in. However, related to this was less moderation of declines in a way from home channels and on-the-go products. In addition, we did experience some unexpected shipment timing in quarter four, which likely resulted in trade inventory decreases in certain categories in the U.S., notably crackers, cereal and affordable wholesome snacks. We don't think this is anything other than timing between quarters some of which should come back in quarter one. From a financial standpoint, the quarter and year featured balanced growth. On an organic basis, which excludes the impact of 2019s divestiture, but also 2020s 53rd week, Kellogg North America delivered 5% net sales growth in 2020, with both volume and price mix contributing. Meanwhile, we expanded the region's gross profit margin and grew operating profit even while increasing brand building investment to ensure we are retaining new households and adding to our brands long-term equity. No question it was a very strong year for Kellogg North America. Importantly, we saw growth across our category groups in 2020 as shown on Slide number 19. In each of these category groups, there were headwinds in the form of sharply lower away from home occasions and outlets as well as reduced on-the-go occasions. The good news is that elevated at home demand and a consumer preference for brands accelerated our retail channel growth in each of these category groups. This is a tribute to the strength of our brands, but also to the agility and execution of our team. Innovation launches were impeded but we still launched successes like jumbo snacks and cereal, expanded into new segments like we did with Incogmeato in alternatives and built on the runaway success of Cheez-It Snap'd. Marketing programs had to be postponed early in the year. So we revised our commercial plan, we shifted more of our brand building into advertising and we put to work in the second half the investment dollars we couldn't execute in the first half. Ecommerce growth accelerated throughout the industry in 2020 and our recent years investments and capability building paid off in the form of triple-digit growth in 2020. The result was more than 3% organic net sales growth for our largest business snacks, despite a lack of on-the-go occasions to go with notably strong 7% growth in cereal and 8% growth in Frozen, all despite declines in away from home channels. More important is our performance in market depicted on Slide number 20. As you can see, we held our gains share in four of our six primary categories in 2020, including in quarter four. Even in the two categories where we didn't outpace the category, we grew consumption at a double-digit rate. And this overall performance came despite running up against capacity on certain foods and despite having a sizable business and the types of on-the-go foods and pack formats that have declined during the pandemic. In cereal, we executed less promotional activity for Frosted Flakes in quarter four as we caught up on supply which held us back late in the year. But we're pleased with our overall consumption growth in 2020 and particularly by the responsiveness of key brands to new messaging, such as Mini-Wheats, Raisin Bran and Special K and to resume media support such as Apple Jacks and Corn Pops. In snacks, our share gain in crackers came from Cheez-It growth in both the base business and from the Snap'd innovations impressive year two performances. Pringles growth accelerated as the year progressed, gaining share in quarter four behind the strength of its standard size can and core four flavors. We grew consumption in a declining portable wholesome snacks category led by sustained momentum in Pop-Tarts, and Rice Krispies treats, as well as the resurgence of Nutri-Grain backed by its first media campaign in several years. In Frozen, Eggo continued to well outpace its Frozen from the griddle category. And in veggie foods, MorningStar Farms tested the bounds of capacity and growing consumption nearly 26% and it narrowed its gap to the surging category in quarter four as we increased its production. So clearly, we are competing well across our categories. A potentially lasting impact is the household penetration. We gained as shown on Slide number 21. With the exception of portable wholesome snacks, a category affected by reduced on-the-go occasions during the pandemic, we gained penetration in all of our categories. In fact, we outperformed our categories in this area in all but the Frozen veggie foods category, where we face capacity limitations and the entrance of new players. This increased penetration is promising for future growth and a big reason we elected to reinvest in our brands in the second half. Equally important is the fact that our velocities have increased across all our categories. As shown on Slide number 22, our velocities were already above those of almost all of our primary categories going into the year and they improved further in 2020. This is a very good sign regarding the health of our brands. In summary, North America enters 2021 in very good condition. Good in market fundamentals, well invested brands, momentum in ecommerce, a proven agility amidst very uncertain conditions, and better than expected financial performance. As we look to 2021, we will continue to relieve capacity constraints while continuing to invest in communicating to incremental households and resuming a full flight of innovation. While comparisons get a little distortive, especially between March and August, the results should be sustained in market momentum. Now let's discuss our international businesses starting with Europe on Slide number 24. For Kellogg Europe, quarter four was our 13th consecutive quarter of organic net sales growth. A resurgence in COVID cases and restrictions, reaccelerated cereal categories across the region and we gained share overall by outpacing the category in four of our top five markets. This was led by a particularly impressive performance in the U.K., and by some of our biggest brands in the region, like Crunchy Nut, Tresor and Extra. Importantly, our snacks business returned to growth in quarter four. Recall that in quarter two and quarter three, we'd experienced softness in snack shipments related to COVID and difficult economic conditions in markets like Russia, and then a canceled Euro Cup soccer tournament made it more difficult to lap previous year's enormously successful Pringles summer marketing programs. During quarter four, our Pringles business rebounded nicely. And we finished 2020 with a collective share gain in our top eight markets led by each of our top three markets, the U.K., Germany and Russia. From a financial perspective, it was a strong year for Kellogg Europe, even amidst disruptions and costs related to COVID. In addition to the strong 5% organic net sales growth, our gross profit margin improved, allowing us to increase brand investment and still deliver strong operating profit growth, even excluding the 53rd week. So Europe enters 2021 with good momentum. Our snacks business is on the upswing and we have exciting innovation planned for Pringles including a line of sizzling hot flavors and our commercial plan includes exciting activation around gaming and the rescheduled Euro Cup soccer tournament. While cereal categories will likely decelerate as COVID passes and mobility increases, we are actively investing to retain new households gained. We have a great commercial plan, including a multi-brand campaign around wellbeing the launch of a Strawberry Cocoa Puffs and a strong digital activation around key brands like Crunchy Nut, Extra and Tresor just to name a few. Russia and Central and Eastern Europe remain promising opportunities for expansion even amidst the challenging environment presented by COVID and economic slowdown. We look to reaccelerate growth in this business in 2021. Let's turn to Latin America in Slide number 26. We had another strong quarter in this region. Its quarter four profit decline had been expected owing to some one-off costs related to Mexico labeling regulations and a significant year-on-year increase in brand building. What was impressive was its ability to sustain very strong top-line growth amidst challenging conditions and delivered double-digit operating profit growth for the year. Cereal category growth rates in the region continued to decelerate but remained at elevated levels. We outpaced the category in key markets including Mexico, Puerto Rico, Central America and Argentina. The result was strong net sales growth for cereal across all of our sub regions. Our snacks business saw improvement again in quarter four, accelerating our net sales growth in Latin America, even as these categories remain under pressure amidst COVID and economic softness. Pringles posted strong consumption growth and share performance led by Mexico and by Brazil, which continues to benefit from local production in a new strategic distributor. Also in Brazil, our Parati business continues to gain share in cookies and powder drinks. So Kellogg, Latin America has momentum going into 2021. Snacks growth should be led by continued momentum in Pringles, which is in a good position to build on its expansion in Brazil and adding to our snacks offerings, we've just launched Cheez-It in that market. In cereal, we assume continued deceleration in the pandemic related consumption growth and we continue to navigate through Mexico's regulatory environment. Nevertheless, we have good plans in place and aim to continue to outpace our categories. And we'll finish with a discussion about EMEA shown on Slide number 28. As we told you a few months ago, our business in this region faced two primary headwinds in the form of civil unrest that disrupted all commerce in Nigeria during the last couple of weeks of October and school closings in Northern Africa, which effectively canceled a sizable biscuits business for us in quarter four. Together, these likely expect about five percentage points off EMEAs Q4 net sales growth. But behind these known disruptions, we continued positive performance. We continue to grow our noodles and other business in Africa and the Middle East, with momentum sustained through the fourth quarter and full year net sales approaching a billion dollars. This gives our portfolio a low price point staple with terrific opportunity for continued growth. In cereal, we continued to outpace category growth in the regions behind effective commercial programs, led by strong share performance in markets ranging from Australia and Korea to India and South Africa. Pringles net sales grew on the strength of double-digit consumption growth in quarter four, outpacing the category overall in the region, with notable share gains in markets like Australia, Korea and South Africa. It was the rest of our snacks business that felt the brunt of the net sales headwinds I mentioned earlier, resulting in the overall snacks decline you see on this slide. Financially, it was a quarter of good balance growth, net sales growth, improved gross profit margin and growth in operating profit even with a significant year-on-year increase in brand building investment. The quarter finishes what was another impressive year for EMEA, especially given the environment. Like our other regions, EMEA has experienced elevated cereal consumption, giving us the opportunity to retain consumers with the right messaging and innovation while continuing to expand penetration in emerging markets. While other parts of our snacks businesses were interrupted by various COVID impacts, Pringles continues to show good momentum heading into the New Year and we continued to grow our business in Africa and the Middle East, with noodles giving us a third growth engine to go along with cereal and snacks. Let's wrap up with a brief summary on Slide number 31. In a year unlike any other, we are proud of the way our organization rallied to execute through unprecedented and challenging conditions. First, we've managed well through crisis. We've kept each other safe, supplying the marketplace with food and aiding our communities. The crisis is not over and we will continue to focus on these areas. Second, we improved our competitive positions in 2020. We expanded household penetration by more than our categories, grew consumption across key markets, brands and retail channels notably in ecommerce, we held our gains share in categories that represent nearly 85% of our company's net sales in those measured markets. And we increased our brand investment for the year, even after some of it had to be delayed during the first half. Third, we sustained strong growth in emerging markets in spite of challenging conditions. In fact, we accelerated our growth in these markets. This is a credit to our experienced management teams, our diversified geographic footprint, our local supply chains and the breadth of our portfolio. Fourth, we delivered better than expected financial results. We twice raised our full year outlook and ultimately delivered on that guidance. We accelerated our organic net sales growth even without COVID and in a nod to balanced delivery, we expanded our gross profit margin in spite of incremental COVID costs and ongoing mix shifts towards emerging markets. We delivered operating profit growth and EPS growth even despite the impact of last year's major divestiture. And finally, we improved our financial flexibility. We generated stronger than expected cash flow, allowing us to pay down debt faster than anticipated. So we enter 2021, a stronger company. Our outlook keeps us on a two year trajectory that is right on our strategic plan. We have a strong commercial plan that builds on the increased consumer communication of 2020 and returns to broader activation and a more complete innovation launch calendar, all aimed at retaining households and continuing to improve our share across categories. We continue to invest in capacities that will enable us to catch up to demand and because of our improved financial flexibility, we are returning to share buybacks and dividend increases earlier than anticipated. Our goal is sustained balance between top-line and cash flow growth and we are on firmer footing now more than ever. I'd like to really thank our employees for their hard work and dedication. And with that, we'll now open it up for your questions. There's a lot of puts and takes when you think about 2021 guidance versus 2020, which is why we keep going back to 2019, ex-divestiture and talking about that as kind of a pretty relevant base year and looking at a two-year CAGR. Because when you look at areas like away from home, which will recover and on-the-go consumption, which will recover, that's going to offset some deceleration that we're seeing, but because you're not going to have another surge in March and elevated demands like April and May, it's going to remain elevated versus 2019 but not at the same levels as 2021. Getting back to away from home, the reason we think that will recover slightly more slowly for us is because we over index and travel leisure, areas like that, which we think will recover more slowly, travel won't come back quite as quickly as perhaps, people going to the office and being on-the-go. So lots of puts and takes in terms of what's going to happen by brand, by category by geography. And the biggest COVID impacts that we saw were clearly North America, Europe, very proud of what the team did in Europe in pivoting away from the Euro soccer championship and towards gaming, we do think that soccer will come -- we're hopeful that soccer will come back in some ways in 2021. So there's a lot in the guidance, but what we have really done is try COVID impacts in 2020, as we think about 2021, look at the 2019 base and put together winning plans, by category, by geography, by brand that gets us exactly to where we are today, when we talk about the 2021 guidance and rolls up into the net sales operating profit, EPS that we that we talked about. So I don't know Amit, if you want to add anything to that. No, we're going to be pretty flattish. So we've talked about brand building, being exactly where we think it needs to be overall. And we like where we are. We like the way we were positioned, as we said, in the last call, that we would keep our brand building pretty much at budget in 2020, which meant a big shift from the first half to the second half, for what are now obvious reasons. So we'll smooth that out in 2021. But we know we don't need a big resurgence, we like where we are in terms of investing in our brands. We'd like the way we're exiting this year, with the equity that we built in the brand and the money that we spent behind the brands. Now you look across our categories and what we've done, with all of our big brands, we feel very good about where we are. We were capacity constrained as we exited the year, nobody anticipated obviously, the type of year that cereal would have, no category grew nearly 9%, slowed down a little bit in the second half, but still five, six percentage growth. So we work very hard all year to keep up with demand and keep our service levels as high as we possibly could. And we ended the year with a flat share performance slipped a little in the fourth quarter, as you noted, almost all of that slippage was due to Frosted Flakes, where, because of capacity, we had to back away from promotions, you can see that in the syndicated data, down 20% in incremental sales, because we couldn't execute against the mission Tiger program and we wanted to keep our service levels, where retailers deserve them to be. So we didn't give up promotional slots. And nearly all of our share declined in the fourth quarter was due to Frosted Flakes. Now as we enter 2021, we continue to build against capacity, we continue to make good improvements. And we continue to be very optimistic as we go through the first half of this year, we're going to get better and better in terms of that capacity. And therefore, we'll get better and better in terms of our sheer performance. Yes. So Robert, as we looked at it, we aim to do better, right, but there's a lot of uncertainty. And recall, we returned to grow through a deploy for growth strategy. So it gets us back to where we said we would be and where we wanted to be based on our strategic planning stance. It could be better in retail, it could be better in certain categories, it could be slightly worse in a way from home depending on how that recovery happens. So we think it's a prudent planning stance but as we always say, we aim to do better and hopefully we will. Yes, Chris. So I'll start first, as we've said, in the past, our goal is to always gain share. And so we finished the year globally with holding or gaining share in over 80% of our category, country combinations, where there's measured data, so we feel good about that. In terms of the U.S., in particular, which you referenced, I did talk about the U.S. Rtech, where we held share for the full year, but we lost 50 basis points a share in the fourth quarter much of that due to capacity limitations that we had which I already mentioned. And so, our plan for 2021, we think in Rtech in ready to eat cereal is a winning plan. But if I look at some of the other categories for the full year and even the fourth quarter, if you look at the U.S. snacks business in and crackers, we gained share for the full year and we gained share in the fourth quarter. So we gained 50 basis points of cracker share in the fourth quarter in salty, which the category was explosive in the full year, gained about 12.5 of volume, we were up 11. So, based on our size, down ever so slightly but in the fourth quarter actually, we performed nearly 15% growth against the category of 10%. So we actually even did better in salty, our Pringles business. If I look at the portable wholesome snacks category, obviously a lot of on-the-go, so a category that was under pressure. For the full year and the fourth quarter, we had tremendous share performances. So we gained 250 basis points a share for the full year, 390 basis points in the fourth quarter, and that was great performance by Pop-Tarts, Rice Krispies treats, Nutri-Grain returned to growth in the fourth quarter. And then, if I look at Frozen, from the Griddle or Eggo business, obviously, terrific year, again, some capacity limitations for us but we gained 150 basis points of share in the fourth quarter, which was better than our -- is online with our full year performance. And then finally, on the vegan, which has got a lot of attention, because it's an explosive growth category. We were capacity constrained again there because nobody planned for the type of explosive growth. But we were up for the full year 24%, which wasn't enough to gain share, we lost, one basis point a share. But in the fourth quarter, we did better. We cut that share decline more than in half, we lost 40 basis points and we're up 20%. So that's a pretty good performance there. So in the categories where we didn't gain share, we were still growing double digits is another way to look at it. So that's why we like where our brand building is, we think it's been very, very productive. We measure every ROI by brand by category. And we think we entered 2021 with a lot of good momentum in our brands, in our categories and a good outlook for share performance in 2021. Yes, Michael, thanks. I'll start and turn it over to Amit as well. We've tried to be transparent as best as we possibly could, in an unprecedented environment, right. And so this guidance, I would say, is the best that we can do. And it's down the middle of the fairway. So, it could be better, it could have more challenges depending on how things recover and what happens in emerging markets. But we feel and don't -- we don't want to be falsely precise. And say, we know exactly what's going to happen in these uncertain times. But we want to maintain our transparency, we want to share with you what our planning stances are in terms of what we think will recover, how it will recover, and how our brands category, country combinations will perform. And again, we triangulate it, we look back at 2020 actual, what we had planned for 2020, pre-COVID, a 2019 base year ex the divestiture what our strategic planning intentions were and therefore what we wanted to accomplish in 2021 and what we thought we could accomplish in 2021. And those are the points that we landed on. And so again, trying to be transparent and trying to hit it down the middle of the fairway, I'd say is kind of the way I'd characterize the guidance. Amit, do you want to add any? We're catching up right now. So we're in good shape. The Incogmeato launch continues to go forward. We're adding chick flavors to that, we got some great innovations around chicken. And so we feel good about where the capacity is right now relative to the demand. Yes, thanks. I'll start and Amit has got definitely some things to add there. But I'd start by reminding you obviously, the divestiture, big divestiture. So when you look back and look at the numbers and say cash flow, or overall I think you said, absolute OP dollars, there's going to be a big difference because of that divestiture. And if I think about, where we finish the year, so organic net sales of plus 6%, Forex neutral adjusted OP of 3.5%, Forex adjusted EPS of 2.3% and a cash flow of 1.5 billion. That's a terrific year, I think under any set of circumstances and based on the guidance that we gave in 2021, to your question around cash, it's substantially better than the 2019 performance. And remember, there's some outflows of cash that happened whether it be incentives, whether it be other release of accruals that were accrued for in 2020. And the cash will actually outflow in 2021, which is why I think it's, again, useful to look at a two year comparison on everything, including the cash flow performance, which continues to get better. And so as we exit this year, that's why we're very confident that as a company from a top-line through a balanced bottom-line delivery standpoint, we are a much stronger company. And we come out of this pandemic and we enter 2021 in a much stronger position from a balance sheet perspective and from a top-line potential perspective as well. Amit, do you want to build on that? Yes. So Rob, I'd start by just reminding all of us that Incogmeato launched during the pandemic, so very difficult time to launch. But having said that, we're happy with where we are. And it also remind us that it is a sub-brand of MorningStar Farms. And MorningStar Farms finished the year with 25% consumption growth. So hardly a brand that's been disrupted but clearly a brand that is doing very, very well, despite some of the capacity constraints that I mentioned. Having said that, we did launch Incogmeato, we're up to about a 4 point share. When we look at our velocities relative to some of the smaller players, we're exceeding those velocities. When we look at the velocities compared to early MorningStar Farm launches at the same stage. We're ahead of those velocities as well. And as I said, we've got these chicken offerings, including Disney royalty chicken offerings that are coming to the fore right now. So we feel very good about where the whole MorningStar Farms performance is. And we continue to innovate around MorningStar Farms, but also Incogmeato, we're bullish about this and 25% consumption growth is pretty good."

            "content": "Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. In a year of unprecedented uncertainty, we consistently kept you apprised of our planning stance, raising our guidance twice during the year. And as shown on Slide number nine, we ultimately achieved or exceeded that guidance with the results we announced today. This improving outlook across the year reflected the impact of elevated at home consumption, of course, but it also reflected the strength of our underlying business and our return to balance growth. Let's first review our 2020 results, which are summarized on Slide number 10. As I mentioned, our results for the first quarter came in better than expected, organic net sales growth moderated to 2.5% in quarter four, slightly better than we had forecast and finished the year with 6% growth as guided. Currency neutral adjusted basis operating profit increased slightly year-on-year in the fourth quarter, which was better than we had forecast for a quarter with double-digit, brand building investment, incremental COVID costs and higher performance based compensation. We finished the year with currency neutral adjusted basis, operating profit growth of 3.5%, which is higher than our guidance and includes roughly 6% negative impact from the absence of businesses we divested in 2019. Currency neutral adjusted basis earnings per share declined year-on-year in quarter four owing to a higher tax rate and shares outstanding as well as absorbing $20 million of non-recurring costs related to our debt redemption we executed in December as part of our effort to deleverage our balance sheet. For the year, our earnings per share grew 2.5% which excludes roughly 5% negative impact from the absence of divested businesses. Finally, our cash flow of nearly $1.5 billion was much higher than projected, featuring higher earnings and a higher conversion of those net earnings. In all, a strong performance and the kind of balanced financial delivery we aimed for. Let's take a look at these metrics in more detail. We'll start with net sales growth on Slide number 11. On organic basis, net sales growth decelerated, as expected in quarter four, coming in at 2.5%. A few factors to point out, at home consumption growth rates around the world remain elevated, not decelerating as much as expected. Away from home declines remained in double digits, though not moderating as much as expected. We experienced adverse timing of shipments in certain categories in the U.S. relative to that sustained consumption growth and we experienced the business specific headwinds that we had anticipated, such as school closings in Northern Africa and October's civil unrest in Nigeria. Nevertheless, we saw organic growth in all four regions, again, in quarter four. Outside of organic basis growth, we saw adverse currency translation moderate from earlier in the year, reflecting the weakening of the U.S. dollar, since quarter three. And this year, our quarter four included an extra week, something we have every six fiscal year. For the full year, our organic net sales growth was 6%, featuring growth in both volume and price mix and with growth in all four regions and all four major category group, Snacks, Cereal, Frozen, and Noodles and other. A reasonable estimate for the net COVID impact, after its various puts and takes would suggest that it contributed about half of this organic net sales growth in 2020 putting our underlying growth at a very strong rate. Rounding out net sales growth for 2020, we roughly lost five percentage points from the absence of businesses, we had divested back in July 2019. Currency translation was offset by the impact of having the extra week in our fourth quarter. Now let's turn our discussion to profit margins with Slide number 12. As we've discussed, as we entered 2020, our goal was to stabilize gross profit margin, which would require offsetting a natural mix shift towards emerging markets, including our distributor business in Africa. We ended up doing better than that even as that mix shift continues. Specifically, our gross profit margin improved by 60 basis points year-on-year as operating leverage, revenue growth management and productivity initiatives more than offset the impact of more than $60 million of incremental direct COVID related costs. In the fourth quarter, gross margin leveled out because of shipment turning in the U.S. and some incremental costs, particularly in Latin America. But we are pleased with how we performed on this metric in 2020. Our operating profit margin also improved in 2020 but its quarter-by-quarter performance was greatly affected by the timing in our investment in advertising and consumer promotion. Recall that we postponed some advertising and a significant amount of consumer promotions during the first half. When sponsored events were canceled and the industry's focus was on getting food onto shelves. As you know, we decided to put that default spending to work in the second half, primarily in advertising, aimed at building brand equity and retaining household penetration. The result was double-digit increases year-on-year in A&P during quarter three and quarter four as increased advertising more than offset decreased consumer promotions. For total A&P, we finished 2020 right on our budget with a mid-single digit increase year-on-year. That brings us to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide number 13. Cash flow came in higher than anticipated throughout the year, a combination of our increased operating profits and reduced restructuring outlays along with good working capital management. The result was a significant improvement in our conversion ratio of net income into cash flow. As you know our priority for cash flow during 2019 and 2020, was to reduce our debt leverage after several years of acquisitions and restructuring outlays. This became all the more important as we entered an uncertain economic environment amidst the pandemic. Our stronger than expected cash flow allowed us to reduce debt faster than planned, right up to the $1.2 billion of debt we retired in December. This reduction in debt leverage gives us the financial flexibility to return more cash to share owners, as I'll discuss in just a moment. So let's now turn our attention to 2021 starting with Slide number 14. In forecasting our P&L for 2021, we ensured that we remained on track for steady balanced growth. Obviously, though, 2020 is an unusual base year to say the least. Not only did it have an extra shipping week in quarter four, but the pandemic created unusually high sales and operating leverage, especially in the first half and it also resulted in investment being shifted to the second half. Our stance was to plan for two year growth that keeps us on our strategic plan. Specifically, we planned around assumptions that result in two-year growth in organic net sales growth that is more than 2%; gross profit margin expansion on a two-year basis; and two-year growth in currency neutral operating profit of 3% to 4% excluding of divested businesses results from the 2019 base. Obviously, we've made planning assumptions around COVID, which are as follows. Underlying at home demand remains relatively elevated, but lapse unusual surges in quarter one and quarter two. Away from home demand remains depressed though moderating over the course of the year and emerging markets remaining growth though restrained by challenging macro conditions. But as you can see by the red bars on the slide, our underlying base business, excluding the divestiture COVID and the 53rd week, is expected to post another year of net sales and operating profit growth. And on a two-year basis, which effectively ignores the noise of 2020, we remain right on our strategic plan through 2021 and would call for similar balanced performance in 2022. Slide number 15 puts our 2021 guidance all together. Organic net sales are expected to be down about 1% year-on-year, reflecting the difficult comps in the first half. On a two-year compound annual growth though this translates to roughly 2.5% in line with a strategic plan I mentioned earlier. Adjusted operating profits on a currency neutral basis is projected to be down roughly 2% year-on-year, reflecting difficult comps in the first half related to last year's outsized operating leverage and delayed brand investment. On a two-year CAGR and excluding divested businesses from the 2019 base, this translates into roughly 3% to 4% growth in line with our strategic plan. Adjusted earnings per share on a currency neutral basis is expected to increase by approximately 1% year-on-year, aided by a decrease in interest expense caused by reduced debt and by lapping last year's debt redemption costs. On a two-year basis, excluding the impact of the divestiture from 2019 this implies about a 4% to 5% CAGR. Cash Flow is projected to be about $1.1 billion coming off 2020s exceptional $1.5 billion, but still significantly higher than 2019s cash flow of $600 million, which really was about 900 million when excluding the net of the divested businesses cash flow less the divestiture related tax and other outlays. This 2021 forecast is based on the earnings outlook and some timing of payments, such as performance based compensation accrued in 2020 but paid in 2021. Turning to Slide number 16, we entered 2021 in very solid financial condition. We had growth momentum across our region, as evidenced by consumption and share trends. We did not pull back on brand investment in 2020. So our brands are in good health. We benefited from strength and capabilities in digital data and analytics and ecommerce and we are well on our way to expanding capacity, where it's tight. We've improved our ability to convert income into cash flow and we deleveraged our balance sheet for increased financial flexibility. The combination of this improved business condition and enhanced financial flexibility enabled us to review share repurchases this year, after having refrained from them since quarter 1, 2019. In addition, we are increasing our quarterly dividend rate starting in quarter two. This means returning more cash to share owners and it reflects our confidence in the business. In summary, in 2020, we returned to balance growth between top-line margins, bottom-line and cash flow. We are confident that 2021 will be a continuation of this balanced growth, even if 2020s COVID impact and 53rd week create some noise on a one year basis. And with that, let me turn it back to Steve for a review of each of our major businesses. No. I think, like you said, Steve, our focus, at least from a planning stance was to look at it from a two year standpoint. And if you kind of look at the two year CAGRs, they are of off a growth standpoint, 2.5% on the top-line 3% to 4% on the bottom-line, and then on the EPS 4% to 5%. Okay. So let me start with the first question on commodities. I think we closed out 2020 with input cost inflation in the mid-single digits. And this was mostly offset by the productivity all the way through quarter four. I think we have seen green and energy markets rebound sharply in recent months, just on near term supply, demand and other factors. I think from our exchange traded commodity standpoint, we are well hedged through the first half of 2021 and roughly around 70% level of hedging coverage for the year. So I think, in terms of total inflation for 2021, we expect that to be higher than what we've experienced in 2020 but still in the mid-single digit rates. And I think we'd be looking to offset that with our usual productivity programs, with revenue growth management. And overall, as we've guided, we'd expect our gross margin to be up on a two-year basis, obviously, in this in 2020, our gross margin was up 60 basis points. And on a two-year basis, we'd still expect gross margins to be up and from a '21 standpoint, we'd be aiming for our gross margins to be stable. Steve, you want to talk two-year? No. I think Steve; you've covered it, on the clock. It's in line with our internal plans. And I talked about underlying at home demand remaining elevated. But no question, we will have to lap last year's surges, particularly in March. And it's interesting, as we've gone into further lockdowns, we haven't seen that panic buying that we saw in March. So that's something that we'll have to lap. On away from home, we've assumed that, it is moderate. But over the course of the year and sitting here today they still remain depressed. So that's the assumption. And then from emerging market standpoint, we had a relatively strong year in 2020. So we're continuing to plan on growth in emerging markets. But we've been cautious and prudent in terms of the macro conditions in emerging markets. So I think those are some of the assumptions and the way we've approached the guidance. Well, I think, from a two-year standpoint you're looking at organic growth, 2.5% on the top-line and then EPS growth at around 4% to 5%. And then the cash flow conversion, we've had an exceptional year of cash flow conversion in 2020, now to 100%. I think in 2021, there are some timing differences. So, some of the accruals will be paid out in 2021. But our conversion, even in 2021, we're targeting, in the mid 70s to 80% conversion. And then, if you adjust for the pension income that runs through our P&L, that's about 15% adjustment, it gets us to go high 90s. So, I think from an overall standpoint it's balanced. In 2020, we demonstrated, we delivered balanced delivery and certainly the guidance for 2021 calls for that for another year of that."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. Welcome to the Kellogg Company's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session with publishing analysts. Please note, this event is being recorded.  At this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for Kellogg Company. Mr. Renwick, you may begin your conference call.\nJohn Renwick: Thank you, Gary. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for a review of our third quarter results as well as updates regarding our outlook for full year 2020. I'm joined this morning by Steve Cahillane, our Chairman and CEO; and Amit Banati, our Chief Financial Officer. Slide 3 shows our forward-looking statements disclaimer. And as you are aware, certain statements made today such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to this third slide of the presentation as well as to our public SEC filings. This is of particular note during the current COVID-19 pandemic when the length and severity of the crisis and resultant economic and business impacts are so difficult to predict. A replay of today's conference call will be available by phone through Thursday, November 5. The call will also be available via webcast, which will be archived for at least 90 days on the Investor page of kelloggcompany.com. As always, when referring to our results and outlook, unless otherwise noted, we will be referring to them on a currency-neutral basis for net sales and on a currency-neutral adjusted basis for operating profit and earnings per share.  And now, I'll turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Cahillane: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I hope you are your families are holding up well in these turbulent times. Here at Kellogg, to get through these crises, we are executing well against our key priorities during the crisis. We have remain vigilant and active in keeping our employees safe, which remains job number one for us and our employees have handled this extremely well. We continue to supply the market place with our foods with no major supply disruptions and service levels gradually improving in the quarter. We continue to aid our communities with significant cash and food donations. Not to mention, the time our employees have generously volunteered to various initiatives and causes. And amidst very uncertain economies and financial markets, we have effectively preserved and improved our financial flexibility. These have been our priorities throughout the crisis, and we are executing very well against them. From the standpoint of financial results, we had another strong quarter with some highlights shown on slide number 6. First, our results came in stronger than we expected. We posted another quarter of strong organic net sales growth with a good balance between volume growth and price realization and with growth across all four regions and across all four major category groups, cereal, snacks, frozen and noodles. We expanded our gross profit margin as price, volume and productivity, more than offset sustained high levels of incremental COVID costs. And as we said we would, we shifted brand-building investment from the first half into the second half, resulting in a double-digit year-on-year increase in quarter three. We generated better-than-expected profit and earnings in the quarter, and particularly important, in an uncertain economy, we generated better cash flow than we anticipated, allowing us to further reduce our net debt. Second, our emerging markets continue to exceed our expectations, in spite of challenging COVID and economic conditions. We generated double-digit organic net sales growth in both Latin America and AMEA. Across all of our emerging markets, we collectively recorded double-digit organic net sales growth in cereal and noodles, and we grew snacks at a high single-digit rate, despite their on-the-go orientation, their reliance on traditional trade has been more disrupted by COVID and being a more discretionary purchase in difficult economic times. The strength of our portfolio, the diversification of our geographies and the experience of our management teams are clearly on display.  And third, we've continued to perform well in market. As expected, at-home consumption growth for packaged foods in general decelerated across the quarter, and our categories were no different. The good news is that, year-to-date, we have held or gained share in markets that represent almost three quarters of our annual net sales in measured markets. Most notable, in quarter three was the United States where we gained share in five of our six primary categories; in Europe, where we gained share in cereal across most of our major markets; and in AMEA, where we gained share of cereal in 11 of 13 major markets. Clearly, our brands and our brand building are resonating. And even in away-from-home channels, which remained soft during this pandemic, we gained share in most of our categories in the U.S. We also like how we're performing in e-commerce, an area in which we've invested in capabilities in recent years, and in which we continue to grow rapidly, outpacing our categories in key markets. So, we are winning in the marketplace and delivering better-than-expected financial results in the process. Turning to slide number 7. This sustained strong performance puts us in a good position to finish the year, not only with strong results and financial flexibility, but also with investment for the future.  Let's take each in turn. First, we're again raising our full year guidance, based on the strength of our better-than-expected third quarter results. As Amit will explain, we are raising our guidance for full year organic net sales growth, currency-neutral adjusted basis operating profit and earnings per share and cash flow. It's been a lot of work, but we're headed for a very strong year.  Second, we continue to invest for the future. Our brand building investment will be up double-digits again in quarter four, as we continue to reinvest funds that were delayed from the first half during the pandemic, on top of what had been planned for quarter four. Now is the time to communicate with consumers, who discovered our foods during the pandemic. Now is the time to emphasize new messaging around certain brands. Now is the time to further develop our master brand approach to advertising multiple brands in certain international markets. And now is the time to invest behind the launch of new brands like plant-based Incogmeato from MorningStar Farms in the U.S. and market expansion of brands like Cheez-It in Canada. On top of that, we're investing in capabilities such as in e-commerce, in packaging capabilities and in capacity. Simply put, we are taking actions now to emerge from this crisis a stronger company, and with increased confidence in our trajectory for consistent, balanced growth. We're seeking to retain incremental households. We're building on our strength in e-commerce, and we're ensuring that our emerging markets remain engines of growth for us. We're also strengthening our financial flexibility and delivering increased earnings this year for our share owners. So with that, let me turn it over to Amit, who will take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail.\nAmit Banati: Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Slide number 9 summarizes our results for the third quarter and first nine months. As Steve mentioned, our third quarter results came in better-than-anticipated, particularly on operating profit and cash flow. Net sales benefited from elevated at-home demand during the crisis, though this clearly moderated across countries and categories over the course of the quarter and was partially offset by continued softness in away-from-home channels. An important highlight of the quarter was the strength of our emerging markets, whose return to double-digit growth came despite very challenging conditions, including economic and COVID impacts on the traditional trade.  Operating profit increased on a reported basis because of a reduction in one-time charges. Now that recent years\u2019 substantial restructurings are largely behind us, it declined on an adjusted basis because of the absence of businesses divested last year, as well as higher expense for performance-based compensation and a significant planned increase in advertising and consumer promotion. Operating profit declined less than we expected in large part because of our positive performance in net sales and gross profit margin.  Earnings per share declined with operating profit along with an effective tax rate that was higher than last year as expected. And cash flow continue to come in better-than-planned, bringing our year-to-date cash flow above what had been our forecast for the full year, a reflection of our elevated earnings, reduced restructuring outlays, good working capital management and capital expenditure that has been delayed during the pandemic. Let's take a look at these metrics in more detail. We will start with net sales growth on slide number 10. While moderating from recent quarters, currency translation was a negative impact of about 1% in the quarter, largely due to Latin American currency's devaluation against the U.S. dollar. Last year's divestiture of our Keebler Cookies, pie crusts, ice cream cones and fruit snacks anniversaries at the time end of July. So, we had one month of impact in the quarter, pulling down net sales by just under 2 percentage points.  Organic net sales growth was 4.5% in the quarter. We had anticipated a meaningful deceleration from last quarter's 9% growth. And sure enough, we did indeed see a moderation in at-home consumption growth across our categories, and continued softness in away-from-home channels and on-the-go products.  Nevertheless, this quarter three organic growth performance was very promising. It was driven by organic growth across all four regions, and across all four global category groups. It also featured a better balance between volume and price mix, and it was supported by consumption growth and share gains in key categories and markets in turn buoyed by effective brand building activity.  Now, let's turn our discussion to profit margins with slide number 11. Going into the quarter, we had assumed that gross profit margin would contract a bit in quarter three, as we anticipated less net sales growth to cover sustained incremental COVID costs. However, our gross profit margin ended up expanding slightly as growth, productivity and price realization more than offset a resumed mix shift towards emerging markets, including Multipro, our distributor business in Nigeria. We expect to see gross profit margin to expand modestly again in quarter four, and therefore for the full year, despite sustained incremental COVID costs.  Another important impact on our operating profit margin was our increase in brand investment. Back in July, we discussed the postponement of advertising and consumer promotions during the height of the pandemic in the first half and our intention to reinvest those funds into brand building during quarter three and quarter four. The slide shows that delay in advertising and consumer promotion during quarter two, and how it was followed by a double-digit increase in quarter three, along with a similar double-digit increase planned for quarter four. This, along with an increase in expense for performance-based compensation, was the primary driver of our operating profit decline in quarter three, and will be again in quarter four.  Below operating profit, our interest expense remained below last year as expected. Other income, which is predominantly related to our pension plans, remained higher year-on-year also as expected, reflecting the impact of higher asset valuations at the beginning of the year. These favorable items were more than offset by the earnings per share, by a higher effective tax rate and an increase in average shares outstanding as we continue to refrain from share buybacks to prioritize financial flexibility during the current crisis.  That brings us to cash flow and capital structure on slide number 12. A lasting impact of this year will be the stronger than projected cash flow, enabling a faster than expected reduction in net debt. As shown on the top graph, our cash flow this year has significantly outpaced that of the past couple of years, even beyond lapping unusual outlays in each of the prior two year-to-date periods. As I mentioned, this is a result of higher than expected adjusted basis earnings this year, as well as the fact that we have gotten past the major restructurings and reorganizations of the last few years, which had required significant cash outlays but it also reflects our effective management of core working capital and the capital expenditure we've had to prioritize or delay during the pandemic so as to not impede capacity utilization in any way. This cash flow has enabled further increases in liquidity and further reductions in net debt as shown on the bottom chart. Strong liquidity and lower net debt against stronger cash flow give us enhanced financial flexibility. Let's now discuss our rest of year outlook starting with slide number 13 and our planning assumptions around the pandemic for the fourth quarter. While the direction of the pandemic remains uncertain, we are making certain planning assumptions. To that end, we assume that at-home demand growth will continue to decelerate, while sizable away-from-home sales declines moderate. These are simply continuations of trends we have seen in recent months. The reason we assume our away-from-home sales will take longer to stabilize is because of our weighting in segments like schools and travel and lodging, which are expected to take longer to recover. We also assume that growth in emerging markets will decelerate amidst COVID-related economic softness as well as some unusual market-specific factors in quarter four, such as school food programs being shut down in North Africa and the impact of new labeling regulations going into effect in Mexico. And finally, there is the investment that we delayed from the first half. Just as in quarter three, this first half funding will be implemented during quarter four on top of previously planned activity. The result should be another double-digit increase in advertising and consumer promotions in quarter four.  Slide number 14 shows what this all means for our full year outlook. As Steve mentioned, we are once again raising our guidance for the year. This time, to reflect our better-than-expected quarter three results, less any timing related factors from that quarter unless some incremental investments that we're adding to quarter four. Our full year guidance for organic net sales growth improves to just about 6% from our previous guidance of around 5%. This reflects our better-than-expected 4.5% growth in quarter three and a modest increase to our outlook for quarter four, though the latter still assumes a deceleration for the reasons we just discussed. Our full year guidance for currency-neutral adjusted basis operating profit improves to growth of approximately 2% from our previous guidance for a decline of about 1%. This positive swing reflects our better-than-forecast operating profit in quarter three with some timing-related shifts in costs into quarter four, along with the incremental advertising and promotion and other costs and investments I just described. This drives a similar increase in our full year guidance for currency-neutral adjusted basis, earnings per share, which goes to growth of approximately 2% from previous guidance for a decline of about 1%. Our guidance for cash flow increases to $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, a substantial improvement from our previous guidance of approximately $1 billion. This reflects our stronger-than-expected delivery in quarter three, let some elements that are likely timing-related, such as capital expenditure delayed from earlier this year. Putting it all together, we're in position to finish 2020 with a strong financial performance, featuring a good balance of growth, profitability, investment and cash generation, and we will enter 2021 in a very solid financial condition. And with that, let me turn it back to Steve for a review of each of our major businesses.\nSteve Cahillane : Thanks, Amit. Let's begin with North America on slide number 16. As we had expected and as you've seen in the scanner data, at-home consumption growth decelerated throughout the third quarter, while away-from-home channels saw some moderation in their steep declines. The result for our North America region was just under 3% organic net sales growth in quarter three. Note, while we experienced a continued though moderating double-digit decline in away-from-home sales as expected, the rest of North America business turned in a solid mid-single-digit growth performance. And while our deceleration from quarter two surge was inevitable, we're very pleased with how we performed within our primary categories. . In Canada, we grew consumption in all 6 of our primary categories, including gaining significant share and distribution in crackers with Cheez-It. In the U.S., we held our gain share in 5 of our 6 primary categories at retail as well as in the vast majority of our categories in measured away-from-home channels. We'll visit these key U.S. categories in more detail in a moment, but this end market performance is a key reason we're confident that we are strengthening our business amidst this crisis. Household penetration and buy rates have increased across our categories since the pandemic began, and we are focused on retaining as many of these consumers and occasions as we can. This relies on effective marketing and sales execution, of course, but it is also dependent on our supply chain to get food to the marketplace. Our plants are running well, still focused on throughput and still up against capacity in certain categories in food forms requiring tremendous agility. Our supply chain clearly has risen to the challenge. Operating profit decreased as planned in quarter three as brand investment was shifted out of the first half and into the second half and as we had less incremental sales to cover sustained levels of incremental COVID costs. But North America is on track for a very good year of net sales and operating profit growth. Let's take a quick look at each of our 3 major category groupings in North America, starting with our largest snacks on slide number 17. North America snacks continued to post strong growth, even if at-home demand decelerated from quarter two's highs and away-from-home channels and on-the-go pack formats remained in decline. In the U.S., Pringles continued to post double-digit consumption growth, holding share despite continued softness in on-the-go pack formats as expected. In crackers, we continue to outpace the category's solid mid-single-digit growth in the quarter. Cheez-It Snap'd continues to grow strongly in its second year, supported by recently added capacity while accompaniment oriented cracker brands, Club, Townhouse and Carr\u2019s have collectively gained share as well. In portable wholesome snacks, the category remains pressured by reduced on-the-go occasions during the pandemic. And while this has impacted on-the-go brands in our portfolio like RX and Kashi, we've been able to gain share on the strength of our growing Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies treats brands. So our snack brands business is in great shape. Now let's turn to North America cereal on slide number 18. Our North America cereal net sales grew again in quarter three, though reflecting a deceleration in the category in retail channels and continued declines in away-from-home channels. But what is so encouraging is what we're doing within the category. In U.S. measured retail channels, we again outpaced the category. And we did it on the strength of renewed advertising support and refreshed messaging for brands like Special K and Mini-Wheats and on innovation like JUMBO SNAX and MASHUPS that have helped us lead the category in share of innovation this year. We have added more household penetration during the pandemic, and we've held on to more of it than the category. And the same goes for buy rates. Our enhanced data and analytics give us the ability to target the right consumer and occasion with the right messaging for that consumer and occasion, and we're seeing the results. So we're executing well in North America cereal. We're also executing well in North America frozen foods, shown on slide number 19. Our North America frozen foods categories didn't decelerate as much as cereal and snacks during quarter three. And as a result, we continue to deliver high single-digit organic net sales growth. And that is despite capacity constraints and declines in away-from-home channels as well as the phasing out of certain non-core product lines. Our core businesses are performing very well. In U.S. retail channels, our Eggo brand grew consumption by almost 13% in the quarter, with strong growth in waffles, French toast and pancakes and continuing to gain share. Our MorningStar Farms brand grew consumption by nearly 18%, trailing the frozen veg vegan category's exceptional growth as we ramp up against our capacity. MorningStar Farms meat alternative sub-brand Incogmeato was launched during the quarter. It's early days, and we're still building up our distribution, but we have launched burgers, sausage bratwurst and ground beef into the refrigerated aisle. And into the frozen aisle, we've launched Disney-shaped chicken nuggets, the first kid-oriented offering in this plant-based category. We are expecting a gradual distribution build, and we're confident about our food, branding and breadth of offerings. So like our other North American businesses, frozen foods is performing very well. As we look to the remainder of the year for Kellogg North America, we expect the deceleration in at-home demand growth that we discussed earlier. We're focused on restoring service levels, particularly in capacity type brands and categories, and we'll continue to reinvest the funds we deferred from the first half. We have no doubt we will emerge from 2020 with a stronger North America business. Now let's discuss our international businesses, starting with Europe on slide number 20. Kellogg Europe posted its 12th consecutive quarter of organic net sales growth in quarter three. Growth decelerated as expected as the COVID-led surge in at-home cereal demand moderated, while declines persisted in away-from-home channels. In cereal, our net sales increased at a low single-digit rate in the quarter. Category growth rates finished the quarter in roughly that range, and we added to our year-to-date share gains in key markets across the region. In snacks, our net sales were down very slightly in the quarter. Pringles growth improved from last quarter, led by accelerated consumption and share growth in the UK. Even amidst altered commercial plans because of COVID, we've gained share this year in our 3 biggest markets in the region: the UK, Germany and Russia. Meanwhile, portable wholesome snacks continued to feel the impact of fewer on-the-go occasions during the quarter as expected, though its declines moderated from the previous quarter. Overall, in emerging markets, namely Russia and Central Europe, we experienced a decline in net sales reflecting challenging economic conditions, particularly in snacks. The good news is that cereal remained in solid growth, and Pringles has gained share. As in our other regions, Europe reinvested a good portion of brand building that had been delayed from the first half. This is important for solidifying our competitive positions, and we'll see this again in quarter four. So we really like how we've been executing in Kellogg Europe. Let's turn to the Kellogg Latin America on slide number 21. Given the challenging macro conditions in this region, we had expected decelerating net sales growth. Instead, Kellogg Latin America posted double-digit organic growth, and this double-digit growth was broad-based across all 4 sub-regions: Mexico, Brazil, Pacific, and Caribbean and Central America. The growth was again led by double-digit organic net sales growth in cereal, whose consumption growth remained elevated in modern trade channels even if we did see category growth rates decelerate during the quarter. Snacks, which has been negatively impacted by the pandemic lockdown and recessionary environment, bounced back in quarter three with low single-digit organic net sales growth. Leading this growth was our business in Brazil, where local production and a new strategic distribution partner are benefiting Pringles, and we continue to gain share in cookies. Higher net sales more than offset adverse transactional foreign exchange and COVID-related costs, not to mention a significant double-digit increase in brand building. Profit growth also continued to lap last year's costly distributor transitions as well as start-up of local production in Brazil. So we're performing well in spite of tough conditions. We expect decelerating at-home demand to slower cereal sales in quarter four, and we faced some uncertainty in Mexico regarding new labeling regulations, which we've mentioned previously, and we'll see another quarter of increased brand building. Nevertheless, we're clearly executing well in Latin America in a difficult macroeconomic environment while also reinvesting for the future. And finally, we'll discuss AMEA, shown on slide number 22. Like Latin America, AMEA turned in better-than-expected double-digit organic net sales growth. Growth was broad-based across Australia, Asia, Africa and the Middle East and across cereal, snacks, noodles and other. As you can see on the chart, cereal demand remained elevated in many markets. The result was high single-digit organic net sales for cereal in the region but just as important have been the share gains we realized in key markets like Australia, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and South Africa.  In snacks, double-digit organic net sales growth was led by Pringles, which returned to growth momentum as we restored supply. Category growth rates have moderated, but we gained share in Australia and key markets in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. In noodles and other products, double-digit organic growth in net sales reflected expansion of our Kellogg noodles in the Middle East and South Africa as well as a strong sequential acceleration in growth for Multipro, the distributor portion of our business in West Africa. This business showed great resilience in a difficult environment in quarter three. Like our other regions, AMEA increased its brand building at a double-digit rate in the quarter, reflecting investment that we shifted from the first half, but the same sales growth and operating leverage was enough to more than offset this investment. We do expect slower growth in AMEA in quarter four, reflecting not only the deceleration we've been seeing in cereal categories throughout the region. But also the impact of COVID-related school closings, which affect important school programs we supply in North Africa. And it will be tested further by protests currently disrupting business in Nigeria. But there's no question, we are executing well in AMEA, managing through some challenging macro conditions while continuing to invest for the long-term. Let's wrap up with a brief summary on slide number 24. First of all, I'm incredibly proud of the way our organization has rallied to execute well through unprecedented and challenging conditions. Everything starts with protecting our people, and we are indeed keeping each other safe. We're also doing a good job supplying the marketplace, and we're supporting our communities. We're preserving and enhancing our financial flexibility. To do all this in a time of turmoil and uncertainty is a testament to the character of this organization. Second, we're pleased with our end market performance. Even having to replan our commercial calendar, we're executing well in the marketplace. We've expanded household penetration. We're growing across retail channels, notably in e-commerce, and we're finding ways to adjust to difficult conditions in away-from-home channels. Importantly, we're holding or gaining share in most of our markets, notably in the U.S., where we held or gained share in the majority of our retail categories and our categories in away-from-home channels. This reflects how we are competing. Third, we're pleased by our performance in emerging markets. In spite of challenging conditions, we've continued to grow in these markets with much less slowdown than we anticipated. This is a credit to our experienced management teams, our diversified geographic footprint, our local supply chains and the strength and breadth of our portfolio. And fourth, we're happy to be over-delivering our financial plan this year. We are again raising our full year guidance for net sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow, which has us getting ahead of our plans for enhancing financial flexibility. And we're doing this without cutting back on reinvestment in brands and capabilities. In fact, we've stepped up our investment, which will help us long into the future. In summary, we are confident that we will emerge from this crisis an even stronger company. We've reached new households and supported our most powerful brands. We've enhanced capabilities such as data and analytics, e-commerce and revenue growth management. We've strengthened our supply chain, and we've optimized SKUs. And we've strengthened our portfolio and operations in emerging markets. Our goal is sustained balance between top-line and cash flow growth, and we are on firmer footing now more than ever. And with that, we'll open it up for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nNik Modi : Steve, I was hoping maybe you can help us get a little more granularity on what you're exactly doing in terms of this customer retention. Obviously, every company is talking about, hey, we've recruited all these consumers, and we're spending behind it. But can you just talk about specifically what you're doing because it seems like this is going to go on for at least another 6 months, if not longer? And so it seems like you have a good window here to really influence consumer behavior. So any thoughts on that would be really helpful.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. Thanks for the question, Nik. First of all, you can see what we've done in terms of our marketing and brand building investments. So we're concentrating that in the back half of the year as we said we would. So we've got lots of funds directed exactly at that. The second thing is we have really enhanced our data and analytics. So we have a better understanding now more than ever about consumers and occasions at a very granular level. So the messaging that we're getting out there, digital, social and otherwise is directed in a more micro way against consumers and occasions that drive the type of behaviors that we want. And we're seeing real results. So if I gave you just a couple of examples. In terms of penetration, the RTEC category is growing penetration, not quite at 1%. And we're more than double that at nearly 2% RTEC penetration, and we're also retaining those households. Same thing in salty snacks. So it's really about understanding the consumer, the consumer occasion, what drives behavior in getting that message out there. And we've got a lot of investment behind that. So more to go. We're pleased with where we are, but it's really based on the fundamental improvements in data and analytics and our ability to micro target against those consumers supplemented with the right level of investment behind it.\nOperator: The next question is from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSteve Powers : So I wanted to talk about the strong emerging market performance, which was clearly a call out in the quarter. I guess, can you talk just a bit more around how much of that you think was isolated to the quarter versus something that's more structural that you can build upon in the future? I know you called out some specific headwinds in the fourth quarter in North Africa and Mexico. Maybe you can quantify those. But I'm really asking the question more in terms of the medium-term on a normalized basis. \nSteve Cahillane: Yes, Steve. We were very pleased with the performance in emerging markets in this quarter, obviously. It was led by cereal, which saw elevated demand based on some of the lockdowns. We continue to expand our noodles business very successfully. So we're pleased about that. But in quarter four, obviously, we see the potential for some slowdowns, which is what we talked about. We've got unusual situations, the school closings in North Africa. That's a big bit of business for us. The labeling regulations in Mexico, uncertain how -- if and how that will impact the business. It's across really all consumer packages. So hard to say. And then Nigeria, obviously, in the news very much, as you can see with protests and disruption which disrupts our business, has disrupted our business there. So always watch outs in emerging markets to be sure and when you have this type of environment, coupled with the recessionary environment, you always want to stay close and watch it. But very proud of the way the organization in quarter three came through in emerging markets and delivered a better-than-expected performance.\nOperator: The next question is from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.\nKen Zaslow : You made a comment, and I always like to hear this comment, is you're going to emerge stronger out of the COVID-19 experience. Can you talk about how that would affect your financial outlook in terms of what that really means in terms of qualitative and as well as quantitative outlook of what you think -- what does it mean to emerge stronger? Does it mean a higher growth rate? Does it mean higher margins? Does it just mean more spending? How do you frame that? And just to put context on that, that would be very helpful. .\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. So thanks for the question, Ken. Obviously, we're not going to get into any 2021 guidance at this stage. We're still working through our plans. But when we talked about emerging as a stronger company, we're making lasting impact to the business. You see that in the financial flexibility, the type of cash we've been able to generate. You see that especially in the investment in the brands and capabilities that we're putting into the marketplace to drive penetration, to drive retention, to keep those households. You see that in our digital and e-commerce capability that we're continuing to invest in. And then our supply chain, as I said, very proud of our supply chain in the way they've been able to be agile and meet this unheard of kind of surge in demand and this lengthy -- the length at which it's occurred. And so we're investing in capability and capacity in the longer-term in our supply chain as well, which we mentioned. So all of those things give us very good confidence that we are emerging stronger. And when we get to February, we'll talk about it in more detail what that looks like. Amit, do you want to add anything?\nAmit Banati : And I think just to add to that, I think you look at the strength of our cash flow, I think that's allowed -- we always said that our priority this year would be to reduce our net debt, and I think the strength of our cash flow is allowing us to accelerate that net debt reduction. And so I think that allows us much more financial flexibility as we emerge out of this crisis.\nKen Zaslow: Okay. And just to be clear, I wasn't looking for next year's guidance. I was kind of thinking more about like bigger picture, longer-term guidance, your growth algorithm or anything like that, that would be quantitatively different. That was kind of what I was looking for. I wasn't trying to get that next year's number. Just any other bigger picture financial outlook. It seems like the reduction of debt, but is there more spending that goes into data analytics? Is there anything else that -- and then I'll leave it there, and I appreciate it.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. No, I think I just -- exactly, it's confidence in the trajectory based on the investments that we just talked about. And it's -- as you know, Ken, there's so much uncertainty right now. How long this goes, what consumer behavior really changes and how it lasts. And so we're leaning into it. We're very much leaning into it, but we believe that this crisis is terrible as it's been, has given us an opportunity to really engage with consumers in meaningful and lasting ways and to make those investments to emerge stronger. \nOperator: The next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nKen Goldman : Your guidance assumes that at-home demand continues to decelerate. Doug McMillon though that this week he is seeing consumer stock up behavior actually rising in certain areas. Are you -- I guess, I'm curious, are you seeing any indication that your larger customers are preparing for a wave 2 of pantry loading? Or is this really not anything you're anticipating at this time?\nSteve Cahillane : Yes. Thanks, Ken. Again, there's so many things that are unknowable right now. And so it's really our planning assumptions. And to the best of our ability, what we're thinking of is the away-from-home channels, as we talked about, not really recovering very quickly. We're weighted towards schools and travel and leisure. So the ones that are recovering, convenience and so forth. Your QSR, you're starting to see stabilize, but not where we're weighted. And then in terms of retail channels, we were talking about in the third quarter about a deceleration. It did decelerate. It continues to decelerate. At what level it stops and starts to go back up again? Is an unknowable. We see the same news reports. We obviously see the same terrible trends in the COVID virus. And so this is our planning assumption, and we hope for a recovery, obviously, as everybody does in terms of these lockdowns and so forth. But to the best of our ability, this is what we see. And at a point in time, you just have to make a call and say, the continuation of the deceleration is what we see. But you have to be agile, just in case that changes.\nOperator: The next question is from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane : Steve, I wanted to ask about Incogmeato. It's -- we've noticed -- seen the advertising presence as you've launched the product. And so I guess a couple of questions. One, just as you look at the strategy tactically as you\u2019ve launched the product, do you think there's an opportunity there in terms of just having a better specialty traditional media presence versus the existing kind of established brands? And then second, if you can talk a little bit about shelf space and just how far along you are in terms of distribution? And then finally, just you touched on capacity constraints. So just what the plans are there to expand capacity as you build out distribution?\nSteve Cahillane : Yes, thanks, Bryan. So the first thing I'd say is, it's early days, obviously. And we're all learning what it means to launch a new brand in a pandemic environment where shoppers' behaviors are different, right? And so we've talked about how big brands are resonating. People trust big brands. They get in and out. The shopping experience as quickly as they can. And so we do believe that launching Incogmeato under the halo of the MorningStar Farms brand gives it a real advantage. And when you look at MorningStar Farms, up I think it's 27% year-to-date through quarter three, obviously really strong growth and again launching Incogmeato underneath that. And it was really scheduled for a March 31 launch. We had to delay that based on retailer resets. We have got our burger, our ground bratwurst and sausage products off. We're launching our Disney chicken nuggets. We're very strong in chicken and obviously the Disney franchise, and this is a Mickey offering. We think we'll get a lot of traction. And so the national distribution is really just building as we speak, but we're pleased with where we are. We're pleased with the early returns, but it is very early. So everything that we talked about in terms of the strategy, we think holds true, particularly the strength of the product offering itself and the strength of launching under the MorningStar Farms halo, we believe still remain very relevant. But we're vigilant. We've got our sales organization out there each and every day, checking on placements, and doing everything they can to advance the visibility of Incogmeato in the marketplace.\nBryan Spillane : And then just capacity?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. So capacity, we ran up against capacity. Nobody planned for 27% growth, obviously, but we've got -- in the short-term really working on crewing and getting everything we can in terms of throughput. And as we enter 2021, we do have plans for additional lines and so more significant capacity coming on. So in short-term, it's about crewing and throughput. In the longer-term or the medium term, which is really next year, it's about additional lines to really add to capacity, because we see this as a lasting. You're not going to see this type of elevated demand, I would suspect, going forward. But plant-based is a real megatrend. It was before the pandemic, and the type of trial that you're seeing is really going to we think accelerate what was already a meaningful trend in this space.\nOperator: Next question is from Eric Larson with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.\nEric Larson : Thanks for the question, everyone, and hope all is well. I just want to drill down a little bit more on your cash flow. That's sort of the important metric that I'm focused on. And so it looks like you may be deferred a piece of your capital expenditures, which will obviously come back next year. And I'm curious also if you're running your plants yet to just meet demand or if you now have enough capacity to kind of rebuild some inventory here. So in that difference in your guidance of $1 billion to $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, how much of that goes away with increased CapEx next year and maybe some working capital rebuild? So what is sort of the net cash flow improvement that we can look for?\nAmit Banati : Yes. So I think just on the cash flow, right, there are a number of factors that are driving our improved cash flow, right? So part of it is driven by just higher earnings -- higher adjusted earnings, a significant reduction in restructuring, outlays, good working capital management that we've seen across all our businesses, and then the capital expenditure. Some of which has been delayed. Now we are hoping to catch up on capital expenditure in quarter four. And that has been reflected in our outlook, with planned downtime to get some of the CapEx away, and some of it will be delayed. But I think, as Steve mentioned, right, from a CapEx standpoint, I think our focus is on getting the capacity in all our constrained platforms as quickly as possible. So I would say part of it -- part of the cash flow is timing and phasing. But equally, a part of it is as well just sustained improvement in our earnings, in our reduction in restructuring as well as working capital, which we would expect to sustain.\nEric Larson : Yes. Just -- so to finish up on the -- one part of the question. This will be -- I'll be done with this after this. So are you able to run your plants today to help build some of your inventory and maybe some at retail too? We know those inventories are depleted. Or are you still just running to kind of meet current demand? \nAmit Banati: I think it depends on the platform. And I think it depends -- so in some platforms, we're running flat out to service the elevated demand. In others where we can, we're taking the opportunity to catch up on capital expenditure. So I think it varies across the platforms. \nOperator: The next question is from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lavery : I just want to actually go back to MorningStar Farms. Clearly, got the outstanding growth and stands out against your other categories. How do you think about the opportunity outside the U.S.? We've seen competitors make a push there. Certainly, there's some scale that's not the same as you have in the U.S., but what are your ambitions to launch internationally? \nSteve Cahillane : Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael. What I'd say is, right now the priority is the United States. It's a huge opportunity. MorningStar Farms is a very big brand. So clearly, winning in the U.S. is -- and competing in the U.S. is the number 1 priority for us. We are, outside the U.S., in Australia, New Zealand, currently. And so we are experimenting, and we'll see what the opportunity is and how it presents itself. But we believe that priority 1 is the United States because of the size of the market and because of the advantage we have having MorningStar Farms as a very established brand. \nOperator: The next question is from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDavid Palmer : Steve, you mentioned investing for future in your summary slide. And certainly, that's not new to Kellogg this year. It seems 3-plus years you've been doing a lot of heavy lifting in your business, particularly in the U.S., with the rolling thunder of investments in snacks and cereal and frozen this year. And it seems like you've done some good repositioning that in addition to COVID-related demand, maybe creating additional room to invest or reinvest. So I'm wondering how you're thinking longer-term about the need to reinvest versus the investment rates that you've been doing in recent years? And what are you reviewing as you get through COVID to assess that need to reinvest?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes, thanks, David. So we have put money behind our brands. We\u2019ve put investment behind our brands. And we've seen the benefits of that flowing through. And we are singularly focused on balanced growth. So we're pleased with the top-line performance pre-COVID and obviously we get the bump from COVID. And when you look at the financial results of this year, based on the new guidance that we just updated today, you see a P&L that looks very solid and very balanced with good top-line growth, margins improving and a nice bottom-line performance. And so we also like the type of investment that we have currently behind our brands, when you think about it as a percentage of net sales, for example. And so as we think forward, we like where we are in terms of our brand-building spend, and we would see that continuing. So we don't see any great need for a big insurgent into any particular area. We benefited from being able to invest this year. In particular when you think about the level of investment in the second half of the year because of the COVID crisis, we had this concentration of lots of consumer messaging going into the back half of this year, into the fourth quarter, we believe will allow us to enter 2021 with lots of good momentum and lots of brand building and equity that's been invested into our brands. And so we like where we stand today in terms of the health of our brands and the momentum of our brands.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nChris Growe : I just had a question for you in relation to the progress you've made towards that $60 million spending that you talked about from the first half shortfall. I know you're double-digit this quarter and expect to be in the fourth quarter as well. Can you say how much of that you got done in the third quarter? And I'm curious if that -- maybe not so much of that figure, but if your rate of spending overall has changed, has it gone up at all by chance, just given the rate of elevated demand and the returns you're seeing from that investment? \nSteve Cahillane : Yes, thanks, Chris. So roughly speaking, we got about a third of it off in the third quarter. And so we're obviously planning on two-thirds of it off in the fourth quarter, which leads to double-digit brand building against various platforms. That's on top of what we had already planned. And so that's what I was just saying in the previous question. That's why we've got this concentration of really good brand messaging happening in the back half of the year and with good ROIs. And so we're very pleased with the type of performance we're getting from it. But remember, too, that these are -- a lot of this is to build the longer-term equity of our brands and enter 2021 with good momentum.  Now having said all that, there's all this uncertainty, right? And so what happens with everything from movie releases to college football bowls in the fourth quarter remains an uncertainty. So we'll continue to have to be agile in how we think about where the right places to invest are, but we're determined to invest against our brands to continue to build the equity, to drive the right ROIs and to enter 2021 with real solid momentum.\nOperator: The next question is from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nRobert Moskow : Steve or Amit, I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what total advertising will be for the year. Is it going to be up a lot? Or -- because you're giving first half, second half kind of information, but it's hard for us to put in context for the whole year. And also, when you look at the 10-K, your advertising was down 10% last year. So as a percentage of sales basis, can you give us some color on what you think the right level is?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes, thanks, Rob. So for the full year, we'll be up mid-single digits ex the divestiture, right? And we'll be up, as I just mentioned, double-digits in the second half of the year. And so that's why I talk about 2021 entering with real momentum. And we believe that, that gives us the right level from a percentage of sales, roughly speaking, of where we want to be. Now we always reserve the right with great ROIs and great ideas to go plus or minus. But when you look at the momentum that we've got in our net sales pre-COVID and what we built last year, we felt like we were getting significantly good returns on our advertising spend last year. And if you'll recall, we exited fourth quarter with 2.7% growth, and that was pre-COVID. So we were clearly getting the benefit of the type of investments that we were making over the course of the last 3 years, really. And so -- and they came with some surges and some tactical movements around. But if you just go back to the top-line and see the top-line momentum that was building over the course of last year, we feel like we were deploying that advertising spending in very good ways, with good returns that were getting us exactly what we wanted. And obviously, this year, everything went completely into replanning after COVID. But again, we'll finish the year with mid-single-digit advertising spend ex-divestiture with real momentum in the back half of the year because of the concentration and double-digit nature of the investment in quarter three and quarter four.\nRobert Moskow : And just a follow-up. Is mid-single-digit pretty much what you were expecting to do? Or did you increase it beyond? Because you've made a lot of comments here about now is the time. So is this an increase versus the original plan?\nSteve Cahillane: It's a slight increase, Rob, to the original plan, but pretty close. And so if you recall last quarter, on our earnings, I talked about how we were bound and determined to spend what we had planned on spending, and that gives us the type of concentration in the second half and the momentum. So up slightly from even that, but just slightly. But you can think about it kind of in terms of spending our full year allocated budget against our brands. \nOperator: The next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJason English: Just a couple of quick questions for me. First, the -- we've obviously seen cereal sales decelerate from where they were last quarter, but a sub-1% growth figure from you this quarter did surprise me. Is that reflective of maybe some inventory that had to come down after you restock last quarter? Or is it foodservice now or the education facilities becoming a bigger part of the business? What exactly is driving that weakness?\nSteve Cahillane : Yes, Jason. It really -- you didn\u2019t point to the double-digit declines in away-from-home channels, and that's a sizable portion of our business as well as the on-the-go pack formats. If you take away those declines in away-from-home in particular, the rest of the business was up mid-single digits, right? And if you look at our consumption, you can see that as well, up mid-single-digits. So it really is the away-from-home channels that drove that. \nJason English : And is away-from-home a bigger piece of the business as we get into the school year? \nSteve Cahillane : Yes. The answer to that is yes. And now there's a great deal of uncertainty, obviously, with what really happens with schools. And we all see that in our daily lives. Schools going back and then going into hybrid and then getting shut down. And so it's a very fluid situation. But from a consumption standpoint, we still see the elevated demand, and we still see the benefits of COVID, but it is definitely counterbalanced by the away-from-home softness. \nJason English : Sure. My next question is on trade spend. It's -- a lots of other folks in the industry are seeing really good price realization right now because promotional levels are still subdued. The Nielsen data certainly suggests promotion levels are equally subdued for you, but we're not seeing the same type of price benefit. Why is that? Is your trade spend not coming down? And if it's not coming down, if it's staying where it is, where is the money going if it's not funding promotions?\nAmit Banati : So Jason, we don't -- we won't get into the specifics of trade. But I think from an overall standpoint, we're seeing the price mix come through. I think within that, there is a very marked category shift. I think we talked that in our last call, just the mix between cereal and snacks and different rates there -- different rates between the channels. I think that's probably driving some of the negatives. But overall, we're seeing price mix come through. .\nSteve Cahillane : Operator, we are at 10:30. So we're going to have to wrap it up. \nOperator: Okay. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to John Renwick for any closing remarks.\nJohn Renwick: Thanks everyone for your interest. And if you have follow-up questions, please do not hesitate to call us.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve Cahillane",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I hope you are your families are holding up well in these turbulent times. Here at Kellogg, to get through these crises, we are executing well against our key priorities during the crisis. We have remain vigilant and active in keeping our employees safe, which remains job number one for us and our employees have handled this extremely well. We continue to supply the market place with our foods with no major supply disruptions and service levels gradually improving in the quarter. We continue to aid our communities with significant cash and food donations. Not to mention, the time our employees have generously volunteered to various initiatives and causes. And amidst very uncertain economies and financial markets, we have effectively preserved and improved our financial flexibility. These have been our priorities throughout the crisis, and we are executing very well against them. From the standpoint of financial results, we had another strong quarter with some highlights shown on slide number 6. First, our results came in stronger than we expected. We posted another quarter of strong organic net sales growth with a good balance between volume growth and price realization and with growth across all four regions and across all four major category groups, cereal, snacks, frozen and noodles. We expanded our gross profit margin as price, volume and productivity, more than offset sustained high levels of incremental COVID costs. And as we said we would, we shifted brand-building investment from the first half into the second half, resulting in a double-digit year-on-year increase in quarter three. We generated better-than-expected profit and earnings in the quarter, and particularly important, in an uncertain economy, we generated better cash flow than we anticipated, allowing us to further reduce our net debt. Second, our emerging markets continue to exceed our expectations, in spite of challenging COVID and economic conditions. We generated double-digit organic net sales growth in both Latin America and AMEA. Across all of our emerging markets, we collectively recorded double-digit organic net sales growth in cereal and noodles, and we grew snacks at a high single-digit rate, despite their on-the-go orientation, their reliance on traditional trade has been more disrupted by COVID and being a more discretionary purchase in difficult economic times. The strength of our portfolio, the diversification of our geographies and the experience of our management teams are clearly on display.  And third, we've continued to perform well in market. As expected, at-home consumption growth for packaged foods in general decelerated across the quarter, and our categories were no different. The good news is that, year-to-date, we have held or gained share in markets that represent almost three quarters of our annual net sales in measured markets. Most notable, in quarter three was the United States where we gained share in five of our six primary categories; in Europe, where we gained share in cereal across most of our major markets; and in AMEA, where we gained share of cereal in 11 of 13 major markets. Clearly, our brands and our brand building are resonating. And even in away-from-home channels, which remained soft during this pandemic, we gained share in most of our categories in the U.S. We also like how we're performing in e-commerce, an area in which we've invested in capabilities in recent years, and in which we continue to grow rapidly, outpacing our categories in key markets. So, we are winning in the marketplace and delivering better-than-expected financial results in the process. Turning to slide number 7. This sustained strong performance puts us in a good position to finish the year, not only with strong results and financial flexibility, but also with investment for the future.  Let's take each in turn. First, we're again raising our full year guidance, based on the strength of our better-than-expected third quarter results. As Amit will explain, we are raising our guidance for full year organic net sales growth, currency-neutral adjusted basis operating profit and earnings per share and cash flow. It's been a lot of work, but we're headed for a very strong year.  Second, we continue to invest for the future. Our brand building investment will be up double-digits again in quarter four, as we continue to reinvest funds that were delayed from the first half during the pandemic, on top of what had been planned for quarter four. Now is the time to communicate with consumers, who discovered our foods during the pandemic. Now is the time to emphasize new messaging around certain brands. Now is the time to further develop our master brand approach to advertising multiple brands in certain international markets. And now is the time to invest behind the launch of new brands like plant-based Incogmeato from MorningStar Farms in the U.S. and market expansion of brands like Cheez-It in Canada. On top of that, we're investing in capabilities such as in e-commerce, in packaging capabilities and in capacity. Simply put, we are taking actions now to emerge from this crisis a stronger company, and with increased confidence in our trajectory for consistent, balanced growth. We're seeking to retain incremental households. We're building on our strength in e-commerce, and we're ensuring that our emerging markets remain engines of growth for us. We're also strengthening our financial flexibility and delivering increased earnings this year for our share owners. So with that, let me turn it over to Amit, who will take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail. Thanks, Amit. Let's begin with North America on slide number 16. As we had expected and as you've seen in the scanner data, at-home consumption growth decelerated throughout the third quarter, while away-from-home channels saw some moderation in their steep declines. The result for our North America region was just under 3% organic net sales growth in quarter three. Note, while we experienced a continued though moderating double-digit decline in away-from-home sales as expected, the rest of North America business turned in a solid mid-single-digit growth performance. And while our deceleration from quarter two surge was inevitable, we're very pleased with how we performed within our primary categories. . In Canada, we grew consumption in all 6 of our primary categories, including gaining significant share and distribution in crackers with Cheez-It. In the U.S., we held our gain share in 5 of our 6 primary categories at retail as well as in the vast majority of our categories in measured away-from-home channels. We'll visit these key U.S. categories in more detail in a moment, but this end market performance is a key reason we're confident that we are strengthening our business amidst this crisis. Household penetration and buy rates have increased across our categories since the pandemic began, and we are focused on retaining as many of these consumers and occasions as we can. This relies on effective marketing and sales execution, of course, but it is also dependent on our supply chain to get food to the marketplace. Our plants are running well, still focused on throughput and still up against capacity in certain categories in food forms requiring tremendous agility. Our supply chain clearly has risen to the challenge. Operating profit decreased as planned in quarter three as brand investment was shifted out of the first half and into the second half and as we had less incremental sales to cover sustained levels of incremental COVID costs. But North America is on track for a very good year of net sales and operating profit growth. Let's take a quick look at each of our 3 major category groupings in North America, starting with our largest snacks on slide number 17. North America snacks continued to post strong growth, even if at-home demand decelerated from quarter two's highs and away-from-home channels and on-the-go pack formats remained in decline. In the U.S., Pringles continued to post double-digit consumption growth, holding share despite continued softness in on-the-go pack formats as expected. In crackers, we continue to outpace the category's solid mid-single-digit growth in the quarter. Cheez-It Snap'd continues to grow strongly in its second year, supported by recently added capacity while accompaniment oriented cracker brands, Club, Townhouse and Carr's have collectively gained share as well. In portable wholesome snacks, the category remains pressured by reduced on-the-go occasions during the pandemic. And while this has impacted on-the-go brands in our portfolio like RX and Kashi, we've been able to gain share on the strength of our growing Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies treats brands. So our snack brands business is in great shape. Now let's turn to North America cereal on slide number 18. Our North America cereal net sales grew again in quarter three, though reflecting a deceleration in the category in retail channels and continued declines in away-from-home channels. But what is so encouraging is what we're doing within the category. In U.S. measured retail channels, we again outpaced the category. And we did it on the strength of renewed advertising support and refreshed messaging for brands like Special K and Mini-Wheats and on innovation like JUMBO SNAX and MASHUPS that have helped us lead the category in share of innovation this year. We have added more household penetration during the pandemic, and we've held on to more of it than the category. And the same goes for buy rates. Our enhanced data and analytics give us the ability to target the right consumer and occasion with the right messaging for that consumer and occasion, and we're seeing the results. So we're executing well in North America cereal. We're also executing well in North America frozen foods, shown on slide number 19. Our North America frozen foods categories didn't decelerate as much as cereal and snacks during quarter three. And as a result, we continue to deliver high single-digit organic net sales growth. And that is despite capacity constraints and declines in away-from-home channels as well as the phasing out of certain non-core product lines. Our core businesses are performing very well. In U.S. retail channels, our Eggo brand grew consumption by almost 13% in the quarter, with strong growth in waffles, French toast and pancakes and continuing to gain share. Our MorningStar Farms brand grew consumption by nearly 18%, trailing the frozen veg vegan category's exceptional growth as we ramp up against our capacity. MorningStar Farms meat alternative sub-brand Incogmeato was launched during the quarter. It's early days, and we're still building up our distribution, but we have launched burgers, sausage bratwurst and ground beef into the refrigerated aisle. And into the frozen aisle, we've launched Disney-shaped chicken nuggets, the first kid-oriented offering in this plant-based category. We are expecting a gradual distribution build, and we're confident about our food, branding and breadth of offerings. So like our other North American businesses, frozen foods is performing very well. As we look to the remainder of the year for Kellogg North America, we expect the deceleration in at-home demand growth that we discussed earlier. We're focused on restoring service levels, particularly in capacity type brands and categories, and we'll continue to reinvest the funds we deferred from the first half. We have no doubt we will emerge from 2020 with a stronger North America business. Now let's discuss our international businesses, starting with Europe on slide number 20. Kellogg Europe posted its 12th consecutive quarter of organic net sales growth in quarter three. Growth decelerated as expected as the COVID-led surge in at-home cereal demand moderated, while declines persisted in away-from-home channels. In cereal, our net sales increased at a low single-digit rate in the quarter. Category growth rates finished the quarter in roughly that range, and we added to our year-to-date share gains in key markets across the region. In snacks, our net sales were down very slightly in the quarter. Pringles growth improved from last quarter, led by accelerated consumption and share growth in the UK. Even amidst altered commercial plans because of COVID, we've gained share this year in our 3 biggest markets in the region: the UK, Germany and Russia. Meanwhile, portable wholesome snacks continued to feel the impact of fewer on-the-go occasions during the quarter as expected, though its declines moderated from the previous quarter. Overall, in emerging markets, namely Russia and Central Europe, we experienced a decline in net sales reflecting challenging economic conditions, particularly in snacks. The good news is that cereal remained in solid growth, and Pringles has gained share. As in our other regions, Europe reinvested a good portion of brand building that had been delayed from the first half. This is important for solidifying our competitive positions, and we'll see this again in quarter four. So we really like how we've been executing in Kellogg Europe. Let's turn to the Kellogg Latin America on slide number 21. Given the challenging macro conditions in this region, we had expected decelerating net sales growth. Instead, Kellogg Latin America posted double-digit organic growth, and this double-digit growth was broad-based across all 4 sub-regions: Mexico, Brazil, Pacific, and Caribbean and Central America. The growth was again led by double-digit organic net sales growth in cereal, whose consumption growth remained elevated in modern trade channels even if we did see category growth rates decelerate during the quarter. Snacks, which has been negatively impacted by the pandemic lockdown and recessionary environment, bounced back in quarter three with low single-digit organic net sales growth. Leading this growth was our business in Brazil, where local production and a new strategic distribution partner are benefiting Pringles, and we continue to gain share in cookies. Higher net sales more than offset adverse transactional foreign exchange and COVID-related costs, not to mention a significant double-digit increase in brand building. Profit growth also continued to lap last year's costly distributor transitions as well as start-up of local production in Brazil. So we're performing well in spite of tough conditions. We expect decelerating at-home demand to slower cereal sales in quarter four, and we faced some uncertainty in Mexico regarding new labeling regulations, which we've mentioned previously, and we'll see another quarter of increased brand building. Nevertheless, we're clearly executing well in Latin America in a difficult macroeconomic environment while also reinvesting for the future. And finally, we'll discuss AMEA, shown on slide number 22. Like Latin America, AMEA turned in better-than-expected double-digit organic net sales growth. Growth was broad-based across Australia, Asia, Africa and the Middle East and across cereal, snacks, noodles and other. As you can see on the chart, cereal demand remained elevated in many markets. The result was high single-digit organic net sales for cereal in the region but just as important have been the share gains we realized in key markets like Australia, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and South Africa.  In snacks, double-digit organic net sales growth was led by Pringles, which returned to growth momentum as we restored supply. Category growth rates have moderated, but we gained share in Australia and key markets in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. In noodles and other products, double-digit organic growth in net sales reflected expansion of our Kellogg noodles in the Middle East and South Africa as well as a strong sequential acceleration in growth for Multipro, the distributor portion of our business in West Africa. This business showed great resilience in a difficult environment in quarter three. Like our other regions, AMEA increased its brand building at a double-digit rate in the quarter, reflecting investment that we shifted from the first half, but the same sales growth and operating leverage was enough to more than offset this investment. We do expect slower growth in AMEA in quarter four, reflecting not only the deceleration we've been seeing in cereal categories throughout the region. But also the impact of COVID-related school closings, which affect important school programs we supply in North Africa. And it will be tested further by protests currently disrupting business in Nigeria. But there's no question, we are executing well in AMEA, managing through some challenging macro conditions while continuing to invest for the long-term. Let's wrap up with a brief summary on slide number 24. First of all, I'm incredibly proud of the way our organization has rallied to execute well through unprecedented and challenging conditions. Everything starts with protecting our people, and we are indeed keeping each other safe. We're also doing a good job supplying the marketplace, and we're supporting our communities. We're preserving and enhancing our financial flexibility. To do all this in a time of turmoil and uncertainty is a testament to the character of this organization. Second, we're pleased with our end market performance. Even having to replan our commercial calendar, we're executing well in the marketplace. We've expanded household penetration. We're growing across retail channels, notably in e-commerce, and we're finding ways to adjust to difficult conditions in away-from-home channels. Importantly, we're holding or gaining share in most of our markets, notably in the U.S., where we held or gained share in the majority of our retail categories and our categories in away-from-home channels. This reflects how we are competing. Third, we're pleased by our performance in emerging markets. In spite of challenging conditions, we've continued to grow in these markets with much less slowdown than we anticipated. This is a credit to our experienced management teams, our diversified geographic footprint, our local supply chains and the strength and breadth of our portfolio. And fourth, we're happy to be over-delivering our financial plan this year. We are again raising our full year guidance for net sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow, which has us getting ahead of our plans for enhancing financial flexibility. And we're doing this without cutting back on reinvestment in brands and capabilities. In fact, we've stepped up our investment, which will help us long into the future. In summary, we are confident that we will emerge from this crisis an even stronger company. We've reached new households and supported our most powerful brands. We've enhanced capabilities such as data and analytics, e-commerce and revenue growth management. We've strengthened our supply chain, and we've optimized SKUs. And we've strengthened our portfolio and operations in emerging markets. Our goal is sustained balance between top-line and cash flow growth, and we are on firmer footing now more than ever. And with that, we'll open it up for your questions. Yes. Thanks for the question, Nik. First of all, you can see what we've done in terms of our marketing and brand building investments. So we're concentrating that in the back half of the year as we said we would. So we've got lots of funds directed exactly at that. The second thing is we have really enhanced our data and analytics. So we have a better understanding now more than ever about consumers and occasions at a very granular level. So the messaging that we're getting out there, digital, social and otherwise is directed in a more micro way against consumers and occasions that drive the type of behaviors that we want. And we're seeing real results. So if I gave you just a couple of examples. In terms of penetration, the RTEC category is growing penetration, not quite at 1%. And we're more than double that at nearly 2% RTEC penetration, and we're also retaining those households. Same thing in salty snacks. So it's really about understanding the consumer, the consumer occasion, what drives behavior in getting that message out there. And we've got a lot of investment behind that. So more to go. We're pleased with where we are, but it's really based on the fundamental improvements in data and analytics and our ability to micro target against those consumers supplemented with the right level of investment behind it. Yes, Steve. We were very pleased with the performance in emerging markets in this quarter, obviously. It was led by cereal, which saw elevated demand based on some of the lockdowns. We continue to expand our noodles business very successfully. So we're pleased about that. But in quarter four, obviously, we see the potential for some slowdowns, which is what we talked about. We've got unusual situations, the school closings in North Africa. That's a big bit of business for us. The labeling regulations in Mexico, uncertain how -- if and how that will impact the business. It's across really all consumer packages. So hard to say. And then Nigeria, obviously, in the news very much, as you can see with protests and disruption which disrupts our business, has disrupted our business there. So always watch outs in emerging markets to be sure and when you have this type of environment, coupled with the recessionary environment, you always want to stay close and watch it. But very proud of the way the organization in quarter three came through in emerging markets and delivered a better-than-expected performance. Yes. So thanks for the question, Ken. Obviously, we're not going to get into any 2021 guidance at this stage. We're still working through our plans. But when we talked about emerging as a stronger company, we're making lasting impact to the business. You see that in the financial flexibility, the type of cash we've been able to generate. You see that especially in the investment in the brands and capabilities that we're putting into the marketplace to drive penetration, to drive retention, to keep those households. You see that in our digital and e-commerce capability that we're continuing to invest in. And then our supply chain, as I said, very proud of our supply chain in the way they've been able to be agile and meet this unheard of kind of surge in demand and this lengthy -- the length at which it's occurred. And so we're investing in capability and capacity in the longer-term in our supply chain as well, which we mentioned. So all of those things give us very good confidence that we are emerging stronger. And when we get to February, we'll talk about it in more detail what that looks like. Amit, do you want to add anything? Yes. No, I think I just -- exactly, it's confidence in the trajectory based on the investments that we just talked about. And it's -- as you know, Ken, there's so much uncertainty right now. How long this goes, what consumer behavior really changes and how it lasts. And so we're leaning into it. We're very much leaning into it, but we believe that this crisis is terrible as it's been, has given us an opportunity to really engage with consumers in meaningful and lasting ways and to make those investments to emerge stronger. Yes. Thanks, Ken. Again, there's so many things that are unknowable right now. And so it's really our planning assumptions. And to the best of our ability, what we're thinking of is the away-from-home channels, as we talked about, not really recovering very quickly. We're weighted towards schools and travel and leisure. So the ones that are recovering, convenience and so forth. Your QSR, you're starting to see stabilize, but not where we're weighted. And then in terms of retail channels, we were talking about in the third quarter about a deceleration. It did decelerate. It continues to decelerate. At what level it stops and starts to go back up again? Is an unknowable. We see the same news reports. We obviously see the same terrible trends in the COVID virus. And so this is our planning assumption, and we hope for a recovery, obviously, as everybody does in terms of these lockdowns and so forth. But to the best of our ability, this is what we see. And at a point in time, you just have to make a call and say, the continuation of the deceleration is what we see. But you have to be agile, just in case that changes. Yes, thanks, Bryan. So the first thing I'd say is, it's early days, obviously. And we're all learning what it means to launch a new brand in a pandemic environment where shoppers' behaviors are different, right? And so we've talked about how big brands are resonating. People trust big brands. They get in and out. The shopping experience as quickly as they can. And so we do believe that launching Incogmeato under the halo of the MorningStar Farms brand gives it a real advantage. And when you look at MorningStar Farms, up I think it's 27% year-to-date through quarter three, obviously really strong growth and again launching Incogmeato underneath that. And it was really scheduled for a March 31 launch. We had to delay that based on retailer resets. We have got our burger, our ground bratwurst and sausage products off. We're launching our Disney chicken nuggets. We're very strong in chicken and obviously the Disney franchise, and this is a Mickey offering. We think we'll get a lot of traction. And so the national distribution is really just building as we speak, but we're pleased with where we are. We're pleased with the early returns, but it is very early. So everything that we talked about in terms of the strategy, we think holds true, particularly the strength of the product offering itself and the strength of launching under the MorningStar Farms halo, we believe still remain very relevant. But we're vigilant. We've got our sales organization out there each and every day, checking on placements, and doing everything they can to advance the visibility of Incogmeato in the marketplace. Yes. So capacity, we ran up against capacity. Nobody planned for 27% growth, obviously, but we've got -- in the short-term really working on crewing and getting everything we can in terms of throughput. And as we enter 2021, we do have plans for additional lines and so more significant capacity coming on. So in short-term, it's about crewing and throughput. In the longer-term or the medium term, which is really next year, it's about additional lines to really add to capacity, because we see this as a lasting. You're not going to see this type of elevated demand, I would suspect, going forward. But plant-based is a real megatrend. It was before the pandemic, and the type of trial that you're seeing is really going to we think accelerate what was already a meaningful trend in this space. Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael. What I'd say is, right now the priority is the United States. It's a huge opportunity. MorningStar Farms is a very big brand. So clearly, winning in the U.S. is -- and competing in the U.S. is the number 1 priority for us. We are, outside the U.S., in Australia, New Zealand, currently. And so we are experimenting, and we'll see what the opportunity is and how it presents itself. But we believe that priority 1 is the United States because of the size of the market and because of the advantage we have having MorningStar Farms as a very established brand. Yes, thanks, David. So we have put money behind our brands. We've put investment behind our brands. And we've seen the benefits of that flowing through. And we are singularly focused on balanced growth. So we're pleased with the top-line performance pre-COVID and obviously we get the bump from COVID. And when you look at the financial results of this year, based on the new guidance that we just updated today, you see a P&L that looks very solid and very balanced with good top-line growth, margins improving and a nice bottom-line performance. And so we also like the type of investment that we have currently behind our brands, when you think about it as a percentage of net sales, for example. And so as we think forward, we like where we are in terms of our brand-building spend, and we would see that continuing. So we don't see any great need for a big insurgent into any particular area. We benefited from being able to invest this year. In particular when you think about the level of investment in the second half of the year because of the COVID crisis, we had this concentration of lots of consumer messaging going into the back half of this year, into the fourth quarter, we believe will allow us to enter 2021 with lots of good momentum and lots of brand building and equity that's been invested into our brands. And so we like where we stand today in terms of the health of our brands and the momentum of our brands. Yes, thanks, Chris. So roughly speaking, we got about a third of it off in the third quarter. And so we're obviously planning on two-thirds of it off in the fourth quarter, which leads to double-digit brand building against various platforms. That's on top of what we had already planned. And so that's what I was just saying in the previous question. That's why we've got this concentration of really good brand messaging happening in the back half of the year and with good ROIs. And so we're very pleased with the type of performance we're getting from it. But remember, too, that these are -- a lot of this is to build the longer-term equity of our brands and enter 2021 with good momentum.  Now having said all that, there's all this uncertainty, right? And so what happens with everything from movie releases to college football bowls in the fourth quarter remains an uncertainty. So we'll continue to have to be agile in how we think about where the right places to invest are, but we're determined to invest against our brands to continue to build the equity, to drive the right ROIs and to enter 2021 with real solid momentum. Yes, thanks, Rob. So for the full year, we'll be up mid-single digits ex the divestiture, right? And we'll be up, as I just mentioned, double-digits in the second half of the year. And so that's why I talk about 2021 entering with real momentum. And we believe that, that gives us the right level from a percentage of sales, roughly speaking, of where we want to be. Now we always reserve the right with great ROIs and great ideas to go plus or minus. But when you look at the momentum that we've got in our net sales pre-COVID and what we built last year, we felt like we were getting significantly good returns on our advertising spend last year. And if you'll recall, we exited fourth quarter with 2.7% growth, and that was pre-COVID. So we were clearly getting the benefit of the type of investments that we were making over the course of the last 3 years, really. And so -- and they came with some surges and some tactical movements around. But if you just go back to the top-line and see the top-line momentum that was building over the course of last year, we feel like we were deploying that advertising spending in very good ways, with good returns that were getting us exactly what we wanted. And obviously, this year, everything went completely into replanning after COVID. But again, we'll finish the year with mid-single-digit advertising spend ex-divestiture with real momentum in the back half of the year because of the concentration and double-digit nature of the investment in quarter three and quarter four. It's a slight increase, Rob, to the original plan, but pretty close. And so if you recall last quarter, on our earnings, I talked about how we were bound and determined to spend what we had planned on spending, and that gives us the type of concentration in the second half and the momentum. So up slightly from even that, but just slightly. But you can think about it kind of in terms of spending our full year allocated budget against our brands. Yes, Jason. It really -- you didn't point to the double-digit declines in away-from-home channels, and that's a sizable portion of our business as well as the on-the-go pack formats. If you take away those declines in away-from-home in particular, the rest of the business was up mid-single digits, right? And if you look at our consumption, you can see that as well, up mid-single-digits. So it really is the away-from-home channels that drove that. Yes. The answer to that is yes. And now there's a great deal of uncertainty, obviously, with what really happens with schools. And we all see that in our daily lives. Schools going back and then going into hybrid and then getting shut down. And so it's a very fluid situation. But from a consumption standpoint, we still see the elevated demand, and we still see the benefits of COVID, but it is definitely counterbalanced by the away-from-home softness. Operator, we are at 10:30. So we're going to have to wrap it up."

            "content": "Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Slide number 9 summarizes our results for the third quarter and first nine months. As Steve mentioned, our third quarter results came in better-than-anticipated, particularly on operating profit and cash flow. Net sales benefited from elevated at-home demand during the crisis, though this clearly moderated across countries and categories over the course of the quarter and was partially offset by continued softness in away-from-home channels. An important highlight of the quarter was the strength of our emerging markets, whose return to double-digit growth came despite very challenging conditions, including economic and COVID impacts on the traditional trade.  Operating profit increased on a reported basis because of a reduction in one-time charges. Now that recent years' substantial restructurings are largely behind us, it declined on an adjusted basis because of the absence of businesses divested last year, as well as higher expense for performance-based compensation and a significant planned increase in advertising and consumer promotion. Operating profit declined less than we expected in large part because of our positive performance in net sales and gross profit margin.  Earnings per share declined with operating profit along with an effective tax rate that was higher than last year as expected. And cash flow continue to come in better-than-planned, bringing our year-to-date cash flow above what had been our forecast for the full year, a reflection of our elevated earnings, reduced restructuring outlays, good working capital management and capital expenditure that has been delayed during the pandemic. Let's take a look at these metrics in more detail. We will start with net sales growth on slide number 10. While moderating from recent quarters, currency translation was a negative impact of about 1% in the quarter, largely due to Latin American currency's devaluation against the U.S. dollar. Last year's divestiture of our Keebler Cookies, pie crusts, ice cream cones and fruit snacks anniversaries at the time end of July. So, we had one month of impact in the quarter, pulling down net sales by just under 2 percentage points.  Organic net sales growth was 4.5% in the quarter. We had anticipated a meaningful deceleration from last quarter's 9% growth. And sure enough, we did indeed see a moderation in at-home consumption growth across our categories, and continued softness in away-from-home channels and on-the-go products.  Nevertheless, this quarter three organic growth performance was very promising. It was driven by organic growth across all four regions, and across all four global category groups. It also featured a better balance between volume and price mix, and it was supported by consumption growth and share gains in key categories and markets in turn buoyed by effective brand building activity.  Now, let's turn our discussion to profit margins with slide number 11. Going into the quarter, we had assumed that gross profit margin would contract a bit in quarter three, as we anticipated less net sales growth to cover sustained incremental COVID costs. However, our gross profit margin ended up expanding slightly as growth, productivity and price realization more than offset a resumed mix shift towards emerging markets, including Multipro, our distributor business in Nigeria. We expect to see gross profit margin to expand modestly again in quarter four, and therefore for the full year, despite sustained incremental COVID costs.  Another important impact on our operating profit margin was our increase in brand investment. Back in July, we discussed the postponement of advertising and consumer promotions during the height of the pandemic in the first half and our intention to reinvest those funds into brand building during quarter three and quarter four. The slide shows that delay in advertising and consumer promotion during quarter two, and how it was followed by a double-digit increase in quarter three, along with a similar double-digit increase planned for quarter four. This, along with an increase in expense for performance-based compensation, was the primary driver of our operating profit decline in quarter three, and will be again in quarter four.  Below operating profit, our interest expense remained below last year as expected. Other income, which is predominantly related to our pension plans, remained higher year-on-year also as expected, reflecting the impact of higher asset valuations at the beginning of the year. These favorable items were more than offset by the earnings per share, by a higher effective tax rate and an increase in average shares outstanding as we continue to refrain from share buybacks to prioritize financial flexibility during the current crisis.  That brings us to cash flow and capital structure on slide number 12. A lasting impact of this year will be the stronger than projected cash flow, enabling a faster than expected reduction in net debt. As shown on the top graph, our cash flow this year has significantly outpaced that of the past couple of years, even beyond lapping unusual outlays in each of the prior two year-to-date periods. As I mentioned, this is a result of higher than expected adjusted basis earnings this year, as well as the fact that we have gotten past the major restructurings and reorganizations of the last few years, which had required significant cash outlays but it also reflects our effective management of core working capital and the capital expenditure we've had to prioritize or delay during the pandemic so as to not impede capacity utilization in any way. This cash flow has enabled further increases in liquidity and further reductions in net debt as shown on the bottom chart. Strong liquidity and lower net debt against stronger cash flow give us enhanced financial flexibility. Let's now discuss our rest of year outlook starting with slide number 13 and our planning assumptions around the pandemic for the fourth quarter. While the direction of the pandemic remains uncertain, we are making certain planning assumptions. To that end, we assume that at-home demand growth will continue to decelerate, while sizable away-from-home sales declines moderate. These are simply continuations of trends we have seen in recent months. The reason we assume our away-from-home sales will take longer to stabilize is because of our weighting in segments like schools and travel and lodging, which are expected to take longer to recover. We also assume that growth in emerging markets will decelerate amidst COVID-related economic softness as well as some unusual market-specific factors in quarter four, such as school food programs being shut down in North Africa and the impact of new labeling regulations going into effect in Mexico. And finally, there is the investment that we delayed from the first half. Just as in quarter three, this first half funding will be implemented during quarter four on top of previously planned activity. The result should be another double-digit increase in advertising and consumer promotions in quarter four.  Slide number 14 shows what this all means for our full year outlook. As Steve mentioned, we are once again raising our guidance for the year. This time, to reflect our better-than-expected quarter three results, less any timing related factors from that quarter unless some incremental investments that we're adding to quarter four. Our full year guidance for organic net sales growth improves to just about 6% from our previous guidance of around 5%. This reflects our better-than-expected 4.5% growth in quarter three and a modest increase to our outlook for quarter four, though the latter still assumes a deceleration for the reasons we just discussed. Our full year guidance for currency-neutral adjusted basis operating profit improves to growth of approximately 2% from our previous guidance for a decline of about 1%. This positive swing reflects our better-than-forecast operating profit in quarter three with some timing-related shifts in costs into quarter four, along with the incremental advertising and promotion and other costs and investments I just described. This drives a similar increase in our full year guidance for currency-neutral adjusted basis, earnings per share, which goes to growth of approximately 2% from previous guidance for a decline of about 1%. Our guidance for cash flow increases to $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, a substantial improvement from our previous guidance of approximately $1 billion. This reflects our stronger-than-expected delivery in quarter three, let some elements that are likely timing-related, such as capital expenditure delayed from earlier this year. Putting it all together, we're in position to finish 2020 with a strong financial performance, featuring a good balance of growth, profitability, investment and cash generation, and we will enter 2021 in a very solid financial condition. And with that, let me turn it back to Steve for a review of each of our major businesses. And I think just to add to that, I think you look at the strength of our cash flow, I think that's allowed -- we always said that our priority this year would be to reduce our net debt, and I think the strength of our cash flow is allowing us to accelerate that net debt reduction. And so I think that allows us much more financial flexibility as we emerge out of this crisis. Yes. So I think just on the cash flow, right, there are a number of factors that are driving our improved cash flow, right? So part of it is driven by just higher earnings -- higher adjusted earnings, a significant reduction in restructuring, outlays, good working capital management that we've seen across all our businesses, and then the capital expenditure. Some of which has been delayed. Now we are hoping to catch up on capital expenditure in quarter four. And that has been reflected in our outlook, with planned downtime to get some of the CapEx away, and some of it will be delayed. But I think, as Steve mentioned, right, from a CapEx standpoint, I think our focus is on getting the capacity in all our constrained platforms as quickly as possible. So I would say part of it -- part of the cash flow is timing and phasing. But equally, a part of it is as well just sustained improvement in our earnings, in our reduction in restructuring as well as working capital, which we would expect to sustain. I think it depends on the platform. And I think it depends -- so in some platforms, we're running flat out to service the elevated demand. In others where we can, we're taking the opportunity to catch up on capital expenditure. So I think it varies across the platforms. So Jason, we don't -- we won't get into the specifics of trade. But I think from an overall standpoint, we're seeing the price mix come through. I think within that, there is a very marked category shift. I think we talked that in our last call, just the mix between cereal and snacks and different rates there -- different rates between the channels. I think that's probably driving some of the negatives. But overall, we're seeing price mix come through. ."

At this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Lending for Kellogg Company. Mr. Renwick, you may begin your conference call.\nJohn Renwick: Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for a review of our second quarter results as well as updates regarding our outlook for 2020. I'm joined this morning by Steve Cahillane, our Chairman, and CEO; and Amit Banati, our Chief Financial Officer. Slide 3 shows our forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware, certain statements made today such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance, are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to this third slide of the presentation as well as to our public SEC filings. This is a particular note during the current COVID-19 pandemic when the length and severity of the crisis and resultant economic and business impacts are so difficult to predict. A replay of today's conference call will be available by phone through Thursday, August 6. The call will also be available via webcast, which will be archived for at least 90 days on the Investor page of kelloggcompany.com. As always, when referring to our results and outlook, unless otherwise noted, we will be referring to them on a currency-neutral basis for net sales. And on a currency-neutral adjusted basis for operating profit and earnings per share. And now I'll turn it over to Steve.\nSteven Cahillane: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. These are certainly unusual and troubling times. The pandemic drags on with cases rising again in many states and countries that had just begun to reopen. And recent events around racial injustices have only added to an environment that is both uncertain and worrisome. It goes without saying that these crises have touched us all in some way, and our hearts go out to individuals and families that have been directly affected, and we certainly hope you and your families and friends are staying safe. As a company with heart and soul, it has been very important for us to maintain ongoing communication with our stakeholders about what we are doing to keep each other safe.  How we continue to supply our markets with food and how we are giving back to our communities. We've also worked to increase our open dialogue about diversity and inclusion, which we deem to be inherent in our company's values. This is included stepped-up actions like incremental donations to the NAACP, town halls, and testimonials by employees, professors, and authors, and we will continue to do so.  So we are certainly operating in unprecedented times. And from our employees on the front lines, in our plants and distribution centers and now back in stores, to our employees working from their homes, this organization has come together and rallied to the occasion like nothing I've ever seen before. From a business perspective, turning to Slide 5, we're managing well through the crisis. Our 1 priority, of course, has been keeping our employees and their families safe as best as we can. We've talked previously about the investments and process changes we have made, and we will remain vigilant to protect our people. We've told you that we feel we have an incredible responsibility in supplying food during this time. I'm happy to report that we've experienced no major supply disruptions and managed to increase our production and keep up our service levels in spite of higher-than-expected demand in many markets. We continue to aid our communities through volunteer hours and through what is now nearly $15 million in cash and food donations that we've made since this crisis began. These are our priorities during the crisis, and we are executing well against them. Turning to Slide 6. It was in the usual quarter, to say the least. In addition to executing against our crisis priorities, we again delivered exceptional results in the second quarter, even amidst a very uncertain environment and new unusual ways of working. Our net sales came in much higher than expected. We'd assume that at-home consumption growth would decelerate meaningfully during the second quarter, but with prolonged prices, it held up higher and for longer than we had forecast. And in some of our categories, retailers were able to catch up to demand and rebuild inventory. Meanwhile, declines in away-from-home channels persisted, and our emerging markets did not slow down as much as we had expected given COVID disruptions and recessionary conditions.  We also generated higher-than-expected operating profit. The higher-than-projected volume ran through our well-utilized plants, driving strong operating leverage. This more than offset significant incremental COVID-related costs in the quarter, mainly around safety, employee benefits, temporary labor, and logistics. The net of this was an unusually large increase in gross profit. Our operating profit also received a temporary boost from the deferral of various investments. We again shifted brand building investments in the second half, particularly investment in activities that we tied to canceled or delayed sporting events, movie releases, and innovation launches. We also shifted some overhead and capital investment to the second half. As a result, we have seen an even larger shift of the year's operating profit into the first half. It's important to recognize that we also executed well, and there are clear signs that our underlying business is in good shape.  For instance, we continue to increase household penetration aided by our ability to get food into the market and to adjust our brand communication. There is trial, repeat, and reappraisal that can benefit us long after the crisis finally passes.  All other signs of execution include our improved category share performance, including some brands that we've been revitalizing through fresh brand messaging. And our supply chain is operating well, gradually improving our service levels amidst unusually challenging circumstances. All of these contributed to an outsized financial delivery in Q2. So let's discuss what this means for our full year, turning to Slide 7. We recognize that many companies have refrained from giving guidance in this uncertain environment, and we can understand why. There are a number of variables that are extremely uncertain right now. So today, we're going to offer you our planning stance for the second half and how we are approaching some of these variables, and we are raising our full year guidance to reflect our over-delivery in the first half. From a net sales standpoint, our increased full year outlook reflects the strong growth we delivered in the first half as well as a slightly improved top-line outlook for the second half. We won't get more aggressive than that because too many variables are simply too uncertain. From a profit and earnings standpoint, we do know that our second half profit will be weighted down by investment. Most of this increased second half investment is simply shifted from the first and second quarters, the result of focusing on supply and postponing promotional activity tied to canceled events. Specifically, in the second half, we plan to return to full commercial programming and to completely invest our full year brand building budget.  Again, there are many unique assumptions that we have to make in formulating an outlook right now. The length and severity of the COVID crisis and related economic recession is not knowable. But Amit will walk you through our key planning assumptions in a moment. Suffice it to say, we feel very good about having a front-weighted profit delivery this year and a strengthened commercial plan for the second half. So with that, let me turn it over to Amit, who will take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail.\nAmit Banati: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with Slide 9 and a reminder of our financial approach during the crisis. Employee safety is the top priority, and we will continue to invest in this area in safety supplies, temperature checks, and incremental cleaning protocols as well as information technology to facilitate working remotely. To supply the market with food, we've continued to focus production on priority SKUs, utilize temporary labor where necessary, and reward our frontline workers with bonuses and benefits. We've also invested in logistics to get food to our customers as quickly as possible. We've continued to ensure financial flexibility which is particularly important in this environment of economic recession and volatile financial markets.  Our cash flow has been very strong, enabling us to carry higher-than-usual cash balances and shows strong liquidity and reduce debt leverage. And we've remained committed to investing in the future. As Steve mentioned, the crisis led us to defer some commercial activity and investments to the second half, and we plan to execute not only those shifted investments but also incremental investments that can be funded by our strong first half earnings and cash flow. So this is the context in which we view our financial results and outlook. Slide 10 summarizes our results for the second quarter and first half. As Steve mentioned, these strong results reflect good execution in an unprecedented environment. There really were 2 big factors that exceeded our expectations for the quarter. First, at-home consumption in developed markets did decelerate through the quarter, but not nearly as quickly as we had anticipated back in April, particularly as we improved our share performance in key markets and categories.  And second, our emerging markets did slow amidst lockdowns and economic slowdowns, but we managed through them well and they did not slow by as much as we had expected. From a margin perspective, the better-than-expected volume and very strong supply chain execution resulted in greater operating leverage than expected, more than offsetting higher incremental COVID costs, which amounted to more than $20 million in quarter two, a sizable increase from quarter 1. We also found ourselves having to delay more brand investment into the second half than previously anticipated, acting with agility to shift plans due to postponed events and supply constraints. These were the key underlying drivers in the quarter. On top of that, of course, was the mechanical impact of last year's divestiture. The absence of those businesses' results negatively impacted organic net sales by approximately 6% in quarter two and about 8% year-to-date. Its negative impact on adjusted basis operating profit was more than 8% in quarter two and 10% year-to-date. We lapped the divestiture this week. So we'll have only 1 month impact in quarter three. Below operating profit, we continue to prioritize debt reduction, making no share buybacks in the quarter and reducing our interest expense on lower net debt. Other income benefited from changes to certain pension funds in the quarter, though this was offset by a higher-than-projected effective tax rate. The result of all of these is in earnings per share and cash flow that again came in ahead of pace. Taking into a little more detail, let's look at net sales growth on Slide 11. Our organic basis net sales growth was 9% year-on-year in the quarter, slightly higher than our first quarter growth. This organic growth was again driven by volume, reflecting the pandemic-related demand, which end up higher and for longer than expected.  Our price/mix was modestly negative in the quarter, owing to category and country mix. Once again, our organic net sales growth was across all 4 regions and across all 4 global category groups: snacks, cereals, frozen foods and noodles, and other.  The divestiture impact in quarter two reflects the absence of those businesses. In quarter three, we'll have only 1 month of impact translating into approximately negative 2% of net sales. Currency was adverse in quarter two, owing to the dollar strengthening against key currencies back in March. Now let's turn to profit margins on Slide 12. As we've discussed previously, our goal this year was to finish 2020 at a stable level year-on-year on gross profit margin. Obviously, the surge in at-home demand and the resultant operating leverage has moved this plan from being a gradual improvement across the year to being a front-weighted plan. During quarter two, we saw a substantial year-on-year increase in gross margin, reflecting not only operating leverage from higher volume but also a moderation of what had been a meaningfully negative margin mix trend towards emerging markets. In the pandemic-affected second quarter, emerging markets actually grew less than developed markets. In a moment, I'll discuss why we view this large quarter two gain as temporary. But this front-weighted performance does offer increased confidence in our full year outlook for gross profit margin. At the operating profit margin, the improvement was also substantial in quarter two and also mostly timing related. As we've discussed previously, a good portion of our brand-building investment had to be shifted to the second half, particularly investment that was tied to external events or innovation launches that have been postponed. We are repurposing that investment into brand activities in the second half. Let's discuss cash flow and capital structure on Slide 13. Our cash flow continued to be strong in quarter two, up significantly year-on-year. This brings our year-to-date cash flow to more than $750 million, our strongest first half performance in years, even despite the absence of businesses we divested last July. Some of this is timing. Our earnings are front half-weighted this year with significant investment delayed to the second half. And as we did not want to disrupt our supply chain during the first half, our capital expenditure is weighted to the second half as well.  However, this strong year-on-year performance also reflects continued strong working capital management and reduced cash outlays related to restructurings. The next chart on the slide shows our net debt position. A combination of last year's divestiture proceeds and strong year-to-date cash flow have enabled us to pay down debt year-on-year and carry higher-than-usual cash balances around the world. In fact, at quarter end, our cash position was again over $1 billion. Our bond offering in May was very successful, indicating confidence in our balance sheet and cash flow and resulting in low interest rates. Our liquidity is excellent. In addition to our high cash balances, we retain access to commercial paper, and we have $2.5 billion of unused backup facilities. We're taking a proactive approach to financial flexibility in an uncertain operating environment, and we feel good about our liquidity and balance sheet going into the second half. Let's now discuss our rest of year outlook, starting with Slide 14. Obviously, this is a time of tremendous uncertainty and myriad variables can yield a wide range of outcomes. We want to give you visibility into the assumptions around which we are planning for the second half, specifically related to the pandemic and our investment plans. First, we plan for net sales growth to slow in the second half. We assume that at-home demand in developed markets continue to decelerate week-to-week through quarter three. Our outlook still considers the likelihood of prolonged softness in our away-from-home channels, including channels like travel and lodging that may take longer to stabilize and recover. And we assume that our emerging markets businesses will continue to feel the impact of COVID disruption and economic recession in the second half. Next, we view much of our outsized Q2 improvement in gross profit margin to be temporary. As we enter the second half, we lap the divestiture. So that particular year-on-year benefit obviously goes away. We also assume that we'll have less operating leverage in the second half as volume slows. And we'll have some plant-related changeovers as we resume production of paused SKUs. We'll sustain much of the direct COVID costs, particularly around safety and cleaning, and we will have less productivity savings this year due to delays in capital investments during the crisis. The result is year-on-year pressure on gross margin in the second half. And finally, we will execute a substantial year-on-year increase in investment in brands and capabilities. There is principally the advertising and promotion investment that shifted out of the first half and into the second half. And on top of that, there is also some incremental investment. In addition, there is incremental overhead and capital that reflects our desire to invest behind capabilities. Simply put, we are taking the profit upside we realized in the first half and putting it to good use: investment for future growth in categories that just got more exciting. So this is how we are viewing the crisis from a financial perspective in the second half. Again, as I'm sure you can appreciate, it's hard to say how the crisis will play out. But these are the assumptions we are planning around at this time. Now let's put it all together and look at our full year guidance shown on Slide 15. As Steve mentioned, we are raising our guidance for the year. Based on our second half planning assumptions, we now expect to finish 2020 with organic net sales growth of around 5%. This implies a modest improvement to our previous growth forecast for the second half and a substantial increase to our full year guidance.  We now expect currency-neutral adjusted operating profit to decline by only about 1%, which is about 3 percentage points better than our previous guidance and still includes roughly 6 percentage points of negative impact from our divestiture. This improved profit picture reflects a sizable growth in the first half, partially offset by shifted and incremental investments coming into the second half.  This increase in investment will weigh down operating profit in quarter three, in particular. Our outlook for currency-neutral adjusted earnings per share also improves meaningfully to a year-on-year decline of only about 1%, despite a negative impact of about 5% from the divestiture. This raised EPS guidance is driven by the increased outlook for operating profit. Below operating profit, our other income line benefits from quarter 2's favorable pension changes, but this should be roughly offset by an increased tax rate, owing to some unfavorable tax items recognized in quarter two, which will put us closer to a 22.5% rate for the year. Cash flow is now forecast to be about $1 billion, the high end of our previous guidance range. This improvement reflects our raised earnings outlook, partially offset by increased capital expenditure as we invest for the future. As I said, this is our planning stance. Yes, there could be upside if at-home consumption remains more elevated than we have assumed. However, there could also be downside if emerging markets feel greater pressure from recessionary impacts or if we suffer unanticipated supply chain disruptions related to the pandemic.  We think this is an appropriate planning stance, and we are pleased to be able to raise guidance while also investing more for the future. And with that, let me turn it back to Steve for a review of each of our major businesses.\nSteven Cahillane: Thanks, Amit. I'll now do our normal walk through the regions. Even keeping in mind the uniqueness of the current environment, and therefore, the timing related benefits to sales and operating profit, we saw good underlying execution and performance in all of our regions and all 4 of the global category groups. Let's begin with North America in Slide 17. We've had a strong quarter in first half of 2020 as the pandemic has lifted demand for at-home consumption. The result was organic net sales growth of 11% in quarter two, which turned out to be even higher than our 6% growth in quarter 1. This elevated consumption was most pronounced in meal-oriented categories, which for us is cereal, frozen breakfast, and frozen veggie foods. Reversing what happened in quarter 1, shipment growth in quarter two to retail channels exceeded consumption growth, mainly in cereal, suggesting replenishment of retailers' inventory. We were also rebuilding our own inventory during quarter two, helping us to improve our service levels and adding to an unusually large margin benefit from operating leverage in the quarter. This, too, has a timing element to it. Not surprisingly, our away-from-home business declined sharply in quarter two, though we managed it well. We've mitigated sales declines in the schools channel by shifting toward emergency feeding programs and our declines in convenience stores have begun to moderate. That said, our sales in the restaurants remain down sharply, and we are seeing our sharpest declines in vending and travel and lodging, with the latter likely to remain soft for some time. In Canada, we recorded double-digit organic net sales growth, led by elevated consumption growth in cereal and frozen breakfast and veggie foods as well as our expansion of Cheez-It. Importantly, we gained share in 4 of our 6 main categories there. North America's profit growth was notably strong in quarter two, and this reflects the unusually high operating leverage and a shift of investment to the second half. Let's take a look at each of our 3 major category groupings in North America, starting with our largest, snacks, on Slide 18. This is the business affected by the divestiture. But on an organic basis, it had another good quarter with net sales increasing 6% year-on-year. Our crackers consumption in the U.S. increased by almost 9% in quarter two, gaining share of the category.  Cheez-It continue to grow at a double-digit rate, and we also saw share gains by our Club and Cars brands reflecting their orientation toward at-home occasions as a company man crackers. In salty snacks, Pringles grew consumption by almost 12%, modestly trailing the category because of declines in immediate consumption pack formats. The brand's core four flavors collectively grew in line with the category. In portable wholesome snacks, we've gained share behind double-digit growth in Pop-Tarts and continued growth in Rice Krispies Treats. These brands are more than offsetting softness in the overall category, which has been declining because of the on-the-go nature of so many of its products. For us, this has included RXBAR. As we move to the second half, we expect to see moderating at-home consumption growth against tougher year-ago comparisons, but with the resumption of commercial programming and investment. Now let's turn to North America cereal and Slide 19. The U.S. and Canadian cereal categories continued to see elevated levels of consumption during quarter two. And in both markets, our quarter two net sales got further lift from replenishing retailer inventories. In the United States, our cereal consumption was up almost 16% year-on-year, outpacing the category. Importantly, we are gaining share not only behind taste/fun brands like Froot Loops but also behind health and wellness-oriented brands that we set out to revitalize this year through refreshed messaging and media. Special K gained share in quarter two as is Mini-Wheats and Raisin Bran. We are also excited about the consumer trial and rediscovery we are seeing from new and lapsed users in cereal. Household penetration continued to rise sequentially and year-over-year in quarter two, and we are tailoring our messaging and media to reaching out to these consumers. We're not only growing consumption faster than the category but we're also increasing household penetration faster than the category. As we enter the second half, we've returned to normal merchandising activity. Not only versus the first half when investment was delayed but also against last year when we were only just coming out of the pack-sized harmonization during the year ago third quarter. We're certainly encouraged by the momentum we're building in our cereal business. Now let's turn to our North America frozen foods Business and Slide 20. These categories saw very elevated at-home demand continue in quarter two, driving very strong net sales growth. In what we call the frozen from the griddle category, our Eggo brand posted consumption growth of about 26% during the quarter, gaining substantial share, while our Kashi brand grew about 19%. We outpaced each of the category's 3 product segments: waffles, pancakes, and french toast, aided by strong innovation and renovation we have done over the past year. In frozen veggie foods, our Morningstar Farms brand grew consumption by more than 31% in the quarter, failing to keep up with the category only because we ran up against our capacity in the quarter. Both of these categories are seeing increased household penetration.  So even as at-home demand inevitably decelerates, we see an opportunity to increase our communication to take advantage of the increased household penetration. Indeed, in the second half, we will be investing in this communication as well as in the launch of Incogmeato. You'll recall that this is the refrigerated sub-line of our Morningstar Farms brand, whose launch was deferred to the second half because of retailer resets getting delayed because of the crisis.  So another big quarter for Kellogg North America. And even though much of its first half profit growth will reverse in quarter three and quarter 4 when we see growth rates moderate and our investments get executed, there's no doubt that our business in North America will emerge from 2020 much stronger. Now let's discuss our international businesses, starting with Europe on Slide 21. Europe had another solid quarter. Specifically, we realized elevated cereal consumption growth across all of our key markets in Europe as shown on the slide. And equally importantly, we've gained share in each of our top 5 cereal markets namely the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. Our Krave brand, known as Tresor in some markets, is up 25% year-to-date and has become the 1 cereal brand in Europe.  Special K, the 3 cereal brand in Europe, has kept up with the category so far this year, attributed to our packaging and messaging overhauls. Coco Pops, another brand in Europe's top 5 also outpaced the category. So between at-home demand rising during the pandemic and strong execution and share gains by our team, our cereal net sales grew at a double-digit rate in quarter two. Our net sales in snacks, however, declined in the quarter as expected. You'll recall that with the cancellation of the Euro Cup soccer tournament, we had to cancel a 360-degree marketing program that was a strong plan to grow Pringles on top of 2 years of exceptional summer programs.  Due to the agility and creativity of our brand team, we were able to move to a combination of smaller programs, which successfully held Europe's Pringles sales flat year-on-year. Our only soft spot in the quarter was portable wholesome snacks, whose on-the-go orientation has pulled down the entire category and our share remained relatively stable. As we focused on supplying the market with food, we did defer more of Kellogg Europe's overall brand investment to the second half, which effectively shifted profit into the first half and out of the second half. We're very pleased with how we are executing in Europe. Let's turn to Latin America and Slide 22. Amidst a growing COVID crisis and an uncertain economic environment, our Latin American business is performing well. Net sales in the quarter grew 14% on an organic basis during quarter two, which was much more than we expected for two reasons. First, at home demand growth actually accelerated in this region as the COVID outbreak worsened.  This was especially the case for meal-oriented categories in the modern trade channels. For us, this had a major effect on cereal, and we saw double-digit consumption growth in key cereal markets across the region during quarter two. And second, retailers proceeded with their summer promotions as normal in June, whereas we had anticipated some execution delays given COVID limitations. The result was higher-than-expected cereal net sales which more than offset impacts of recessionary economic environment and general softness in snacking categories, particularly in high-frequency stores or mom-and-pop's and on-the-go channels. Our snacking categories have not seen a lift in demand, particularly in on-the-go-oriented categories like wholesome snacks, and particularly in markets like Brazil where high-frequency stores predominate. The good news is that Pringles continued to grow consumption and gain share in key markets like Mexico and Brazil. With COVID cases on the rise and an economy that is clearly soft, we remain cautious in our outlook for Latin America's second half, particularly with new labeling restrictions in Mexico. But there is no question that our team is managing well through a difficult environment. And finally, we'll discuss EMEA, shown on Slide 23. EMEA also exceeded expectations in the second quarter. Cereal sales remained strong, sustaining a mid-single-digit growth rate as at-home consumption remained elevated in the more developed markets of the region. We also performed well within these cereal markets. In Australia and South Africa, for instance, our strong double-digit consumption growth rates were enough to gain multiple points of share in those growing cereal categories. The biggest positive surprise in the quarter was Multipro, the distributor portion of our rapidly growing business in West Africa.  COVID lockdowns and a softening economy did indeed slow growth from Multipro, but certainly not as much as we anticipated. Where we did see softness, as expected, was in snacks in the Middle East and other emerging markets like India, related to COVID disruption and slowing economies. Nevertheless, despite challenging macro environment, we still managed to deliver good top-line growth in this region in quarter two, and our profit growth was augmented further by delays in brand investment to the second half.  We see quarter 2's top-line growth remaining at a decelerated pace in the second half, given the macro environment, but we like how we are managing through the crisis overall in EMEA. So allow me to summarize with Slide 25. The company continues to execute well amidst the crisis. It hasn't been easy. It has required courage and flexibility in the part of our employees, and it has required considerable incremental costs in the form of safety and cleaning, temporary labor, additional freight, and bonuses for our deserving frontline employees, and its working. We're keeping our employees safe. We're supplying food to customers and consumers. We're giving back to the community. And we're enhancing our financial flexibility. Meanwhile, we're very grateful for our partnerships with our suppliers, and our retail customers during these challenging times. It is this execution that has enabled us to deliver even better results than we had anticipated in both quarter 1 and quarter two and both in market and our financial results.  This has important implications. We are able to raise our financial forecast for the year, delivering more net sales, more operating profit, more earnings per share, and more cash flow than we had planned. And yet, at the same time, we are also able to reinvest back in the business during the second half. This means investing to revitalize more of the brands in our portfolio and reaching out to new and lapsed users who have rediscovered our foods during the crisis. It means we can invest more in capabilities that will give us a leg up in the marketplace, such as data and analytics, digital and e-commerce, and packaging. And in the end, it means we can finish 2020 with both better-than-expected financial performance and come out a stronger company. It means we can improve our financial flexibility in a time of great uncertainty, and it only solidifies our path towards balanced and consistent growth in sales, profit, and cash flow over time. Before we close, I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our employees, their bravery, dedication, and hard work are exemplary. And their engagement during this time of crisis has been inspiring. It just reaffirms that Kellogg has a truly special culture. And with that, we'll open it up for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel.\nChristopher Growe: I had two questions for you. The first one just be -- would be there's some -- a lot of shifts and movement occurring this quarter, especially behind marketing. As we're trying to get a sense of the fixed cost leverage, no doubt that's a benefit to margins and help drive profit growth. Can you give a better sense of how that leverage took hold? Maybe how much marketing shift into the second half of the year?  I don't know if there's a way you can give kind of a gross margin discussion in terms of the various costs that occurred in the quarter as well. So I'm just trying to look at the leverage and the profit growth that occurred kind of absent the unique items.\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Thanks, Chris. I'll start, and then I think Amit will build on it. First, obviously, we had monumental changes in the first half. If you think about, at the very beginning, the March Madness, obviously being canceled, NBA on and on, everything just got canceled. So that led us to making big shifts in marketing and investment, which we plan on, as we said in the prepared remarks, to fully invest in the second half. Order of magnitude, we're talking about being as much as $60 million, 6-0 in shift from the first half into the second half, much of that advertising and promotion. And a lot of it will be weighted towards quarter three, which we're obviously in right now. You want to talk about maybe, look at the operating leverage, Amit?\nAmit Banati: Sure. So Chris, just on gross margin, obviously, we had a very strong gross margin performance in the quarter. I think if I were to kind of break down the drivers of that, the divestiture was about 60 basis points, which was just mechanical as it flowed through. We did have incremental costs related to COVID of around $22 million, so that was about a 50 basis points headwind during the quarter. Input costs were roughly neutral. So largely, the balance of the gross margin was driven really by two things: one, the operating leverage coming through, and also a positive margin mix. So as the growth was more pronounced and moved away from snacks towards RTEC and noodles that that created a positive margin mix for us in the quarter. I think as we look to the second half, we'd expect the margin mix to be neutral, and then obviously, with lower volume growth, the operating leverage would be lower in the second half. And overall, we remain confident of our guidance on a stable gross profit margin for the year.\nChristopher Growe: And just in relation to that leverage point you made, did the increase in inventories that occurred, both your own and at retail, did that -- how much does that contribute to the gross margin then?\nAmit Banati: Well, I think it was -- I think in terms of the inventories specifically, we did see a replenishment of inventory.\nSteven Cahillane: Trade inventory.\nAmit Banati: Of trade inventory. But from an overall standpoint, right, I think the leverage was driven by the increased production in the quarter.\nOperator: Next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Impressive results this quarter, congratulations to you and your organization. The North American cereal business was especially impressive. But as we look at consumption, it looks like the demand is waning despite the breakfast occasion being one of the slowest to recover in the away-from-home market. I was hoping you could sort of opine on why you think we're seeing the cereal business fade? Or at least consumption levels fade faster than most other at-home categories?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Thanks for the question, Jason. What I'd say about cereal consumption, it's moved around. It's been pretty choppy. And if you look at the latest syndicated data, it actually looks like it's coming back now. And so it's been choppier, and I think some of that might be stocking up. We do see trips down and baskets up, so people load up their pantry, but they are going through it.  And so I think we're just going to have to continue to take a wait-and-see approach because all of our panel research also suggests that consumption remains very strong and very robust. And we like our performance in that. And we're investing quite substantially in the back half of the year in a back-to-school program. You can see the Mission Tiger, which has been on air, which has been very successful in really gaining steam. So it's one to watch, obviously, but we're pretty confident that the at-home consumption is going to remain elevated. And we're assuming a deceleration, obviously, from the height of it as people become more mobile and things do return back to normal, but we're still seeing good overall consumption, although choppy.\nJason English: That's helpful. Good context. In light of that, why do you expect margin mix to not be a tailwind in the back half of the year? What's going to change to make that go net neutral or see the benefits fade?\nAmit Banati: Yes. So I think, Jason, in the second, mix was favorable in the quarter, like I said, as we saw growth move from snacks towards RTEC and noodles. I think as we look at the second half, we expect that to moderate as we get back to more normal consumption levels. So that's the assumption. That's the planning assumption, underlying gross margin for the second half.\nOperator: The next question is from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: Just two questions related to the second half. First, I guess as you're thinking about or you're planning for an increase in marketing expenses in the back half and especially in the third quarter. Can you just talk about how back-to-school is shaping up? And what changes you may be making to your sort of back-to-school promotions and merchandising? And then maybe just related -- or second, would be just on Pringles in Europe. I know that there's a change in merchandising there because you've done a lot relative to soccer in recent years. So can you just update us there in terms of what your changed plans are, I guess, for Pringles in Europe in the third quarter?\nSteven Cahillane: Sure. Thanks for the question, Bryan. First, with respect to the back-to-school program and how we're thinking about the second half, I'd start by actually giving you some -- we didn't say it, but our actual advertising spend in the first half was still up year-over-year.  But obviously, in-store merchandising and promotions and consumer promotions affected by COVID in the first half. As we think about the back half, we were very purposeful in back-to-school, for example, in thinking about what the environment might be. Will kids be actually going back to brick-and-mortar? Will they be doing a hybrid? Will they be staying at home? So we believe our program works in any environment, and it's tied to literature and books and getting books into kids' hands tied to the purchase of our cereals. And so we think it's very good. We think it's very strong. And we think it's very versatile depending on what the environment may end up being. And so the team has worked very hard on it, and I think we've got a solid, solid program. With respect to Pringles, Pringles, obviously, in the first half, we had to lap the cancellation of the Euro Cup, which was huge. And we put a lot of effort into building that program to lap what it had been 2 years of exceptional performance in Pringles over the course of the summertime.  And now as we think about Q3 and Q4, we're taking the same type of approach. How do we put together programs around gaming, how do we put together programs that drive more in-store execution. We have our sales force back in store. So we have a lot more merchandising happening. And the fact that we were able to get to flat on Pringles in the first half of the year, lapping exceptional 2-year performances without the Euro Cup, I think, is a testament to the versatility and the agility of the team, and we expect that to continue in the second half. But it will be -- it will continue to be a challenge.\nOperator: The next question is from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies.\nRobert Dickerson: Just had a quick question on your comment that you think maybe kind of consumption, let's say, demand, food-at-home, however, we want to define it in Q4 starts to normalize. Obviously, you have a lot of scenarios, right, I'm sure you put in place. But maybe if you could just provide a little bit more color as to what, in this case, what normalized means exactly? And then, I guess, number two, just kind of how you think broadly about food-at-home consumption versus what you were seeing in kind of on-the-go, just given you do have part of your portfolio in on-the-go and then foodservice, right?  And I just asked because if food-at-home consumption comes down a bit, maybe on-the-go improves a little bit, maybe foodservice recovery is slow but still improves. So just kind of holistically, what does normalization mean? And how are the moving parts impact that?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Thanks, Rob. It's obviously an important question, and it's an unknowable, right? And we all have our hunches about what might happen, but it's an unknowable what happens with this virus. We expect that right now, we're still seeing at-home consumption obviously elevated. But as we think about planning and giving guidance for the rest of the year, the best that we felt we could do is take a planning stance that says it will decelerate. And in quarter 4, it will get back to a more normalized world. So that you can understand and you can make your own judgments about, do you think that's conservative? Do you think that's straight down the middle of the fairway? It's an unknowable, but it is our planning stance. Same thing for travel and lodging and away-from-home, we expect that that will continue to face pressure. Travel and lodging, probably more so than convenience, which we're seeing come back. We are seeing mobility grow but it's choppy. Obviously, then you have the virus wreaking havoc in many states in the southern part of the United States and that goes backwards. And so from a planning stance, that's why we tried to be as transparent as possible and tell you exactly what we're thinking. And then you can draw your conclusions as to exactly how you think that may change, particularly in quarter 4 and beyond.\nRobert Dickerson: Okay. Fair enough. And then just quickly, just in terms of the back half investments, let's say, you're not the only food company that's speaking to back half investments. Again, kind of broadly speaking is your feel that as a lot of companies have kind of experienced this increased tussled penetration lift that as we get through the back half generally, right, the kind of the brand investment will be up across all channels within food. And then maybe as we even think to 2021, those levels can remain high because everybody is essentially trying to keep that penetration as sticky as possible. That's it.\nSteven Cahillane: Yes, Rob, I think that's right. If you think about just the environment that we're in, this elevated demand has made these categories more attractive than they've been in many, many years. Obviously, that a lot of that is driven by COVID. But it does drive reappraisal. It does drive increased penetration. Our penetration is up and our usage is up. And so these are big opportunities for us to continue to connect our brands with consumers in an environment of elevated demand, making as much of that stick as possible.  And so our whole goal with this investment in the second half is again, to fully spend what we plan to spend, but to come out of this a much stronger company, and we are very confident that we're going to be able to do that. Because we've got good brand plans. We're investing in organic growth opportunities that are more attractive than they have been in many, many years.  And so it's a crisis, obviously, but it's an opportunity for us to strengthen our brands, to make better connections with consumers, to build retailer programs that work for the retailers, that work for us, that work for consumers and drive stickiness and drive brand loyalty and, therefore, come out of this crisis and into next year in a much stronger position than when we entered it.\nOperator: Next question is from David Driscoll with DD Research.\nDavid Driscoll: I wanted to ask a little bit about this advertising and brand-building shift into the second half. Steve, what do you say to the question or concern from investors that moving a sizable amount of brand building will be less efficient in just 6 months versus had it been able to spend -- been able to be spent over a full 12 months?  Do you worry about the effectiveness of all of the spending that you're moving into the second half? And if not, why? Maybe give us a little bit of inside color here on why this spending is going to be highly effective and maybe on which brands? Is there some things that we all should be looking for to understand the good work that your team is doing?\nSteven Cahillane: Great. Thanks, Dave. Good question. And we are very confident that we're going to have terrific ROIs on our brand spend. And the return on investment calculations will be very important as we plan out, and we'll guide exactly where we're spending. But it's also for the long-term, to build the long-term equities and continue to improve awareness, trial, and overall brand health of our brands. The other thing I would tell you is, and this is continuing, with people far less mobile and staying at home, our ability to connect with them continues to be very strong, maybe not as strong as April and May when the lockdowns were very severe, but people are less mobile, they're at home, and we know how to connect with them.  And that's what it's going to be about. So it's digital, it's social, it's traditional, all guided by ROIs and with very attractive categories. Look across our portfolio, cereal doing very well, frozen, breakfast, frozen veggie doing very well. Incogmeato, we've consolidated that launch into the back half of the year. That will be fully supported. And so there's a lot of really exciting things that we're spending our money against and that we're very excited about. But we'll be guided by the right ROIs and the long-term nature of building equities for our brands.\nDavid Driscoll: One follow-up for me is, you mentioned that you have this expectation that everything moderates, and that's your planning expectation. Is there any concern that if you're wrong, if there's upside to this, will you have the capacity? Will you have the inventories to service elevated demand? So if you can see what I'm getting at, I'm just worried that if you tell the manufacturing team to only plan for a certain scenario of moderation, if it comes out better, maybe you don't actually have the inventories to meet retailer demand.\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. So I'd start by saying what our supply chain has done in the first half of this year has been extraordinary. And it starts with a commitment to keeping people safe to making sure that we've got the right procedures and processes in place. And none of that has changed. Our plans continue to run at a very high level even now. So we will do our best to stay agile to forecast as best as we possibly can and to make sure that we can execute against any potential upside, and so that's our planning stance. Certainly, we're working on how can we make it better. We're working on rebuilding inventories. Our service levels are still not where they were pre-COVID. They're certainly much better and continue to improve.  But the supply chain continues to really show exemplary performance and their ability to be agile and meet unexpected demand has proven itself. And if necessary, I think we've got a lot of confidence that they'll be able to meet whatever unforeseen future is in front of us.\nAmit Banati: Operator, I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: And that question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein.\nAlexia Howard: Just a couple of questions from me. As you think about the uses of cash, given the big surge in free cash flow that you've got, where are you likely to channel that? And is it possible that you might target acquisitions? Or will you return to shareholders? That's my first question. And then second one actually relates to pricing. As I look in your press release, the pricing in North America and in Europe, particularly was down a price/mix. So down marginally, I think, 1 and a bit percent in North America, but down actually more profoundly, I think, minus 4.5% [Technical Difficulty]. And yet, when we look at the Nielsen data, the pricing is upon shelf, and I was just wondering if you can just speak to what the dynamics are there.\nAmit Banati: All right. So I think just from a cash standpoint, I think we're looking to invest the cash, as Steve talked in brand building, increased CapEx. I think debt reduction continues to be a priority, so we're very focused on that as we've said throughout the course of this year.  So that will continue to remain the priority in the second half as well. And we're making good progress on that, as you saw in the prepared remarks. I think from a price/mix standpoint, pricing was actually positive in the quarter. I think what you're seeing is the mix, and it goes back to the category mix. We've seen growth move away from snacks towards RTEC and noodles. And on the price/mix line, that's negative. But on the gross margin line, that's actually a positive. So really, that's what's driving the price mix.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to John Renwick for any closing remarks.\nJohn Renwick: Well, thank you. We are at the 10:30 point here. If you did not get to ask a question, I apologize, but I'm around all day. And hope you all have a good day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steven Cahillane",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. These are certainly unusual and troubling times. The pandemic drags on with cases rising again in many states and countries that had just begun to reopen. And recent events around racial injustices have only added to an environment that is both uncertain and worrisome. It goes without saying that these crises have touched us all in some way, and our hearts go out to individuals and families that have been directly affected, and we certainly hope you and your families and friends are staying safe. As a company with heart and soul, it has been very important for us to maintain ongoing communication with our stakeholders about what we are doing to keep each other safe.  How we continue to supply our markets with food and how we are giving back to our communities. We've also worked to increase our open dialogue about diversity and inclusion, which we deem to be inherent in our company's values. This is included stepped-up actions like incremental donations to the NAACP, town halls, and testimonials by employees, professors, and authors, and we will continue to do so.  So we are certainly operating in unprecedented times. And from our employees on the front lines, in our plants and distribution centers and now back in stores, to our employees working from their homes, this organization has come together and rallied to the occasion like nothing I've ever seen before. From a business perspective, turning to Slide 5, we're managing well through the crisis. Our 1 priority, of course, has been keeping our employees and their families safe as best as we can. We've talked previously about the investments and process changes we have made, and we will remain vigilant to protect our people. We've told you that we feel we have an incredible responsibility in supplying food during this time. I'm happy to report that we've experienced no major supply disruptions and managed to increase our production and keep up our service levels in spite of higher-than-expected demand in many markets. We continue to aid our communities through volunteer hours and through what is now nearly $15 million in cash and food donations that we've made since this crisis began. These are our priorities during the crisis, and we are executing well against them. Turning to Slide 6. It was in the usual quarter, to say the least. In addition to executing against our crisis priorities, we again delivered exceptional results in the second quarter, even amidst a very uncertain environment and new unusual ways of working. Our net sales came in much higher than expected. We'd assume that at-home consumption growth would decelerate meaningfully during the second quarter, but with prolonged prices, it held up higher and for longer than we had forecast. And in some of our categories, retailers were able to catch up to demand and rebuild inventory. Meanwhile, declines in away-from-home channels persisted, and our emerging markets did not slow down as much as we had expected given COVID disruptions and recessionary conditions.  We also generated higher-than-expected operating profit. The higher-than-projected volume ran through our well-utilized plants, driving strong operating leverage. This more than offset significant incremental COVID-related costs in the quarter, mainly around safety, employee benefits, temporary labor, and logistics. The net of this was an unusually large increase in gross profit. Our operating profit also received a temporary boost from the deferral of various investments. We again shifted brand building investments in the second half, particularly investment in activities that we tied to canceled or delayed sporting events, movie releases, and innovation launches. We also shifted some overhead and capital investment to the second half. As a result, we have seen an even larger shift of the year's operating profit into the first half. It's important to recognize that we also executed well, and there are clear signs that our underlying business is in good shape.  For instance, we continue to increase household penetration aided by our ability to get food into the market and to adjust our brand communication. There is trial, repeat, and reappraisal that can benefit us long after the crisis finally passes.  All other signs of execution include our improved category share performance, including some brands that we've been revitalizing through fresh brand messaging. And our supply chain is operating well, gradually improving our service levels amidst unusually challenging circumstances. All of these contributed to an outsized financial delivery in Q2. So let's discuss what this means for our full year, turning to Slide 7. We recognize that many companies have refrained from giving guidance in this uncertain environment, and we can understand why. There are a number of variables that are extremely uncertain right now. So today, we're going to offer you our planning stance for the second half and how we are approaching some of these variables, and we are raising our full year guidance to reflect our over-delivery in the first half. From a net sales standpoint, our increased full year outlook reflects the strong growth we delivered in the first half as well as a slightly improved top-line outlook for the second half. We won't get more aggressive than that because too many variables are simply too uncertain. From a profit and earnings standpoint, we do know that our second half profit will be weighted down by investment. Most of this increased second half investment is simply shifted from the first and second quarters, the result of focusing on supply and postponing promotional activity tied to canceled events. Specifically, in the second half, we plan to return to full commercial programming and to completely invest our full year brand building budget.  Again, there are many unique assumptions that we have to make in formulating an outlook right now. The length and severity of the COVID crisis and related economic recession is not knowable. But Amit will walk you through our key planning assumptions in a moment. Suffice it to say, we feel very good about having a front-weighted profit delivery this year and a strengthened commercial plan for the second half. So with that, let me turn it over to Amit, who will take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail. Thanks, Amit. I'll now do our normal walk through the regions. Even keeping in mind the uniqueness of the current environment, and therefore, the timing related benefits to sales and operating profit, we saw good underlying execution and performance in all of our regions and all 4 of the global category groups. Let's begin with North America in Slide 17. We've had a strong quarter in first half of 2020 as the pandemic has lifted demand for at-home consumption. The result was organic net sales growth of 11% in quarter two, which turned out to be even higher than our 6% growth in quarter 1. This elevated consumption was most pronounced in meal-oriented categories, which for us is cereal, frozen breakfast, and frozen veggie foods. Reversing what happened in quarter 1, shipment growth in quarter two to retail channels exceeded consumption growth, mainly in cereal, suggesting replenishment of retailers' inventory. We were also rebuilding our own inventory during quarter two, helping us to improve our service levels and adding to an unusually large margin benefit from operating leverage in the quarter. This, too, has a timing element to it. Not surprisingly, our away-from-home business declined sharply in quarter two, though we managed it well. We've mitigated sales declines in the schools channel by shifting toward emergency feeding programs and our declines in convenience stores have begun to moderate. That said, our sales in the restaurants remain down sharply, and we are seeing our sharpest declines in vending and travel and lodging, with the latter likely to remain soft for some time. In Canada, we recorded double-digit organic net sales growth, led by elevated consumption growth in cereal and frozen breakfast and veggie foods as well as our expansion of Cheez-It. Importantly, we gained share in 4 of our 6 main categories there. North America's profit growth was notably strong in quarter two, and this reflects the unusually high operating leverage and a shift of investment to the second half. Let's take a look at each of our 3 major category groupings in North America, starting with our largest, snacks, on Slide 18. This is the business affected by the divestiture. But on an organic basis, it had another good quarter with net sales increasing 6% year-on-year. Our crackers consumption in the U.S. increased by almost 9% in quarter two, gaining share of the category.  Cheez-It continue to grow at a double-digit rate, and we also saw share gains by our Club and Cars brands reflecting their orientation toward at-home occasions as a company man crackers. In salty snacks, Pringles grew consumption by almost 12%, modestly trailing the category because of declines in immediate consumption pack formats. The brand's core four flavors collectively grew in line with the category. In portable wholesome snacks, we've gained share behind double-digit growth in Pop-Tarts and continued growth in Rice Krispies Treats. These brands are more than offsetting softness in the overall category, which has been declining because of the on-the-go nature of so many of its products. For us, this has included RXBAR. As we move to the second half, we expect to see moderating at-home consumption growth against tougher year-ago comparisons, but with the resumption of commercial programming and investment. Now let's turn to North America cereal and Slide 19. The U.S. and Canadian cereal categories continued to see elevated levels of consumption during quarter two. And in both markets, our quarter two net sales got further lift from replenishing retailer inventories. In the United States, our cereal consumption was up almost 16% year-on-year, outpacing the category. Importantly, we are gaining share not only behind taste/fun brands like Froot Loops but also behind health and wellness-oriented brands that we set out to revitalize this year through refreshed messaging and media. Special K gained share in quarter two as is Mini-Wheats and Raisin Bran. We are also excited about the consumer trial and rediscovery we are seeing from new and lapsed users in cereal. Household penetration continued to rise sequentially and year-over-year in quarter two, and we are tailoring our messaging and media to reaching out to these consumers. We're not only growing consumption faster than the category but we're also increasing household penetration faster than the category. As we enter the second half, we've returned to normal merchandising activity. Not only versus the first half when investment was delayed but also against last year when we were only just coming out of the pack-sized harmonization during the year ago third quarter. We're certainly encouraged by the momentum we're building in our cereal business. Now let's turn to our North America frozen foods Business and Slide 20. These categories saw very elevated at-home demand continue in quarter two, driving very strong net sales growth. In what we call the frozen from the griddle category, our Eggo brand posted consumption growth of about 26% during the quarter, gaining substantial share, while our Kashi brand grew about 19%. We outpaced each of the category's 3 product segments: waffles, pancakes, and french toast, aided by strong innovation and renovation we have done over the past year. In frozen veggie foods, our Morningstar Farms brand grew consumption by more than 31% in the quarter, failing to keep up with the category only because we ran up against our capacity in the quarter. Both of these categories are seeing increased household penetration.  So even as at-home demand inevitably decelerates, we see an opportunity to increase our communication to take advantage of the increased household penetration. Indeed, in the second half, we will be investing in this communication as well as in the launch of Incogmeato. You'll recall that this is the refrigerated sub-line of our Morningstar Farms brand, whose launch was deferred to the second half because of retailer resets getting delayed because of the crisis.  So another big quarter for Kellogg North America. And even though much of its first half profit growth will reverse in quarter three and quarter 4 when we see growth rates moderate and our investments get executed, there's no doubt that our business in North America will emerge from 2020 much stronger. Now let's discuss our international businesses, starting with Europe on Slide 21. Europe had another solid quarter. Specifically, we realized elevated cereal consumption growth across all of our key markets in Europe as shown on the slide. And equally importantly, we've gained share in each of our top 5 cereal markets namely the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. Our Krave brand, known as Tresor in some markets, is up 25% year-to-date and has become the 1 cereal brand in Europe.  Special K, the 3 cereal brand in Europe, has kept up with the category so far this year, attributed to our packaging and messaging overhauls. Coco Pops, another brand in Europe's top 5 also outpaced the category. So between at-home demand rising during the pandemic and strong execution and share gains by our team, our cereal net sales grew at a double-digit rate in quarter two. Our net sales in snacks, however, declined in the quarter as expected. You'll recall that with the cancellation of the Euro Cup soccer tournament, we had to cancel a 360-degree marketing program that was a strong plan to grow Pringles on top of 2 years of exceptional summer programs.  Due to the agility and creativity of our brand team, we were able to move to a combination of smaller programs, which successfully held Europe's Pringles sales flat year-on-year. Our only soft spot in the quarter was portable wholesome snacks, whose on-the-go orientation has pulled down the entire category and our share remained relatively stable. As we focused on supplying the market with food, we did defer more of Kellogg Europe's overall brand investment to the second half, which effectively shifted profit into the first half and out of the second half. We're very pleased with how we are executing in Europe. Let's turn to Latin America and Slide 22. Amidst a growing COVID crisis and an uncertain economic environment, our Latin American business is performing well. Net sales in the quarter grew 14% on an organic basis during quarter two, which was much more than we expected for two reasons. First, at home demand growth actually accelerated in this region as the COVID outbreak worsened.  This was especially the case for meal-oriented categories in the modern trade channels. For us, this had a major effect on cereal, and we saw double-digit consumption growth in key cereal markets across the region during quarter two. And second, retailers proceeded with their summer promotions as normal in June, whereas we had anticipated some execution delays given COVID limitations. The result was higher-than-expected cereal net sales which more than offset impacts of recessionary economic environment and general softness in snacking categories, particularly in high-frequency stores or mom-and-pop's and on-the-go channels. Our snacking categories have not seen a lift in demand, particularly in on-the-go-oriented categories like wholesome snacks, and particularly in markets like Brazil where high-frequency stores predominate. The good news is that Pringles continued to grow consumption and gain share in key markets like Mexico and Brazil. With COVID cases on the rise and an economy that is clearly soft, we remain cautious in our outlook for Latin America's second half, particularly with new labeling restrictions in Mexico. But there is no question that our team is managing well through a difficult environment. And finally, we'll discuss EMEA, shown on Slide 23. EMEA also exceeded expectations in the second quarter. Cereal sales remained strong, sustaining a mid-single-digit growth rate as at-home consumption remained elevated in the more developed markets of the region. We also performed well within these cereal markets. In Australia and South Africa, for instance, our strong double-digit consumption growth rates were enough to gain multiple points of share in those growing cereal categories. The biggest positive surprise in the quarter was Multipro, the distributor portion of our rapidly growing business in West Africa.  COVID lockdowns and a softening economy did indeed slow growth from Multipro, but certainly not as much as we anticipated. Where we did see softness, as expected, was in snacks in the Middle East and other emerging markets like India, related to COVID disruption and slowing economies. Nevertheless, despite challenging macro environment, we still managed to deliver good top-line growth in this region in quarter two, and our profit growth was augmented further by delays in brand investment to the second half.  We see quarter 2's top-line growth remaining at a decelerated pace in the second half, given the macro environment, but we like how we are managing through the crisis overall in EMEA. So allow me to summarize with Slide 25. The company continues to execute well amidst the crisis. It hasn't been easy. It has required courage and flexibility in the part of our employees, and it has required considerable incremental costs in the form of safety and cleaning, temporary labor, additional freight, and bonuses for our deserving frontline employees, and its working. We're keeping our employees safe. We're supplying food to customers and consumers. We're giving back to the community. And we're enhancing our financial flexibility. Meanwhile, we're very grateful for our partnerships with our suppliers, and our retail customers during these challenging times. It is this execution that has enabled us to deliver even better results than we had anticipated in both quarter 1 and quarter two and both in market and our financial results.  This has important implications. We are able to raise our financial forecast for the year, delivering more net sales, more operating profit, more earnings per share, and more cash flow than we had planned. And yet, at the same time, we are also able to reinvest back in the business during the second half. This means investing to revitalize more of the brands in our portfolio and reaching out to new and lapsed users who have rediscovered our foods during the crisis. It means we can invest more in capabilities that will give us a leg up in the marketplace, such as data and analytics, digital and e-commerce, and packaging. And in the end, it means we can finish 2020 with both better-than-expected financial performance and come out a stronger company. It means we can improve our financial flexibility in a time of great uncertainty, and it only solidifies our path towards balanced and consistent growth in sales, profit, and cash flow over time. Before we close, I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our employees, their bravery, dedication, and hard work are exemplary. And their engagement during this time of crisis has been inspiring. It just reaffirms that Kellogg has a truly special culture. And with that, we'll open it up for your questions. Yes. Thanks, Chris. I'll start, and then I think Amit will build on it. First, obviously, we had monumental changes in the first half. If you think about, at the very beginning, the March Madness, obviously being canceled, NBA on and on, everything just got canceled. So that led us to making big shifts in marketing and investment, which we plan on, as we said in the prepared remarks, to fully invest in the second half. Order of magnitude, we're talking about being as much as $60 million, 6-0 in shift from the first half into the second half, much of that advertising and promotion. And a lot of it will be weighted towards quarter three, which we're obviously in right now. You want to talk about maybe, look at the operating leverage, Amit? Trade inventory. Yes. Thanks for the question, Jason. What I'd say about cereal consumption, it's moved around. It's been pretty choppy. And if you look at the latest syndicated data, it actually looks like it's coming back now. And so it's been choppier, and I think some of that might be stocking up. We do see trips down and baskets up, so people load up their pantry, but they are going through it.  And so I think we're just going to have to continue to take a wait-and-see approach because all of our panel research also suggests that consumption remains very strong and very robust. And we like our performance in that. And we're investing quite substantially in the back half of the year in a back-to-school program. You can see the Mission Tiger, which has been on air, which has been very successful in really gaining steam. So it's one to watch, obviously, but we're pretty confident that the at-home consumption is going to remain elevated. And we're assuming a deceleration, obviously, from the height of it as people become more mobile and things do return back to normal, but we're still seeing good overall consumption, although choppy. Sure. Thanks for the question, Bryan. First, with respect to the back-to-school program and how we're thinking about the second half, I'd start by actually giving you some -- we didn't say it, but our actual advertising spend in the first half was still up year-over-year.  But obviously, in-store merchandising and promotions and consumer promotions affected by COVID in the first half. As we think about the back half, we were very purposeful in back-to-school, for example, in thinking about what the environment might be. Will kids be actually going back to brick-and-mortar? Will they be doing a hybrid? Will they be staying at home? So we believe our program works in any environment, and it's tied to literature and books and getting books into kids' hands tied to the purchase of our cereals. And so we think it's very good. We think it's very strong. And we think it's very versatile depending on what the environment may end up being. And so the team has worked very hard on it, and I think we've got a solid, solid program. With respect to Pringles, Pringles, obviously, in the first half, we had to lap the cancellation of the Euro Cup, which was huge. And we put a lot of effort into building that program to lap what it had been 2 years of exceptional performance in Pringles over the course of the summertime.  And now as we think about Q3 and Q4, we're taking the same type of approach. How do we put together programs around gaming, how do we put together programs that drive more in-store execution. We have our sales force back in store. So we have a lot more merchandising happening. And the fact that we were able to get to flat on Pringles in the first half of the year, lapping exceptional 2-year performances without the Euro Cup, I think, is a testament to the versatility and the agility of the team, and we expect that to continue in the second half. But it will be -- it will continue to be a challenge. Yes. Thanks, Rob. It's obviously an important question, and it's an unknowable, right? And we all have our hunches about what might happen, but it's an unknowable what happens with this virus. We expect that right now, we're still seeing at-home consumption obviously elevated. But as we think about planning and giving guidance for the rest of the year, the best that we felt we could do is take a planning stance that says it will decelerate. And in quarter 4, it will get back to a more normalized world. So that you can understand and you can make your own judgments about, do you think that's conservative? Do you think that's straight down the middle of the fairway? It's an unknowable, but it is our planning stance. Same thing for travel and lodging and away-from-home, we expect that that will continue to face pressure. Travel and lodging, probably more so than convenience, which we're seeing come back. We are seeing mobility grow but it's choppy. Obviously, then you have the virus wreaking havoc in many states in the southern part of the United States and that goes backwards. And so from a planning stance, that's why we tried to be as transparent as possible and tell you exactly what we're thinking. And then you can draw your conclusions as to exactly how you think that may change, particularly in quarter 4 and beyond. Yes, Rob, I think that's right. If you think about just the environment that we're in, this elevated demand has made these categories more attractive than they've been in many, many years. Obviously, that a lot of that is driven by COVID. But it does drive reappraisal. It does drive increased penetration. Our penetration is up and our usage is up. And so these are big opportunities for us to continue to connect our brands with consumers in an environment of elevated demand, making as much of that stick as possible.  And so our whole goal with this investment in the second half is again, to fully spend what we plan to spend, but to come out of this a much stronger company, and we are very confident that we're going to be able to do that. Because we've got good brand plans. We're investing in organic growth opportunities that are more attractive than they have been in many, many years.  And so it's a crisis, obviously, but it's an opportunity for us to strengthen our brands, to make better connections with consumers, to build retailer programs that work for the retailers, that work for us, that work for consumers and drive stickiness and drive brand loyalty and, therefore, come out of this crisis and into next year in a much stronger position than when we entered it. Great. Thanks, Dave. Good question. And we are very confident that we're going to have terrific ROIs on our brand spend. And the return on investment calculations will be very important as we plan out, and we'll guide exactly where we're spending. But it's also for the long-term, to build the long-term equities and continue to improve awareness, trial, and overall brand health of our brands. The other thing I would tell you is, and this is continuing, with people far less mobile and staying at home, our ability to connect with them continues to be very strong, maybe not as strong as April and May when the lockdowns were very severe, but people are less mobile, they're at home, and we know how to connect with them.  And that's what it's going to be about. So it's digital, it's social, it's traditional, all guided by ROIs and with very attractive categories. Look across our portfolio, cereal doing very well, frozen, breakfast, frozen veggie doing very well. Incogmeato, we've consolidated that launch into the back half of the year. That will be fully supported. And so there's a lot of really exciting things that we're spending our money against and that we're very excited about. But we'll be guided by the right ROIs and the long-term nature of building equities for our brands. Yes. So I'd start by saying what our supply chain has done in the first half of this year has been extraordinary. And it starts with a commitment to keeping people safe to making sure that we've got the right procedures and processes in place. And none of that has changed. Our plans continue to run at a very high level even now. So we will do our best to stay agile to forecast as best as we possibly can and to make sure that we can execute against any potential upside, and so that's our planning stance. Certainly, we're working on how can we make it better. We're working on rebuilding inventories. Our service levels are still not where they were pre-COVID. They're certainly much better and continue to improve.  But the supply chain continues to really show exemplary performance and their ability to be agile and meet unexpected demand has proven itself. And if necessary, I think we've got a lot of confidence that they'll be able to meet whatever unforeseen future is in front of us."

            "name": "Amit Banati",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with Slide 9 and a reminder of our financial approach during the crisis. Employee safety is the top priority, and we will continue to invest in this area in safety supplies, temperature checks, and incremental cleaning protocols as well as information technology to facilitate working remotely. To supply the market with food, we've continued to focus production on priority SKUs, utilize temporary labor where necessary, and reward our frontline workers with bonuses and benefits. We've also invested in logistics to get food to our customers as quickly as possible. We've continued to ensure financial flexibility which is particularly important in this environment of economic recession and volatile financial markets.  Our cash flow has been very strong, enabling us to carry higher-than-usual cash balances and shows strong liquidity and reduce debt leverage. And we've remained committed to investing in the future. As Steve mentioned, the crisis led us to defer some commercial activity and investments to the second half, and we plan to execute not only those shifted investments but also incremental investments that can be funded by our strong first half earnings and cash flow. So this is the context in which we view our financial results and outlook. Slide 10 summarizes our results for the second quarter and first half. As Steve mentioned, these strong results reflect good execution in an unprecedented environment. There really were 2 big factors that exceeded our expectations for the quarter. First, at-home consumption in developed markets did decelerate through the quarter, but not nearly as quickly as we had anticipated back in April, particularly as we improved our share performance in key markets and categories.  And second, our emerging markets did slow amidst lockdowns and economic slowdowns, but we managed through them well and they did not slow by as much as we had expected. From a margin perspective, the better-than-expected volume and very strong supply chain execution resulted in greater operating leverage than expected, more than offsetting higher incremental COVID costs, which amounted to more than $20 million in quarter two, a sizable increase from quarter 1. We also found ourselves having to delay more brand investment into the second half than previously anticipated, acting with agility to shift plans due to postponed events and supply constraints. These were the key underlying drivers in the quarter. On top of that, of course, was the mechanical impact of last year's divestiture. The absence of those businesses' results negatively impacted organic net sales by approximately 6% in quarter two and about 8% year-to-date. Its negative impact on adjusted basis operating profit was more than 8% in quarter two and 10% year-to-date. We lapped the divestiture this week. So we'll have only 1 month impact in quarter three. Below operating profit, we continue to prioritize debt reduction, making no share buybacks in the quarter and reducing our interest expense on lower net debt. Other income benefited from changes to certain pension funds in the quarter, though this was offset by a higher-than-projected effective tax rate. The result of all of these is in earnings per share and cash flow that again came in ahead of pace. Taking into a little more detail, let's look at net sales growth on Slide 11. Our organic basis net sales growth was 9% year-on-year in the quarter, slightly higher than our first quarter growth. This organic growth was again driven by volume, reflecting the pandemic-related demand, which end up higher and for longer than expected.  Our price/mix was modestly negative in the quarter, owing to category and country mix. Once again, our organic net sales growth was across all 4 regions and across all 4 global category groups: snacks, cereals, frozen foods and noodles, and other.  The divestiture impact in quarter two reflects the absence of those businesses. In quarter three, we'll have only 1 month of impact translating into approximately negative 2% of net sales. Currency was adverse in quarter two, owing to the dollar strengthening against key currencies back in March. Now let's turn to profit margins on Slide 12. As we've discussed previously, our goal this year was to finish 2020 at a stable level year-on-year on gross profit margin. Obviously, the surge in at-home demand and the resultant operating leverage has moved this plan from being a gradual improvement across the year to being a front-weighted plan. During quarter two, we saw a substantial year-on-year increase in gross margin, reflecting not only operating leverage from higher volume but also a moderation of what had been a meaningfully negative margin mix trend towards emerging markets. In the pandemic-affected second quarter, emerging markets actually grew less than developed markets. In a moment, I'll discuss why we view this large quarter two gain as temporary. But this front-weighted performance does offer increased confidence in our full year outlook for gross profit margin. At the operating profit margin, the improvement was also substantial in quarter two and also mostly timing related. As we've discussed previously, a good portion of our brand-building investment had to be shifted to the second half, particularly investment that was tied to external events or innovation launches that have been postponed. We are repurposing that investment into brand activities in the second half. Let's discuss cash flow and capital structure on Slide 13. Our cash flow continued to be strong in quarter two, up significantly year-on-year. This brings our year-to-date cash flow to more than $750 million, our strongest first half performance in years, even despite the absence of businesses we divested last July. Some of this is timing. Our earnings are front half-weighted this year with significant investment delayed to the second half. And as we did not want to disrupt our supply chain during the first half, our capital expenditure is weighted to the second half as well.  However, this strong year-on-year performance also reflects continued strong working capital management and reduced cash outlays related to restructurings. The next chart on the slide shows our net debt position. A combination of last year's divestiture proceeds and strong year-to-date cash flow have enabled us to pay down debt year-on-year and carry higher-than-usual cash balances around the world. In fact, at quarter end, our cash position was again over $1 billion. Our bond offering in May was very successful, indicating confidence in our balance sheet and cash flow and resulting in low interest rates. Our liquidity is excellent. In addition to our high cash balances, we retain access to commercial paper, and we have $2.5 billion of unused backup facilities. We're taking a proactive approach to financial flexibility in an uncertain operating environment, and we feel good about our liquidity and balance sheet going into the second half. Let's now discuss our rest of year outlook, starting with Slide 14. Obviously, this is a time of tremendous uncertainty and myriad variables can yield a wide range of outcomes. We want to give you visibility into the assumptions around which we are planning for the second half, specifically related to the pandemic and our investment plans. First, we plan for net sales growth to slow in the second half. We assume that at-home demand in developed markets continue to decelerate week-to-week through quarter three. Our outlook still considers the likelihood of prolonged softness in our away-from-home channels, including channels like travel and lodging that may take longer to stabilize and recover. And we assume that our emerging markets businesses will continue to feel the impact of COVID disruption and economic recession in the second half. Next, we view much of our outsized Q2 improvement in gross profit margin to be temporary. As we enter the second half, we lap the divestiture. So that particular year-on-year benefit obviously goes away. We also assume that we'll have less operating leverage in the second half as volume slows. And we'll have some plant-related changeovers as we resume production of paused SKUs. We'll sustain much of the direct COVID costs, particularly around safety and cleaning, and we will have less productivity savings this year due to delays in capital investments during the crisis. The result is year-on-year pressure on gross margin in the second half. And finally, we will execute a substantial year-on-year increase in investment in brands and capabilities. There is principally the advertising and promotion investment that shifted out of the first half and into the second half. And on top of that, there is also some incremental investment. In addition, there is incremental overhead and capital that reflects our desire to invest behind capabilities. Simply put, we are taking the profit upside we realized in the first half and putting it to good use: investment for future growth in categories that just got more exciting. So this is how we are viewing the crisis from a financial perspective in the second half. Again, as I'm sure you can appreciate, it's hard to say how the crisis will play out. But these are the assumptions we are planning around at this time. Now let's put it all together and look at our full year guidance shown on Slide 15. As Steve mentioned, we are raising our guidance for the year. Based on our second half planning assumptions, we now expect to finish 2020 with organic net sales growth of around 5%. This implies a modest improvement to our previous growth forecast for the second half and a substantial increase to our full year guidance.  We now expect currency-neutral adjusted operating profit to decline by only about 1%, which is about 3 percentage points better than our previous guidance and still includes roughly 6 percentage points of negative impact from our divestiture. This improved profit picture reflects a sizable growth in the first half, partially offset by shifted and incremental investments coming into the second half.  This increase in investment will weigh down operating profit in quarter three, in particular. Our outlook for currency-neutral adjusted earnings per share also improves meaningfully to a year-on-year decline of only about 1%, despite a negative impact of about 5% from the divestiture. This raised EPS guidance is driven by the increased outlook for operating profit. Below operating profit, our other income line benefits from quarter 2's favorable pension changes, but this should be roughly offset by an increased tax rate, owing to some unfavorable tax items recognized in quarter two, which will put us closer to a 22.5% rate for the year. Cash flow is now forecast to be about $1 billion, the high end of our previous guidance range. This improvement reflects our raised earnings outlook, partially offset by increased capital expenditure as we invest for the future. As I said, this is our planning stance. Yes, there could be upside if at-home consumption remains more elevated than we have assumed. However, there could also be downside if emerging markets feel greater pressure from recessionary impacts or if we suffer unanticipated supply chain disruptions related to the pandemic.  We think this is an appropriate planning stance, and we are pleased to be able to raise guidance while also investing more for the future. And with that, let me turn it back to Steve for a review of each of our major businesses. Sure. So Chris, just on gross margin, obviously, we had a very strong gross margin performance in the quarter. I think if I were to kind of break down the drivers of that, the divestiture was about 60 basis points, which was just mechanical as it flowed through. We did have incremental costs related to COVID of around $22 million, so that was about a 50 basis points headwind during the quarter. Input costs were roughly neutral. So largely, the balance of the gross margin was driven really by two things: one, the operating leverage coming through, and also a positive margin mix. So as the growth was more pronounced and moved away from snacks towards RTEC and noodles that that created a positive margin mix for us in the quarter. I think as we look to the second half, we'd expect the margin mix to be neutral, and then obviously, with lower volume growth, the operating leverage would be lower in the second half. And overall, we remain confident of our guidance on a stable gross profit margin for the year. Well, I think it was -- I think in terms of the inventories specifically, we did see a replenishment of inventory. Of trade inventory. But from an overall standpoint, right, I think the leverage was driven by the increased production in the quarter. Yes. So I think, Jason, in the second, mix was favorable in the quarter, like I said, as we saw growth move from snacks towards RTEC and noodles. I think as we look at the second half, we expect that to moderate as we get back to more normal consumption levels. So that's the assumption. That's the planning assumption, underlying gross margin for the second half. Operator, I think we have time for one more question. All right. So I think just from a cash standpoint, I think we're looking to invest the cash, as Steve talked in brand building, increased CapEx. I think debt reduction continues to be a priority, so we're very focused on that as we've said throughout the course of this year.  So that will continue to remain the priority in the second half as well. And we're making good progress on that, as you saw in the prepared remarks. I think from a price/mix standpoint, pricing was actually positive in the quarter. I think what you're seeing is the mix, and it goes back to the category mix. We've seen growth move away from snacks towards RTEC and noodles. And on the price/mix line, that's negative. But on the gross margin line, that's actually a positive. So really, that's what's driving the price mix."

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Please limit yourself to one question during the Q&A session. Thank you. Please note this event is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for the Kellogg Company. Mr. Renwick, you may begin your conference call.\nJohn Renwick: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for a review of our first quarter results, as well as our outlook for 2020. I\u2019m joined this morning by Steve Cahillane, our Chairman and CEO; and Amit Banati, our Chief Financial Officer. Due to the pandemic and measures to stay safe, we are calling in from multiple locations and even time zones. So hopefully, technology will carry the day and we\u2019ll all hear each other clearly throughout the call. Slide #3 shows our forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware, certain statements made today, such as projections for Kellogg Company\u2019s future performance, are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to this third slide of the presentation, as well as to our public SEC filings. A replay of today\u2019s conference call will be available by phone through Thursday, May 7. The call will also be available via webcast, which can be archived for at least 90 days on the Investor page of kelloggcompany.com. As always, when referring to our results and outlook, unless otherwise noted, we will be referring to them on a currency-neutral basis for net sales and on a currency-neutral adjusted basis for operating profit and earnings per share. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve.\nSteven Cahillane: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Obviously, these are unprecedented times, and our hearts and thoughts go out to the families affected and lives disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, and I sincerely hope you and your families are staying healthy and safe. Today, we\u2019ll share with you what we\u2019re doing to keep our employees safe and the markets supplied with food and how we\u2019re giving back to the community. These are the priorities right now. Obviously, it has been nothing close to business as usual over the past few weeks and is not likely to be business as usual for sometime. That said, we\u2019re pleased with the direction our business was going prior to the crisis, and we\u2019re proud of the work we\u2019ve done to manage the business during crisis. Today, we\u2019ll discuss how the crisis has impacted our results and give you a sense of how we think the rest of the year could play out. And we\u2019ll reassure you that while managing through this crisis, we are also taking prudent steps to ensure stable and dependable performance now and in the future. So let\u2019s discuss our priorities during the crisis, starting with Slide #5. Our first priority, of course, is to keep our employees safe. We acted quickly to protect our employees, taking a global crisis management approach. We invested in incremental safety supplies, personal protection equipment, and cleaning protocols across our facilities. We took measures like temperature checks and social distancing protocols in our plants and distribution centers. We provided recognition bonuses, enhanced \u2013 and enhanced benefits like leave policies for our plant and distribution center employees. We implemented travel and meeting restrictions followed by work-from-home policies, investing in technology to make this possible. I meet daily with my leadership team to monitor, assess and make timely decisions, and we\u2019re having regular worldwide updates via video conferences with all employees. Safety will continue to be our highest priority. Our next priority has been to ensure we are supplying food to the marketplace, as captured on Slide #6. As a food manufacturer, we have a unique role and responsibility during this crisis. Our beloved foods and brands are sought by consumers worldwide, making it so important for us to find ways to get our products to them. Fortunately, governments have established that food is designated as an essential service and we \u2013 we\u2019re collaborating closely with them. As a result, since late February, we\u2019ve been able to run our plants at full capacity in most markets around the world, increasing production by focusing on key items. We are working closely with our retailers to get them what they need. We\u2019ve invested in additional warehouse space, redeployment of inventory and increased access to transportation. We\u2019ve deferred certain commercial activations and product launches and we\u2019ve invested in technology to support critical business and finance systems. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of the way our supply chain has responded to these challenges. It hasn\u2019t been easy. This has required a lot of extra planning, problem-solving and investment in execution. Another priority during the crisis has been aiding our communities as depicted on Slide #7. We pride ourselves for being a company with heart and soul, and we have stepped up our giving during this crisis, helping our food bank partners and neighbors in need during this pandemic. Local governments have specifically called out food security as a top priority in their fight against COVID-19. And so aligned with our Kellogg\u2019s Better Days Program to aggress food and security around the world, Kellogg and our charitable funds have donated more than $10 million so far in food and funds to fund global COVID-19 food relief efforts. Around the world, we\u2019re donating to everything from local food banks and school feeding programs to childcare centers, hospitals and senior care centers. All of this is completely consistent with Kellogg\u2019s heritage and values, which makes this company truly special. So let\u2019s turn to Slide #8 and put this into the context of business performance and financials. Prior to and during the accelerated global spread of the coronavirus, our base business is performing very well. We accelerated our organic net sales growth, even excluding the estimated impact of the pandemic in March, and we had continued to make progress toward offsetting mix headwinds and sequentially improving our gross profit margin. And as promised, we had boosted our brand-building investment behind targeted brands and categories around the world. We feel as strongly as ever that our Deploy for Growth strategy is working. Then, of course, the crisis hit and redirected our focus and plans. You\u2019ve all seen the scanner data, notably for the United States and Western Europe, which showed a sharp acceleration in consumption growth, beginning around the first and second weeks of March. Since that time, we have been focused on producing and shipping food. Most of our plants have ramped up their production. While in some emerging markets, restrictions and logistical challenges prevent us from running at full capacity. While shipments have accelerated, so has our investment in our plans for safety and for our employee appreciation and benefits and in our logistics for incremental warehouse space and transportation. From a brand investment standpoint, many of our second quarter commercial activities, as well as product launches have been delayed to the third and fourth quarters. So where does this put us for the rest of the year? How long the crisis persists? And how quickly we can return to business as usual operations and commercial activities is obviously unknown at this point. So far, in quarter two, we\u2019re seeing elevated if slowing at-home consumption, partially offset by severe softness and away-from-home channels, a slowing in certain emerging markets, high investment and utilization in our supply chain to get food to the marketplace and less commercial activation and innovation activity, as we and our customers focus on getting food on the shelf. Obviously, the third and fourth quarters are harder to predict. For now though, we are prudently assuming economic softness and investment shifts to create a profit offset to the first-half. Beyond the factors we cannot control, we are prepared to weather the crisis. Our employees are engaged and working to stay safe. We are supplying the market as best we can and our financial health is solid. We\u2019re also taking a very close look at our plans in the event of a prolonged global economic slowdown. We\u2019ve studied what worked well and what did not in past recessions and how this one could be different for the globe and for our portfolio. We strongly believe that our Deploy for Growth strategy with its focus on occasions, growth portfolio, world-class brands and service has us well prepared for making any necessary adjustments. So with that, let me turn it over to Amit, who will take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail.\nAmit Banati: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Clearly, our financial results and outlook have been affected by the pandemic. So I\u2019ll do my best to sort through the financial puts and takes. Slide #10 outlines our financial approach since the crisis began. Employee safety is the top priority and we have invested in this area, in safety supplies, temperature checks, and incremental cleaning protocols. Additionally, we invested in information technology to facilitate working remotely. To supply the market with food, we\u2019ve had to increase production quickly, focusing on priority SKUs and rewarding our people with bonuses and benefits. In addition, we\u2019ve invested in logistics to get food to our customers as quickly as possible. We\u2019ve also worked to ensure financial flexibility. As you know, we had already been focused on reducing our debt leverage this year, and this becomes even more important in an environment of economic recession and volatile financial markets. We continue to have good access to commercial paper markets and we have built up our cash balances around the world. We\u2019ve also been proactive about locking into lower interest rates, reducing our long-term cost of debt. Meanwhile, we remain committed to investing in the future. The crisis has forced us to defer some commercial activity and investments to the second-half. But excluding the divestiture, we did increase our brand-building year-on-year in quarter one, mostly before the crisis really hit us in March. Now turning to Slide #11, let\u2019s look at our financial results for the quarter. Obviously, there are a few moving parts, so I\u2019ll do my best to bucket them. First, our bass business continues to perform very well. Even before and excluding the pandemic impact, our organic net sales growth was strong, even ahead of our expectations. We were also making progress toward our 2020 objective of stabilizing gross profit margin in spite of accelerated mix shifts towards emerging markets. And importantly, we had kicked off the incremental advertising and promotion investments that we had announced a few months ago. The second major factor is something that was already behind us, our divestiture at the end of July 2019. As we had indicated previously, quarter one is a seasonal outlier for this divested business, owing to its Girl Scout cookies. So in Q1, the divestiture impacted our year-on-year net sales growth by negative 9% to 10% and our operating profit growth by about 12%. The next factor is the pandemic. The surge in demand for packaged foods from increased at-home consumption started in early March. This probably contributed approximately half of our organic net sales growth in quarter one. The additional sales growth drove profit growth at low margins due to increased costs and investments around safety, logistics and IT, as well as decisions made that affected our base business. As you know, the crisis did trigger a sharp strengthening of the U.S. dollar against key foreign currencies, creating a much larger-than-expected negative impact on our reported results. Lastly, on earnings per share, we saw the expected pension expense benefit from higher year-on-year pension fund asset valuation at the beginning of the year. And while our decision to prioritize debt reduction did decrease our interest expense as planned, our shares outstanding bid float higher. The result of all of these is an earnings per share that came in well ahead of pace, but that we feel is largely timing-related, as we\u2019ll discuss in a moment. Importantly, our cash flow is also well ahead of pace, which is important as we prioritize financial flexibility going into an economic slowdown. So the results are affected by the pandemic and other factors, but we\u2019ll walk you through them in a bit more detail. Let\u2019s start at the top of the P&L with net sales growth on Slide #12. On organic basis, net sales growth surged to 8% year-on-year in the quarter. We estimate that the pandemic impact drove about half of this growth, suggesting our base business grew at a rate of about 4%. In other words, even excluding the pandemic impact, our base business was accelerating its growth sequentially yet again. Volume growth surged to more than 8%, led by the pandemic-related orders, as well as by a particularly strong quarter for Multipro, the distribution portion of our business in West Africa. This mix shift towards Multipro is a big reason our price mix was slightly negative in the quarter. In fact, while the mix for the total company was negative, pricing remained positive. Our organic net sales growth was across all four regions and across all four category groups within each region: snacks, cereals, frozen foods and noodles and other. The divestiture impact we already discussed. Now that we are past lapping Girl Scout season, this divestiture impact will be less negative, with quarter two\u2019s impact looking like 2019\u2019s quarter four negative 5% to 6% impact: and quarter three, only a partial quarter of impact, more like negative 1% to 2%. As I mentioned, currency also turned more negative on us in quarter one, as the dollar strengthened against key currencies as the pandemic hit. Based on forward rate, we can expect this to be even more of a headwind going forward. Now let\u2019s turn to gross profit margin on Slide #13. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, our goal is to continue to sequentially improve gross profit margin, finishing 2020 at a stable level year-on-year. This requires offsetting underlying input costs inflation, as well as some natural mix shifts in our portfolio, most notably a mix shift towards emerging markets and within those markets towards the distribution arm of our operations in West Africa. These mix shifts are not a concern, as they do not cannibalize any of our developed markets businesses. To offset the impact, you know that we\u2019ve been working on several levers, price realization through revenue growth management, productivity through a variety of initiatives, building scale in emerging markets, and addressing margins in specific product lines, most notably on-the-go pack formats. While Q1 was anything but business as usual, we did continue to make progress in this area. As you can see, our gross profit margin was nearly flat year-on-year aided by the absence of the divested businesses, as well as the actions I just listed. Some of this progress was offset by input cost inflation. Remember, we hedged out most of the year and costs and investments related to safety and cleaning, employee benefits, food donations and logistics during the pandemic. This crisis will create some variability around gross profit margin, as we incur incremental production and incremental costs, but we will continue to make progress towards our full-year goal. Let\u2019s turn to cash flow and capital structure on Slide #14. As shown on the slide, our cash flow was strong in quarter one, up significantly year-on-year, despite the absence of businesses we divested last July. Some of this was timing from quarter four and some of it was inventory depletion and delays of capital investments during the pandemic. But it also reflects strength in our underlying profit performance, good working capital management and reduced cash outlays related to restructurings. The next chart on the slide shows our net debt position. You can see that a combination of last year\u2019s divestiture proceeds and durable cash flow have enabled us to pay down debt and carry higher-than-usual cash balances. In fact, you\u2019ll see that our cash position was over $1 billion at quarter-end. This is simply a proactive approach to financial flexibility in an uncertain operating environment. Our liquidity is good. In addition to our high cash balances, we retained good access to commercial paper and we have $2.5 billion of backup funding facilities. We are in solid financial shape with sufficient flexibility. Let\u2019s now discuss our full-year outlook starting with Slide #15. Our outlook really should be viewed in three time periods. First, there are the actual results of quarter one. Clearly, these results came in better-than-expected, both because of how our underlying business was performing and because of the surge in actual demand brought on by the pandemic. Next, there is quarter two. The pandemic has obviously persisted. And so far in April, we have seen continued elevated levels of at-home consumption. There may be less net sales lift, as consumption growth has moderated, even as food away-from-home channels remains very soft. We should see positive operating leverage from running our plants at high utilization, partly offset by incremental labor and logistics costs to do so. And then there is quarter three and quarter four, the second-half of the year. Of course, no one knows how long the pandemics and related lockdown will persist. At this time, the best we can do is prepare for a correction back to normal rates of consumption in developed markets, albeit with away-from-home channels that will take sometime to recover. In addition, we\u2019ll have increased brand-building and other investments that have been delayed from the first-half. And we have to be ready for potential softness in the emerging markets, which tend to be more vulnerable to recessionary impacts and whose currencies have already weakened. In fact, we saw slowdowns and currency devaluation in certain emerging markets already in late Q1. So we expect to see a shift of sales and profit into the first-half and out of the second-half. You\u2019ll see on Slide #16 that we are forming our full-year guidance today. We think this guidance is the prudent way to plan right now, as we manage through the crisis. Organic net sales growth will slow in the second-half. The question is how much and whether it slows enough to offset the unusually strong growth of the first-half. Currency-neutral, adjusted basis operating profit has the additional variables of shifting investment from the first-half and our desire to retain some flexibility to invest more in business opportunities, as they present themselves. Because net sales and profit are now first-half weighted and well ahead of our full-year pace through quarter one, it would suggest some buys to the high-end of our currency-neutral sales and profit guidance ranges. As you would expect, however, this guidance does not include two uncertain elements First, it does not include any major supply or economic disruptions. This would be something like a plant or warehouse shutdown related to the pandemic, or it could be any significant macro economic volatility beyond what we\u2019ve already experienced. We are in unprecedented times, and we can only guide based on what we know right now. And second, remember, that all of our guidance is on a currency-neutral basis. The pandemic and oil shocks triggered a marked strengthening in the U.S. dollar against major foreign currencies late in quarter one in both emerging and developed markets. This impacted growth in net sales, operating profit and EPS growth by negative 1% to 1.5% in the quarter. And that really only reflected less than a month of impact. A full quarter of these exchange rates would have had that much more negative impact. Obviously, we can\u2019t predict where the dollar will go from here, but this can give you an idea of the magnitude of these recent currency movements. And with that, let me turn it back to Steve for a review of each of our major businesses.\nSteven Cahillane: Thanks, Amit. Eventually, this crisis will pass, and we are doing everything we can to ensure that we emerge right where we thought we\u2019d be. Our strategy is working even as we have to modify commercial activities in what has been essentially a supply-driven market in recent weeks. In addition, we\u2019re doing a lot of thinking and analyzing about how the crisis is generating trial and reappraisal of some of our brands and foods, including, for example, ready-to-eat cereal. Let\u2019s begin with North America in Slide #18. Last July\u2019s divestiture is what pulled down adjusted basis net sales and operating profit by roughly 14% each. Excluding that, this region posted very strong growth in net sales and operating profit. North America had recorded organic net sales growth through the February period against year earlier growth and was on its way to a good first quarter with another quarter of sequential acceleration. Then came March, when the state home mandates went into effect, and we saw a market acceleration in this growth. In the end, we estimate that this pandemic-related surge in demand accounted for about three quarters of our North American region\u2019s organic net sales growth in Q1. Our consumption growth well outpaced our net sales growth in March and the quarter overall, suggesting meaningful depletions of retailer inventories. Not everything is seen a lift during the pandemic, our business in foodservice, vending and convenience stores experienced sharp and sudden net sales declines in March, as schools and restaurants closed and travel came to a halt and that softness continues. Nonetheless, the accelerated net sales growth drove up operating profit in our base business, which excludes the impact of divestiture. And this was despite increased brand-building investment in the base business and incremental costs and investments related to keeping employees safe and enabling our supply chain to keep up with demand. Let\u2019s take a quick look at each of our three major category groupings in North America starting with our largest snacks on Slide #19. This is the business affected by the divestiture, but on an organic basis, its net sales rose almost 11% year-on-year. Snacks organic growth was already strong going into March, driven by solid commercial programs and year two support for Cheez-It Snap\u2019d, and then the business got an extra boost from accelerated consumption growth. During March, U.S. consumption for our crackers jumped almost 40% year-on-year and our salty snacks and portable wholesome snacks were both up nearly 30%. This consumption growth has been broad-based across our portfolio of brands. From an occasion standpoint, we have seen less lift for on-the-go items and more growth for pantry packs, which makes sense. We feel good about the positioning and strength of our North America snacks business as we work daily to keep up with demand. Now let\u2019s turn to North America cereal in Slide #20. Here, too, we saw a market acceleration in U.S. consumption growth in March, plus 43% year-on-year. Beneath that category-wide and portfolio-wide acceleration, we\u2019re in the early stages of our step up in brand-building investment. It\u2019s too early to see the results of these efforts, particularly during March\u2019s acceleration, but we\u2019re pleased to see shared growth in the Taste/Fun segment. Importantly, cereal is one of the food categories, whose consumption has remained at very elevated levels, even after the couple of weeks of consumer stock ups. An interesting thing to watch will be how this stock up and elevated consumption is driving trial and reappraisal of this category. Take a look at Slide #21. U.S. household penetration data showed that our cereal brands collectively gained more than 3 points of penetration in March versus February and did this against all cohorts, whether by age group, income level or households with or without kids. As I mentioned, this is something we\u2019re studying closely and looking to build upon. We know that our cereals are getting into the pantry and that they\u2019re getting consumed. They are iconic brands, great food, versatile across occasions, and a great value for money. Consumers rediscovering these benefits could be very positive for this category, and we plan to seize this opportunity. Now let\u2019s turn to our North America Frozen foods business in Slide #22. Our Eggo brand has been generating strong consumption growth and share gains through February and then saw its U.S. consumption accelerate to over 45% in March. The same is true for Morningstar Farms and our frozen veggie business. This on-trend brand was already showing strong double-digit momentum in consumption in the U.S. and then its consumption growth shut up to over 66%. As our retail partners work to keep shelves filled, many have delayed resets. So we have delayed the first wave of our launch of Incogmeato, the Morningstar Farms sub-line of refrigerated meat alternatives. Instead of launching the burger products at the end of Q1, we now plan to launch them along with the previously planned sausage products sometime later this year. North America had an unusual month to say the least and this unusual environment continues. We\u2019ve shifted investment out of the first-half, given the current situation and into the second-half. And for now, we remain focused on supplying the market with food and keeping our people safe. It will be sometime before condition stabilize. Nonetheless, we feel good about the underlying direction of this business and the years delivery just got much more front weighted to the first-half. Now let\u2019s discuss our international businesses starting with Europe on Slide #23. Europe got out of the gate strongly in 2020, reporting solid organic net sales growth through our February period, both in snacks and cereal. With a pandemic stock-ups and elevated consumption in March, it got an additional lift, probably accounting for half of its growth in the quarter. Interestingly, the lift was far more pronounced on cereal than it was on snacks, probably because the foods consumers were most stocking up on were meal-related. But it could also have to do with the fact that Pringles had such strong momentum already. Regardless, the quarter began and finished with growth across the region. In cereal, we generated particularly promising consumption share and penetration gains through February in the United Kingdom and equally strong momentum in Russia and Pringles recorded notably strong consumption in Germany, Spain and Russia. We still have some work to do on our smaller wholesome snacks businesses, but overall, Kellogg Europe has good underlying fundamentals. We do expect much of this quarter one growth to reverse itself in the second-half. The cancellation of major sporting events has taken away large promotional activities for us, starting in the second quarter, and we\u2019re having to revise commercial plans, particularly around Pringles. Meanwhile, we have to be wary of the currency and economic impacts on markets like Russia and the likelihood of prolong softness in away-from-home channels. So this is the region with the most substantial shift in delivery to the first-half, but that shouldn\u2019t take away from what is a very strong performing region for us. Let\u2019s now turn to Latin America in Slide #24. Latin America is a business that underwent some transition last year, and we are pleased to report that it continues to progress well on its distributor transitions and its ramp up of new cereal and Pringles production facilities in Brazil. Latin America\u2019s organic net sales growth pre-pandemic was quite strong, as was its consumption growth, notably for Pringles in Mexico and Brazil. Then like our other regions, albeit a bit later in the month, Latin America saw a surge in net sales in March, amidst the pandemics stay-at-home guidelines. The lift was probably about a fourth of Latin America\u2019s organic net sales growth in the quarter. The uplift in March was more pronounced in cereal than it was in snacks, similar to what we\u2019ve seen in Europe and it has continued in April. Amidst an uncertain economic environment, we have a Latin American business that is managing well through the challenges. And finally, we\u2019ll discuss AMEA shown on Slide #25. This region\u2019s organic net sales growth was exceptional, led by Africa. Multipro experienced a notably high double-digit gain, accompanied by strong growth in our Middle East, North Africa and Turkey sub-region and an encouraging share gain in South Africa. From a pandemic standpoint, though, AMEA had less of a net positive impact than our other regions. We saw sizable net sales lifts in developed markets like Australia, Japan and South Africa, particularly in cereal. However, we experienced production and distribution challenges in emerging markets, mainly in Asia and Africa. So for the quarter, the pandemic impact on net sales was probably less than a fourth of the region\u2019s overall organic growth and it also added to costs. These challenges have actually gotten more severe in the second quarter, with certain plants in the region only able to produce at partial capacity according to local restrictions and distribution challenges in other markets. In addition, Multipro is experiencing a meaningful slowdown already in the second quarter, feeling the economic impacts of the pandemic, the oil shock, retail closures and soft demand for non-food products that it distributes for other companies. So while temporary and partially offset by good growth elsewhere in the region, AMEA may see some pressure on its sales and profit during the remainder of the year. Nevertheless, this business is operating well and has outstanding growth prospects once we emerge from this pandemic and related economic slowdown. Let\u2019s wrap up with a brief summary on Slide #27. None of us has ever seen the likes of this pandemic. This left us in a state of uncertainty with a continuous flow of heartbreaking infection statistics and also heart-rendering acts of courage and selflessness. We can only hope that this crisis passes quickly and that we can all get on with our normal lives. As a company, we can only manage through the crisis in the right way, keeping our employees safe, supplying food to customers and consumers and giving back to our communities. I think, we\u2019re managing these priorities well and we feel good about our underlying business. We got off to a good start to the year even before COVID-19, sustaining our top line momentum, progressing towards stabilization of gross profit margin, investing in key brands and delivering strong cash flow. We\u2019re confident that when the crisis abates, we\u2019ll be on a solid footing to resume with our strategy and plans. From a financial standpoint, our earnings are now more weighted towards the first-half than originally planned, as the crisis has shifted sales into the first-half and deferred investments to the second-half. That\u2019s a better shape from a planning stance, even if the second-half business environment is anything, but clear. Meantime, with economic recession looming, we\u2019re making sure that we have solid financial flexibility. We may be managing through an unprecedented crisis, but we remain committed to our strategy. As the world emerges from this crisis, you can be sure we will continue to build our plans around a balance between sales growth, profit growth and cash growth over time, always looking to make our brands and our company stronger. In closing, I want to thank our employees for their dedication and hard work. There is nothing normal about the situation in which we find ourselves today. And our employees have risen to the challenge, taking the extra steps necessary to keep each other safe, to supply the world with food and to give back to our communities. I could not be more proud to be a part of this great company. And with that, we\u2019ll open it up for your questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lavery: Good morning. Thank you.\nSteven Cahillane: Good morning, Michael.\nMichael Lavery: Can you touch on the promotional environment and trade spending? And how much, if any, benefit are you getting? Clearly, there\u2019s such a strong consumer demand. It doesn\u2019t seem like the time to price promote, or you \u2013 do you have flexibility around that? And then if so, how much of that just gets deferred? Or is there an opportunity for calendar year savings to come from that?\nSteven Cahillane: Michael, thanks for the question. A couple of things I would tell you. First off, for competitive reasons, we don\u2019t talk about promotional activity. But what I can tell you is in the first quarter, because the pandemic hit so late, it was really a normal environment in terms of pulling back of promotions, not executing commercial activities, and so forth. Obviously, that changes as we get into the second quarter, which is why we\u2019re saying that the second-half of the year, we\u2019ll have some of the deferred investments from the first-half of the year. But the first quarter looked a little bit more normal through really the first \u2013 completely normal through the first two months. And it was really the last two weeks of March that saw the incredible changes, which was really too late to change the commercial activities that we had in place. We did increase brand-building in the first quarter, again, for the same reasons, we committed to doing that. So January and February, we were seeing good organic growth, good commercial activation, good pull-through from our programs. But obviously, everything changed once the pandemic happen hit.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Good morning. A question on how you think things are really going to be impacting your business ongoing into 2021. If you were to think pre-COVID about 2021 earnings and then now after the crisis, how are you looking at that year differently than you did before in terms of, say, earnings power? I would imagine that you\u2019re going to have some opportunities to do some brand-building investments this year that you might not have had. There might even be some positives in terms of the ongoing restaurant declines into that year. But obviously, you noticed some other weaknesses out there like emerging markets that they have a negative hangover. So any thoughts about broad strokes impacts to 2021 and beyond? Thanks.\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. David, thanks for the question. Right now, during this pandemic, we\u2019re really focused on our employee safety, supplying food to the marketplace and aiding our communities when they need it most. This has created an opportunity to invest in our business in the second-half. How that affects 2021, it\u2019s far too early to tell. But we do see opportunities where our products are getting into homes, penetration is going up, consumption is going up. So we\u2019re going to continue to invest in our brands, invest in our people, invest in our business, invest in our company, all with the goal of coming out of this pandemic with a stronger company then we go into it. But it\u2019s far too early to really talk about what the 2020 environment might look like.\nDavid Palmer: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nKenneth Goldman: Hey, good morning, everybody.\nSteven Cahillane: Hi, Ken.\nKenneth Goldman: I\u2019m wondering if you can help us \u2013 I know it\u2019s not easy, but maybe estimate the dollar cost of your direct COVID expenses, things like bonuses, cleaning, et cetera, and how that looks heading into 2Q? And I\u2019m really curious how much of that is one-time versus ongoing? Because very clearly, I think, across the Board versus what some people expected a month ago in food, maybe the flow-through from sales to EBITDA has been a bit more restrained than what some people had modeled a few weeks ago. Obviously, efficiency efforts are put on hold, it\u2019s critical to produce volume with, I guess, less regard than usual for margins. But I do think investors are sort of asking for a better sense of how much of these current incremental costs are truly one-time and fade as we get into the back-half versus things that are going to be ongoing for a little bit of time? And I know it\u2019s such a hard question to answer, but at least with the visibility you have so far, I think, it would be useful perhaps?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Ken, thanks for the question. Obviously, there are one-time direct costs that hit us as we started to prepare ourselves for the pandemic, things like employee bonuses and benefits to our heroes on the front-line to make sure that they\u2019re safe and that they\u2019re being rewarded for what they\u2019re doing for their communities and for our customers and so forth. Warehouse and logistics costs, obviously, going up. When you\u2019re \u2013 when you see demand spikes like this, you have to invest to make sure that our customer service is as high as we can possibly make it and a shout out to our customers. I mean, the environment and customers and the way that they\u2019ve leaned in, and almost the \u2013 what I call the esprit de corps, among the whole industry has been really inspiring to tell you the truth. And then safety, just safety protocols that are different than what they\u2019ve been, PPE equipment and so forth operating in environments with social distancing, changing the way the shifts go in and out, all these things are costs that many of will be one-time in nature as and when this pandemic is over when a vaccine is in place, when we\u2019re back to a normal environment, let\u2019s say. So to be a little bit more direct with your question, you can think about round about $10 million in the first quarter for us in direct costs related to the things that I just described. Obviously, that was the end of the \u2013 just the end of the first quarter, so that would be higher in the second quarter. And so that\u2019s the way we\u2019re looking at it. We\u2019re not going to make any compromises. We\u2019ll make the right level of investments to keep our people safe. That\u2019s the most important thing.\nAmit Banati: I think, if I could just add from a Forex standpoint, most of the transactional Forex we were covered. So I think from a transactional standpoint, the impact of Forex was limited. However, from a translational standpoint, as you well know, the dollar strengthened sharply and that was right towards the end of the quarter. So that\u2019s something that we\u2019d expect to have more of an impact as we go through the year.\nKenneth Goldman: Yes, that\u2019s helpful. Can I ask a very quick follow-up? I think, Amit, you would said that you\u2019re assuming that in the second-half, away-from-home is weaker still, but food-at-home is just back to normal. So first, is that correct? And second, I\u2019m not sure why that would be the case. I guess, it feels a little conservative to me to assume that away-from-home is weaker, but food-at-home is just back to normal, wouldn\u2019t it? Wouldn\u2019t it maybe stand a reason that food-at-home would be a little bit better if people are eating at home a little more?\nAmit Banati: I think it\u2019s fair to assume that foodservice would take longer to ramp back up. So I think that\u2019s an assumption going into the second-half. I think in our emerging markets, we\u2019re starting to see softness in the emerging markets. So there\u2019s an assumption that emerging markets in the second-half would be impacted. And that, there\u2019d be a moderation in the at-home consumption. Now, things are uncertain, so it\u2019s hard to \u2013 we\u2019ve done a range of scenarios and it\u2019s hard to kind of pinpoint on one particular assumption. But that\u2019s \u2013 those are the headline assumptions that we\u2019ve used as we\u2019ve looked at the second-half.\nKenneth Goldman: Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: The next question is from David Driscoll with DD Research. Please go ahead.\nDavid Driscoll: Good morning.\nSteven Cahillane: Hey, David. Good morning, David.\nAmit Banati: Hey, David.\nDavid Driscoll: I want to follow-up \u2013 great. I want to follow-up on Ken\u2019s second question. I think this is the big one. In the second-half of the year when you say there\u2019s the giveback, I mean, it really does seem that in-home consumption is up. It\u2019s going to stay up at some level versus whatever the baselines were for 2020, including the second-half. Why is it that you think that profits are going to be so much lower that you\u2019re just keeping the guidance consistent? I mean, I guess I just want to say it directly, are you just trying to take a conservative approach, because it\u2019s just so hard, because it really feels like on balance, your foodservice business and these away-from-home channels are a smaller portion. If your at-home consumption is elevated in the second-half, you should have a net positive. But it could just be, you don\u2019t really know when you\u2019re taking a conservative view, but I\u2019d really like to test the strength of your conviction on that comment?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. David, thanks for the question. And I think, I wouldn\u2019t disagree with anything that you\u2019re saying. But the real answer is who knows? Who knows how long this change persists and the magnitude of it. And so I think we can be characterized as taking a prudent approach here. And we think prudence in this very uncertain environment is the right way to go. And I give you really four reasons why we\u2019re thinking about this. One is, what I just said, the environment is incredibly uncertain. In fact, most companies are actually withdrawing guidance because of this uncertainty and we\u2019re affirming guidance. The second is lost activities in the second and third quarter. So you have things like the European Championship in Europe, which is a big event for Pringles, that\u2019s not going to happen. You have the lag impact of investments that we\u2019re going to make in the second-half that are not in the first-half. So that there is a big shift from the first-half to the second-half in investments and there\u2019s some volume that\u2019s going to come out in the second-half, because these promotional activities around sports and other things are not going to happen. The third is emerging markets slowdown. We\u2019re already seeing it in large markets. like Nigeria, where we have a big business. You think about oil-based economies, and nobody ever imagined oil would be where it is right now. Well, that\u2019s going to impact these economies. And so we think we can manage through it. We\u2019ve got the right playbook, we\u2019ve been here before, but it\u2019s going to have an impact. Emerging markets are going to slow down. And then finally, and you touched on this, we will have the flexibility to reinvest in the business to make this company stronger and stronger and come out of this pandemic with very good share positions, very high brand equity scores, people who we\u2019ve invested in, and just a better company. And so we think that this is the right approach. I\u2019d like to think we get some credit for affirming guidance and not withdrawing it. But we think this is the right approach, a prudent approach and the right approach for us.\nDavid Driscoll: Can I just do a quick follow-up on your SKU counts? And are you taking this opportunity to reduce your SKUs? And will this have any significant impact on the business going forward?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. David, the answer to that is yes. We need our plants to operate at the highest potential possible in terms of throughputs. So that\u2019s meant really focusing on core SKUs. And if you look at the syndicated data and you look at things like just take ready-to-eat cereal, you look at Blue Box, Frosted Flakes, you look at Red Box Froot Loops, you look at Orange Box, Frosted Mini Wheats, brands are doing very well and growing and we\u2019re really focused on them. Core items and Cheez-It, same thing. How this manifests itself post-crisis? We\u2019ll see. But I would suspect that this is not giving 2021 guidance. But I would suspect in 2021, grocery stores, retail outlets will probably have less SKUs than they had going into the pandemic, but we\u2019ll just have to wait and see.\nDavid Driscoll: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thanks. I think the guidance implies a stronger North America performance this year than you previously expected. And I think that that\u2019s rational. I hope I\u2019m correct, because the offset is really in the emerging markets and maybe a little bit to Europe. So I just want to make sure I\u2019m right on that. And also, when you mentioned these channels that are declining like foodservice C-store travel, is that about like 10% or 15% of North America? Is that a fair assessment? And then the last question was, you mentioned some inventory deloading at retail. Is it possible that, that comes back in 2Q as a benefit?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Thanks for the question, Rob. First off, North America, the answer is yes. They \u2013 they\u2019re performing at a very high level and driving a lot of excellent performance. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, Europe is really the business that was benefited from the first-half and because of Euro championship and other things I mentioned, will not have the same strength in the second-half. And then obviously, the other two regions are very emerging market-focused, and I just talked you through some of the concerns around emerging markets. So you\u2019ve got that right. In terms of the away-from-home business in North America, well, let\u2019s talk globally. It\u2019s about 8% to 10% of our business globally: foodservice, vending, C-stores, college, university, schools, obviously, this business was obviously significantly impacted, as everybody knows. And how that comes back when that comes back, how quickly it comes back, we\u2019ll just have to see. The teams have done a phenomenal job at things like delivering food to children who out of school. And so they\u2019re very hard at work at doing community-based things, but the business has really dramatically changed, as you know. In terms of North America, though, it\u2019s less than 50% of North America business. Internationally, it\u2019s less significant. It\u2019s kind of less than 5%, that channel, of our international businesses.\nRobert Moskow: And the retail inventory deloading?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes, sorry. So, yes, if you look, obviously, our consumption dramatically outpaced our shipments. And so you can think about inventory in the system being down. How quickly we can rebuild inventories will be a function of what happens with ongoing consumption. And right now, we\u2019re seeing consumption continue quite strong. So the ability to rebuild inventories. Again, we\u2019ll have to wait as we just continue to run flat out to supply the demand that\u2019s right in front of us.\nRobert Moskow: All right. Well, the Moskow family is going through a box of cereal every two days. So\u2026\nAmit Banati: Step it up, Rob.\nSteven Cahillane: We appreciate it. Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: The next question is from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nSteven Cahillane: Good morning, Alexia.\nAmit Banati: Good morning.\nAlexia Howard: So next question I have is around the share trends in U.S. cereal. It looks as though as the pandemic accelerated, you lost some ground there. And I\u2019m just curious about whether that\u2019s a capacity constraint or pricing dynamics or whether you plan to make that or you hope to make that up over the next few weeks and months? And then just a second question is a quick follow-up. You mentioned in the prepared remarks that you\u2019ve been studying what works in previous recessions and what might be different this time. I\u2019d like any sort of color commentary you got on what those insights were and how you think things might be different? Thank you.\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Thanks, Alexia. So starting with the cereal and share question. Right now, we\u2019re really in a supply-driven market. But we have lost share, and so admittedly, that\u2019s the case. What\u2019s happened, though, as you think about the demands that this pandemic has created, it\u2019s really been, especially most recently, if you look at the Nielsen, what you characterize as the Taste/Fun, the kids segment driving the category, secondarily, the all family segment slightly behind that, and trailed by the adult segment. And so the structural makeup of our portfolio is what\u2019s creating that share loss, because it\u2019s happening in the adult segment, which is up less than the rest of the categories. We\u2019re making progress and gaining share in the kid segment, brands like Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops. And so, we\u2019re not, as you\u2019ve heard me say in the past, we\u2019re not in the business of donating share. But right now, we\u2019re doing everything we can to satisfy the orders that are coming in. And so we\u2019ll stay mindful of the health of our brands. That\u2019s what I talked about investing in our brands and making sure that we come out of this stronger than we \u2013 than when we went into it. And so that\u2019s kind of the case with U.S. ready-to-eat cereal. In terms of the recessions in a softer economic environment, which obviously, we just saw the results or the GDP numbers yesterday, the just heartbreaking unemployment figures that continue to come out in the United States, 30 million people unemployed, just shocking numbers. and so, we\u2019re preparing ourselves. And so, some of the learnings from past recessions are entry-level price points are important, family size is important, being mindful, though, of continuing to invest in your brands is really important, because it\u2019s about value for money. And maybe one of the most important things is don\u2019t stop innovating. And so some of the mistakes made cross categories in recessions is a hunkering down mentality, which takes away brand-building and slows up on innovation. And people still want good news. People want fun. They want to try things in an affordable way. And our brands are iconic, they bring joy. And so we\u2019ll be bound and determined to continue to invest to innovate, but to be very mindful of the price value relationship, and making sure that people understand how economic, for example, ready-to-eat cereal is in terms of a meal solution. It\u2019s an incredibly economic way to feed your family.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nJohn Renwick: Operator, we\u2019re going to have to cut it there. We gave a few more extra minutes because of the technical is upfront. But thank you, everyone, for your interest. And if you do have follow-ups, please, by all means, give me a call. Thanks for your participation.\nSteven Cahillane: Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steven Cahillane",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Obviously, these are unprecedented times, and our hearts and thoughts go out to the families affected and lives disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, and I sincerely hope you and your families are staying healthy and safe. Today, we'll share with you what we're doing to keep our employees safe and the markets supplied with food and how we're giving back to the community. These are the priorities right now. Obviously, it has been nothing close to business as usual over the past few weeks and is not likely to be business as usual for sometime. That said, we're pleased with the direction our business was going prior to the crisis, and we're proud of the work we've done to manage the business during crisis. Today, we'll discuss how the crisis has impacted our results and give you a sense of how we think the rest of the year could play out. And we'll reassure you that while managing through this crisis, we are also taking prudent steps to ensure stable and dependable performance now and in the future. So let's discuss our priorities during the crisis, starting with Slide #5. Our first priority, of course, is to keep our employees safe. We acted quickly to protect our employees, taking a global crisis management approach. We invested in incremental safety supplies, personal protection equipment, and cleaning protocols across our facilities. We took measures like temperature checks and social distancing protocols in our plants and distribution centers. We provided recognition bonuses, enhanced \u2013 and enhanced benefits like leave policies for our plant and distribution center employees. We implemented travel and meeting restrictions followed by work-from-home policies, investing in technology to make this possible. I meet daily with my leadership team to monitor, assess and make timely decisions, and we're having regular worldwide updates via video conferences with all employees. Safety will continue to be our highest priority. Our next priority has been to ensure we are supplying food to the marketplace, as captured on Slide #6. As a food manufacturer, we have a unique role and responsibility during this crisis. Our beloved foods and brands are sought by consumers worldwide, making it so important for us to find ways to get our products to them. Fortunately, governments have established that food is designated as an essential service and we \u2013 we're collaborating closely with them. As a result, since late February, we've been able to run our plants at full capacity in most markets around the world, increasing production by focusing on key items. We are working closely with our retailers to get them what they need. We've invested in additional warehouse space, redeployment of inventory and increased access to transportation. We've deferred certain commercial activations and product launches and we've invested in technology to support critical business and finance systems. I couldn't be more proud of the way our supply chain has responded to these challenges. It hasn't been easy. This has required a lot of extra planning, problem-solving and investment in execution. Another priority during the crisis has been aiding our communities as depicted on Slide #7. We pride ourselves for being a company with heart and soul, and we have stepped up our giving during this crisis, helping our food bank partners and neighbors in need during this pandemic. Local governments have specifically called out food security as a top priority in their fight against COVID-19. And so aligned with our Kellogg's Better Days Program to aggress food and security around the world, Kellogg and our charitable funds have donated more than $10 million so far in food and funds to fund global COVID-19 food relief efforts. Around the world, we're donating to everything from local food banks and school feeding programs to childcare centers, hospitals and senior care centers. All of this is completely consistent with Kellogg's heritage and values, which makes this company truly special. So let's turn to Slide #8 and put this into the context of business performance and financials. Prior to and during the accelerated global spread of the coronavirus, our base business is performing very well. We accelerated our organic net sales growth, even excluding the estimated impact of the pandemic in March, and we had continued to make progress toward offsetting mix headwinds and sequentially improving our gross profit margin. And as promised, we had boosted our brand-building investment behind targeted brands and categories around the world. We feel as strongly as ever that our Deploy for Growth strategy is working. Then, of course, the crisis hit and redirected our focus and plans. You've all seen the scanner data, notably for the United States and Western Europe, which showed a sharp acceleration in consumption growth, beginning around the first and second weeks of March. Since that time, we have been focused on producing and shipping food. Most of our plants have ramped up their production. While in some emerging markets, restrictions and logistical challenges prevent us from running at full capacity. While shipments have accelerated, so has our investment in our plans for safety and for our employee appreciation and benefits and in our logistics for incremental warehouse space and transportation. From a brand investment standpoint, many of our second quarter commercial activities, as well as product launches have been delayed to the third and fourth quarters. So where does this put us for the rest of the year? How long the crisis persists? And how quickly we can return to business as usual operations and commercial activities is obviously unknown at this point. So far, in quarter two, we're seeing elevated if slowing at-home consumption, partially offset by severe softness and away-from-home channels, a slowing in certain emerging markets, high investment and utilization in our supply chain to get food to the marketplace and less commercial activation and innovation activity, as we and our customers focus on getting food on the shelf. Obviously, the third and fourth quarters are harder to predict. For now though, we are prudently assuming economic softness and investment shifts to create a profit offset to the first-half. Beyond the factors we cannot control, we are prepared to weather the crisis. Our employees are engaged and working to stay safe. We are supplying the market as best we can and our financial health is solid. We're also taking a very close look at our plans in the event of a prolonged global economic slowdown. We've studied what worked well and what did not in past recessions and how this one could be different for the globe and for our portfolio. We strongly believe that our Deploy for Growth strategy with its focus on occasions, growth portfolio, world-class brands and service has us well prepared for making any necessary adjustments. So with that, let me turn it over to Amit, who will take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail. Thanks, Amit. Eventually, this crisis will pass, and we are doing everything we can to ensure that we emerge right where we thought we'd be. Our strategy is working even as we have to modify commercial activities in what has been essentially a supply-driven market in recent weeks. In addition, we're doing a lot of thinking and analyzing about how the crisis is generating trial and reappraisal of some of our brands and foods, including, for example, ready-to-eat cereal. Let's begin with North America in Slide #18. Last July's divestiture is what pulled down adjusted basis net sales and operating profit by roughly 14% each. Excluding that, this region posted very strong growth in net sales and operating profit. North America had recorded organic net sales growth through the February period against year earlier growth and was on its way to a good first quarter with another quarter of sequential acceleration. Then came March, when the state home mandates went into effect, and we saw a market acceleration in this growth. In the end, we estimate that this pandemic-related surge in demand accounted for about three quarters of our North American region's organic net sales growth in Q1. Our consumption growth well outpaced our net sales growth in March and the quarter overall, suggesting meaningful depletions of retailer inventories. Not everything is seen a lift during the pandemic, our business in foodservice, vending and convenience stores experienced sharp and sudden net sales declines in March, as schools and restaurants closed and travel came to a halt and that softness continues. Nonetheless, the accelerated net sales growth drove up operating profit in our base business, which excludes the impact of divestiture. And this was despite increased brand-building investment in the base business and incremental costs and investments related to keeping employees safe and enabling our supply chain to keep up with demand. Let's take a quick look at each of our three major category groupings in North America starting with our largest snacks on Slide #19. This is the business affected by the divestiture, but on an organic basis, its net sales rose almost 11% year-on-year. Snacks organic growth was already strong going into March, driven by solid commercial programs and year two support for Cheez-It Snap'd, and then the business got an extra boost from accelerated consumption growth. During March, U.S. consumption for our crackers jumped almost 40% year-on-year and our salty snacks and portable wholesome snacks were both up nearly 30%. This consumption growth has been broad-based across our portfolio of brands. From an occasion standpoint, we have seen less lift for on-the-go items and more growth for pantry packs, which makes sense. We feel good about the positioning and strength of our North America snacks business as we work daily to keep up with demand. Now let's turn to North America cereal in Slide #20. Here, too, we saw a market acceleration in U.S. consumption growth in March, plus 43% year-on-year. Beneath that category-wide and portfolio-wide acceleration, we're in the early stages of our step up in brand-building investment. It's too early to see the results of these efforts, particularly during March's acceleration, but we're pleased to see shared growth in the Taste/Fun segment. Importantly, cereal is one of the food categories, whose consumption has remained at very elevated levels, even after the couple of weeks of consumer stock ups. An interesting thing to watch will be how this stock up and elevated consumption is driving trial and reappraisal of this category. Take a look at Slide #21. U.S. household penetration data showed that our cereal brands collectively gained more than 3 points of penetration in March versus February and did this against all cohorts, whether by age group, income level or households with or without kids. As I mentioned, this is something we're studying closely and looking to build upon. We know that our cereals are getting into the pantry and that they're getting consumed. They are iconic brands, great food, versatile across occasions, and a great value for money. Consumers rediscovering these benefits could be very positive for this category, and we plan to seize this opportunity. Now let's turn to our North America Frozen foods business in Slide #22. Our Eggo brand has been generating strong consumption growth and share gains through February and then saw its U.S. consumption accelerate to over 45% in March. The same is true for Morningstar Farms and our frozen veggie business. This on-trend brand was already showing strong double-digit momentum in consumption in the U.S. and then its consumption growth shut up to over 66%. As our retail partners work to keep shelves filled, many have delayed resets. So we have delayed the first wave of our launch of Incogmeato, the Morningstar Farms sub-line of refrigerated meat alternatives. Instead of launching the burger products at the end of Q1, we now plan to launch them along with the previously planned sausage products sometime later this year. North America had an unusual month to say the least and this unusual environment continues. We've shifted investment out of the first-half, given the current situation and into the second-half. And for now, we remain focused on supplying the market with food and keeping our people safe. It will be sometime before condition stabilize. Nonetheless, we feel good about the underlying direction of this business and the years delivery just got much more front weighted to the first-half. Now let's discuss our international businesses starting with Europe on Slide #23. Europe got out of the gate strongly in 2020, reporting solid organic net sales growth through our February period, both in snacks and cereal. With a pandemic stock-ups and elevated consumption in March, it got an additional lift, probably accounting for half of its growth in the quarter. Interestingly, the lift was far more pronounced on cereal than it was on snacks, probably because the foods consumers were most stocking up on were meal-related. But it could also have to do with the fact that Pringles had such strong momentum already. Regardless, the quarter began and finished with growth across the region. In cereal, we generated particularly promising consumption share and penetration gains through February in the United Kingdom and equally strong momentum in Russia and Pringles recorded notably strong consumption in Germany, Spain and Russia. We still have some work to do on our smaller wholesome snacks businesses, but overall, Kellogg Europe has good underlying fundamentals. We do expect much of this quarter one growth to reverse itself in the second-half. The cancellation of major sporting events has taken away large promotional activities for us, starting in the second quarter, and we're having to revise commercial plans, particularly around Pringles. Meanwhile, we have to be wary of the currency and economic impacts on markets like Russia and the likelihood of prolong softness in away-from-home channels. So this is the region with the most substantial shift in delivery to the first-half, but that shouldn't take away from what is a very strong performing region for us. Let's now turn to Latin America in Slide #24. Latin America is a business that underwent some transition last year, and we are pleased to report that it continues to progress well on its distributor transitions and its ramp up of new cereal and Pringles production facilities in Brazil. Latin America's organic net sales growth pre-pandemic was quite strong, as was its consumption growth, notably for Pringles in Mexico and Brazil. Then like our other regions, albeit a bit later in the month, Latin America saw a surge in net sales in March, amidst the pandemics stay-at-home guidelines. The lift was probably about a fourth of Latin America's organic net sales growth in the quarter. The uplift in March was more pronounced in cereal than it was in snacks, similar to what we've seen in Europe and it has continued in April. Amidst an uncertain economic environment, we have a Latin American business that is managing well through the challenges. And finally, we'll discuss AMEA shown on Slide #25. This region's organic net sales growth was exceptional, led by Africa. Multipro experienced a notably high double-digit gain, accompanied by strong growth in our Middle East, North Africa and Turkey sub-region and an encouraging share gain in South Africa. From a pandemic standpoint, though, AMEA had less of a net positive impact than our other regions. We saw sizable net sales lifts in developed markets like Australia, Japan and South Africa, particularly in cereal. However, we experienced production and distribution challenges in emerging markets, mainly in Asia and Africa. So for the quarter, the pandemic impact on net sales was probably less than a fourth of the region's overall organic growth and it also added to costs. These challenges have actually gotten more severe in the second quarter, with certain plants in the region only able to produce at partial capacity according to local restrictions and distribution challenges in other markets. In addition, Multipro is experiencing a meaningful slowdown already in the second quarter, feeling the economic impacts of the pandemic, the oil shock, retail closures and soft demand for non-food products that it distributes for other companies. So while temporary and partially offset by good growth elsewhere in the region, AMEA may see some pressure on its sales and profit during the remainder of the year. Nevertheless, this business is operating well and has outstanding growth prospects once we emerge from this pandemic and related economic slowdown. Let's wrap up with a brief summary on Slide #27. None of us has ever seen the likes of this pandemic. This left us in a state of uncertainty with a continuous flow of heartbreaking infection statistics and also heart-rendering acts of courage and selflessness. We can only hope that this crisis passes quickly and that we can all get on with our normal lives. As a company, we can only manage through the crisis in the right way, keeping our employees safe, supplying food to customers and consumers and giving back to our communities. I think, we're managing these priorities well and we feel good about our underlying business. We got off to a good start to the year even before COVID-19, sustaining our top line momentum, progressing towards stabilization of gross profit margin, investing in key brands and delivering strong cash flow. We're confident that when the crisis abates, we'll be on a solid footing to resume with our strategy and plans. From a financial standpoint, our earnings are now more weighted towards the first-half than originally planned, as the crisis has shifted sales into the first-half and deferred investments to the second-half. That's a better shape from a planning stance, even if the second-half business environment is anything, but clear. Meantime, with economic recession looming, we're making sure that we have solid financial flexibility. We may be managing through an unprecedented crisis, but we remain committed to our strategy. As the world emerges from this crisis, you can be sure we will continue to build our plans around a balance between sales growth, profit growth and cash growth over time, always looking to make our brands and our company stronger. In closing, I want to thank our employees for their dedication and hard work. There is nothing normal about the situation in which we find ourselves today. And our employees have risen to the challenge, taking the extra steps necessary to keep each other safe, to supply the world with food and to give back to our communities. I could not be more proud to be a part of this great company. And with that, we'll open it up for your questions. Good morning, Michael. Michael, thanks for the question. A couple of things I would tell you. First off, for competitive reasons, we don't talk about promotional activity. But what I can tell you is in the first quarter, because the pandemic hit so late, it was really a normal environment in terms of pulling back of promotions, not executing commercial activities, and so forth. Obviously, that changes as we get into the second quarter, which is why we're saying that the second-half of the year, we'll have some of the deferred investments from the first-half of the year. But the first quarter looked a little bit more normal through really the first \u2013 completely normal through the first two months. And it was really the last two weeks of March that saw the incredible changes, which was really too late to change the commercial activities that we had in place. We did increase brand-building in the first quarter, again, for the same reasons, we committed to doing that. So January and February, we were seeing good organic growth, good commercial activation, good pull-through from our programs. But obviously, everything changed once the pandemic happen hit. Yes. David, thanks for the question. Right now, during this pandemic, we're really focused on our employee safety, supplying food to the marketplace and aiding our communities when they need it most. This has created an opportunity to invest in our business in the second-half. How that affects 2021, it's far too early to tell. But we do see opportunities where our products are getting into homes, penetration is going up, consumption is going up. So we're going to continue to invest in our brands, invest in our people, invest in our business, invest in our company, all with the goal of coming out of this pandemic with a stronger company then we go into it. But it's far too early to really talk about what the 2020 environment might look like. Hi, Ken. Yes. Ken, thanks for the question. Obviously, there are one-time direct costs that hit us as we started to prepare ourselves for the pandemic, things like employee bonuses and benefits to our heroes on the front-line to make sure that they're safe and that they're being rewarded for what they're doing for their communities and for our customers and so forth. Warehouse and logistics costs, obviously, going up. When you're \u2013 when you see demand spikes like this, you have to invest to make sure that our customer service is as high as we can possibly make it and a shout out to our customers. I mean, the environment and customers and the way that they've leaned in, and almost the \u2013 what I call the esprit de corps, among the whole industry has been really inspiring to tell you the truth. And then safety, just safety protocols that are different than what they've been, PPE equipment and so forth operating in environments with social distancing, changing the way the shifts go in and out, all these things are costs that many of will be one-time in nature as and when this pandemic is over when a vaccine is in place, when we're back to a normal environment, let's say. So to be a little bit more direct with your question, you can think about round about $10 million in the first quarter for us in direct costs related to the things that I just described. Obviously, that was the end of the \u2013 just the end of the first quarter, so that would be higher in the second quarter. And so that's the way we're looking at it. We're not going to make any compromises. We'll make the right level of investments to keep our people safe. That's the most important thing. Hey, David. Good morning, David. Yes. David, thanks for the question. And I think, I wouldn't disagree with anything that you're saying. But the real answer is who knows? Who knows how long this change persists and the magnitude of it. And so I think we can be characterized as taking a prudent approach here. And we think prudence in this very uncertain environment is the right way to go. And I give you really four reasons why we're thinking about this. One is, what I just said, the environment is incredibly uncertain. In fact, most companies are actually withdrawing guidance because of this uncertainty and we're affirming guidance. The second is lost activities in the second and third quarter. So you have things like the European Championship in Europe, which is a big event for Pringles, that's not going to happen. You have the lag impact of investments that we're going to make in the second-half that are not in the first-half. So that there is a big shift from the first-half to the second-half in investments and there's some volume that's going to come out in the second-half, because these promotional activities around sports and other things are not going to happen. The third is emerging markets slowdown. We're already seeing it in large markets. like Nigeria, where we have a big business. You think about oil-based economies, and nobody ever imagined oil would be where it is right now. Well, that's going to impact these economies. And so we think we can manage through it. We've got the right playbook, we've been here before, but it's going to have an impact. Emerging markets are going to slow down. And then finally, and you touched on this, we will have the flexibility to reinvest in the business to make this company stronger and stronger and come out of this pandemic with very good share positions, very high brand equity scores, people who we've invested in, and just a better company. And so we think that this is the right approach. I'd like to think we get some credit for affirming guidance and not withdrawing it. But we think this is the right approach, a prudent approach and the right approach for us. Yes. David, the answer to that is yes. We need our plants to operate at the highest potential possible in terms of throughputs. So that's meant really focusing on core SKUs. And if you look at the syndicated data and you look at things like just take ready-to-eat cereal, you look at Blue Box, Frosted Flakes, you look at Red Box Froot Loops, you look at Orange Box, Frosted Mini Wheats, brands are doing very well and growing and we're really focused on them. Core items and Cheez-It, same thing. How this manifests itself post-crisis? We'll see. But I would suspect that this is not giving 2021 guidance. But I would suspect in 2021, grocery stores, retail outlets will probably have less SKUs than they had going into the pandemic, but we'll just have to wait and see. Yes. Thanks for the question, Rob. First off, North America, the answer is yes. They \u2013 they're performing at a very high level and driving a lot of excellent performance. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, Europe is really the business that was benefited from the first-half and because of Euro championship and other things I mentioned, will not have the same strength in the second-half. And then obviously, the other two regions are very emerging market-focused, and I just talked you through some of the concerns around emerging markets. So you've got that right. In terms of the away-from-home business in North America, well, let's talk globally. It's about 8% to 10% of our business globally: foodservice, vending, C-stores, college, university, schools, obviously, this business was obviously significantly impacted, as everybody knows. And how that comes back when that comes back, how quickly it comes back, we'll just have to see. The teams have done a phenomenal job at things like delivering food to children who out of school. And so they're very hard at work at doing community-based things, but the business has really dramatically changed, as you know. In terms of North America, though, it's less than 50% of North America business. Internationally, it's less significant. It's kind of less than 5%, that channel, of our international businesses. Yes, sorry. So, yes, if you look, obviously, our consumption dramatically outpaced our shipments. And so you can think about inventory in the system being down. How quickly we can rebuild inventories will be a function of what happens with ongoing consumption. And right now, we're seeing consumption continue quite strong. So the ability to rebuild inventories. Again, we'll have to wait as we just continue to run flat out to supply the demand that's right in front of us. We appreciate it. Thanks, Rob. Good morning, Alexia. Yes. Thanks, Alexia. So starting with the cereal and share question. Right now, we're really in a supply-driven market. But we have lost share, and so admittedly, that's the case. What's happened, though, as you think about the demands that this pandemic has created, it's really been, especially most recently, if you look at the Nielsen, what you characterize as the Taste/Fun, the kids segment driving the category, secondarily, the all family segment slightly behind that, and trailed by the adult segment. And so the structural makeup of our portfolio is what's creating that share loss, because it's happening in the adult segment, which is up less than the rest of the categories. We're making progress and gaining share in the kid segment, brands like Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops. And so, we're not, as you've heard me say in the past, we're not in the business of donating share. But right now, we're doing everything we can to satisfy the orders that are coming in. And so we'll stay mindful of the health of our brands. That's what I talked about investing in our brands and making sure that we come out of this stronger than we \u2013 than when we went into it. And so that's kind of the case with U.S. ready-to-eat cereal. In terms of the recessions in a softer economic environment, which obviously, we just saw the results or the GDP numbers yesterday, the just heartbreaking unemployment figures that continue to come out in the United States, 30 million people unemployed, just shocking numbers. and so, we're preparing ourselves. And so, some of the learnings from past recessions are entry-level price points are important, family size is important, being mindful, though, of continuing to invest in your brands is really important, because it's about value for money. And maybe one of the most important things is don't stop innovating. And so some of the mistakes made cross categories in recessions is a hunkering down mentality, which takes away brand-building and slows up on innovation. And people still want good news. People want fun. They want to try things in an affordable way. And our brands are iconic, they bring joy. And so we'll be bound and determined to continue to invest to innovate, but to be very mindful of the price value relationship, and making sure that people understand how economic, for example, ready-to-eat cereal is in terms of a meal solution. It's an incredibly economic way to feed your family. Thanks, everybody."

            "name": "Amit Banati",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Clearly, our financial results and outlook have been affected by the pandemic. So I'll do my best to sort through the financial puts and takes. Slide #10 outlines our financial approach since the crisis began. Employee safety is the top priority and we have invested in this area, in safety supplies, temperature checks, and incremental cleaning protocols. Additionally, we invested in information technology to facilitate working remotely. To supply the market with food, we've had to increase production quickly, focusing on priority SKUs and rewarding our people with bonuses and benefits. In addition, we've invested in logistics to get food to our customers as quickly as possible. We've also worked to ensure financial flexibility. As you know, we had already been focused on reducing our debt leverage this year, and this becomes even more important in an environment of economic recession and volatile financial markets. We continue to have good access to commercial paper markets and we have built up our cash balances around the world. We've also been proactive about locking into lower interest rates, reducing our long-term cost of debt. Meanwhile, we remain committed to investing in the future. The crisis has forced us to defer some commercial activity and investments to the second-half. But excluding the divestiture, we did increase our brand-building year-on-year in quarter one, mostly before the crisis really hit us in March. Now turning to Slide #11, let's look at our financial results for the quarter. Obviously, there are a few moving parts, so I'll do my best to bucket them. First, our bass business continues to perform very well. Even before and excluding the pandemic impact, our organic net sales growth was strong, even ahead of our expectations. We were also making progress toward our 2020 objective of stabilizing gross profit margin in spite of accelerated mix shifts towards emerging markets. And importantly, we had kicked off the incremental advertising and promotion investments that we had announced a few months ago. The second major factor is something that was already behind us, our divestiture at the end of July 2019. As we had indicated previously, quarter one is a seasonal outlier for this divested business, owing to its Girl Scout cookies. So in Q1, the divestiture impacted our year-on-year net sales growth by negative 9% to 10% and our operating profit growth by about 12%. The next factor is the pandemic. The surge in demand for packaged foods from increased at-home consumption started in early March. This probably contributed approximately half of our organic net sales growth in quarter one. The additional sales growth drove profit growth at low margins due to increased costs and investments around safety, logistics and IT, as well as decisions made that affected our base business. As you know, the crisis did trigger a sharp strengthening of the U.S. dollar against key foreign currencies, creating a much larger-than-expected negative impact on our reported results. Lastly, on earnings per share, we saw the expected pension expense benefit from higher year-on-year pension fund asset valuation at the beginning of the year. And while our decision to prioritize debt reduction did decrease our interest expense as planned, our shares outstanding bid float higher. The result of all of these is an earnings per share that came in well ahead of pace, but that we feel is largely timing-related, as we'll discuss in a moment. Importantly, our cash flow is also well ahead of pace, which is important as we prioritize financial flexibility going into an economic slowdown. So the results are affected by the pandemic and other factors, but we'll walk you through them in a bit more detail. Let's start at the top of the P&L with net sales growth on Slide #12. On organic basis, net sales growth surged to 8% year-on-year in the quarter. We estimate that the pandemic impact drove about half of this growth, suggesting our base business grew at a rate of about 4%. In other words, even excluding the pandemic impact, our base business was accelerating its growth sequentially yet again. Volume growth surged to more than 8%, led by the pandemic-related orders, as well as by a particularly strong quarter for Multipro, the distribution portion of our business in West Africa. This mix shift towards Multipro is a big reason our price mix was slightly negative in the quarter. In fact, while the mix for the total company was negative, pricing remained positive. Our organic net sales growth was across all four regions and across all four category groups within each region: snacks, cereals, frozen foods and noodles and other. The divestiture impact we already discussed. Now that we are past lapping Girl Scout season, this divestiture impact will be less negative, with quarter two's impact looking like 2019's quarter four negative 5% to 6% impact: and quarter three, only a partial quarter of impact, more like negative 1% to 2%. As I mentioned, currency also turned more negative on us in quarter one, as the dollar strengthened against key currencies as the pandemic hit. Based on forward rate, we can expect this to be even more of a headwind going forward. Now let's turn to gross profit margin on Slide #13. As we've discussed previously, our goal is to continue to sequentially improve gross profit margin, finishing 2020 at a stable level year-on-year. This requires offsetting underlying input costs inflation, as well as some natural mix shifts in our portfolio, most notably a mix shift towards emerging markets and within those markets towards the distribution arm of our operations in West Africa. These mix shifts are not a concern, as they do not cannibalize any of our developed markets businesses. To offset the impact, you know that we've been working on several levers, price realization through revenue growth management, productivity through a variety of initiatives, building scale in emerging markets, and addressing margins in specific product lines, most notably on-the-go pack formats. While Q1 was anything but business as usual, we did continue to make progress in this area. As you can see, our gross profit margin was nearly flat year-on-year aided by the absence of the divested businesses, as well as the actions I just listed. Some of this progress was offset by input cost inflation. Remember, we hedged out most of the year and costs and investments related to safety and cleaning, employee benefits, food donations and logistics during the pandemic. This crisis will create some variability around gross profit margin, as we incur incremental production and incremental costs, but we will continue to make progress towards our full-year goal. Let's turn to cash flow and capital structure on Slide #14. As shown on the slide, our cash flow was strong in quarter one, up significantly year-on-year, despite the absence of businesses we divested last July. Some of this was timing from quarter four and some of it was inventory depletion and delays of capital investments during the pandemic. But it also reflects strength in our underlying profit performance, good working capital management and reduced cash outlays related to restructurings. The next chart on the slide shows our net debt position. You can see that a combination of last year's divestiture proceeds and durable cash flow have enabled us to pay down debt and carry higher-than-usual cash balances. In fact, you'll see that our cash position was over $1 billion at quarter-end. This is simply a proactive approach to financial flexibility in an uncertain operating environment. Our liquidity is good. In addition to our high cash balances, we retained good access to commercial paper and we have $2.5 billion of backup funding facilities. We are in solid financial shape with sufficient flexibility. Let's now discuss our full-year outlook starting with Slide #15. Our outlook really should be viewed in three time periods. First, there are the actual results of quarter one. Clearly, these results came in better-than-expected, both because of how our underlying business was performing and because of the surge in actual demand brought on by the pandemic. Next, there is quarter two. The pandemic has obviously persisted. And so far in April, we have seen continued elevated levels of at-home consumption. There may be less net sales lift, as consumption growth has moderated, even as food away-from-home channels remains very soft. We should see positive operating leverage from running our plants at high utilization, partly offset by incremental labor and logistics costs to do so. And then there is quarter three and quarter four, the second-half of the year. Of course, no one knows how long the pandemics and related lockdown will persist. At this time, the best we can do is prepare for a correction back to normal rates of consumption in developed markets, albeit with away-from-home channels that will take sometime to recover. In addition, we'll have increased brand-building and other investments that have been delayed from the first-half. And we have to be ready for potential softness in the emerging markets, which tend to be more vulnerable to recessionary impacts and whose currencies have already weakened. In fact, we saw slowdowns and currency devaluation in certain emerging markets already in late Q1. So we expect to see a shift of sales and profit into the first-half and out of the second-half. You'll see on Slide #16 that we are forming our full-year guidance today. We think this guidance is the prudent way to plan right now, as we manage through the crisis. Organic net sales growth will slow in the second-half. The question is how much and whether it slows enough to offset the unusually strong growth of the first-half. Currency-neutral, adjusted basis operating profit has the additional variables of shifting investment from the first-half and our desire to retain some flexibility to invest more in business opportunities, as they present themselves. Because net sales and profit are now first-half weighted and well ahead of our full-year pace through quarter one, it would suggest some buys to the high-end of our currency-neutral sales and profit guidance ranges. As you would expect, however, this guidance does not include two uncertain elements First, it does not include any major supply or economic disruptions. This would be something like a plant or warehouse shutdown related to the pandemic, or it could be any significant macro economic volatility beyond what we've already experienced. We are in unprecedented times, and we can only guide based on what we know right now. And second, remember, that all of our guidance is on a currency-neutral basis. The pandemic and oil shocks triggered a marked strengthening in the U.S. dollar against major foreign currencies late in quarter one in both emerging and developed markets. This impacted growth in net sales, operating profit and EPS growth by negative 1% to 1.5% in the quarter. And that really only reflected less than a month of impact. A full quarter of these exchange rates would have had that much more negative impact. Obviously, we can't predict where the dollar will go from here, but this can give you an idea of the magnitude of these recent currency movements. And with that, let me turn it back to Steve for a review of each of our major businesses. I think, if I could just add from a Forex standpoint, most of the transactional Forex we were covered. So I think from a transactional standpoint, the impact of Forex was limited. However, from a translational standpoint, as you well know, the dollar strengthened sharply and that was right towards the end of the quarter. So that's something that we'd expect to have more of an impact as we go through the year. I think it's fair to assume that foodservice would take longer to ramp back up. So I think that's an assumption going into the second-half. I think in our emerging markets, we're starting to see softness in the emerging markets. So there's an assumption that emerging markets in the second-half would be impacted. And that, there'd be a moderation in the at-home consumption. Now, things are uncertain, so it's hard to \u2013 we've done a range of scenarios and it's hard to kind of pinpoint on one particular assumption. But that's \u2013 those are the headline assumptions that we've used as we've looked at the second-half. Hey, David. Step it up, Rob. Good morning."

Please note, all lines have been placed on mute ahead of the call to avoid any background noise. At this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for Kellogg Company. Mr. Renwick, you may now begin your conference call.\nJohn Renwick: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for a review of our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results as well as comments regarding our outlook for 2022. I'm joined this morning by Steve Cahillane, our Chairman and CEO; and Amit Banati, our Chief Financial Officer. Slide number 3 shows our forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware, certain statements made today such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the third slide of this presentation as well as to our public SEC filings. This is a particular note during the current COVID-19 pandemic and supply and labor disruptions, when the length and severity of these issues and resultant economic and business impacts are so difficult to predict. A recording of today's webcast and supporting documents will be archived for at least 90 days on the Investor page of kelloggcompany.com. As always, when referring to our results and outlook, unless otherwise noted, we will be referring to them on an organic basis for net sales and on a currency-neutral adjusted basis for operating profit and earnings per share. And now I'll turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Cahillane: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I think we can all agree that 2021 was yet another unprecedented year. In addition to lapping an unusually strong 2020, we managed through an operating environment that was more challenging than any other that we can remember. The pandemic persisted, requiring a sustained focus on employee safety, giving back to our communities and working differently. Bottlenecks and shortages on everything from labor to materials to freight impeded supply across the global economy and created incremental costs and inefficiencies that were difficult to plan for. Finally, there was one more extreme challenge in 2021, the acceleration of cost inflation to levels the industry hadn't seen in a decade. Our particular situation was complicated further by a fire in one of our US cereal plants, followed by a labor strike across all four US cereal plants. The fire further strained our network and our ability to build inventory, which served to worsen the situation when we experienced the labor strike. We are pleased to have our team back to work. Strikes are painful for everyone, and not only did this strike affect our employees' lives. It also had a near-term financial impact on the company. It negatively impacted sales and profit in the fourth quarter of 2021, and it will have carryover cost impact in quarter one 2022. It will also have sales impacts through the second quarter as we continue to rebuild inventories. In the end, though, we did what we believe was right for the business over the long-term. Working through these challenges required extraordinary efforts by our employees who clearly rose to the occasion, from safety precautions and volunteerism to incredible agility and creativity by our supply chain to the actions we took to help mitigate the profit impact of high costs, including productivity initiatives and revenue growth management actions, we executed well. The result was delivery of the 2021 guidance we have been raising or reaffirming since early in the year, even despite the labor strike extending well beyond what we had incorporated into our latest guidance. So we're in good condition as we head into 2022. Our international regions continue to demonstrate very strong momentum, each growing ahead of their long-term targets and featuring strong in-market performance and responsible price realization. In North America, our snacks and frozen businesses are showing momentum with 2-year compound annual growth in consumption led by leading world-class brands. The capabilities we enhanced in recent years are paying off. Our data and analytics capabilities are making our marketing dollars go further. Our e-commerce capabilities are sustaining momentum in that emerging channel. Our innovation pipeline is as strong as ever. And you can see how our capabilities around revenue growth management have improved just by looking at the strength of our price/mix performance. Our cash flow remains strong, benefiting from discipline on restructuring outlays, prioritization of capital investment and strong management of core working capital. Along with a deleveraged balance sheet, this gives us financial flexibility, enabling us to increase the cash we return to share owners and keep our powder dry for potential M&A opportunities. We have some work to do. Economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages persist. And after our supply was further disrupted by the fire and strike, we are in the process of recovering production, inventory and service levels as well as commercial programs in that business. And as you'll hear in a moment, we are guiding toward another year of balanced growth even as we take a prudent planning stance toward the current operating environment. Importantly, we remain on our strategy, deploy for balanced growth, which is depicted on slide number 7. This strategy continues to keep us on our path for steady balanced financial delivery. It is designed to accommodate evolving industry conditions, and it is working. And equally importantly, we remain committed to our values as a company. We don't really strive to grow. We strive to grow the right way. Accordingly, we continue to make progress on better days, our ESG-oriented program. Just a few better days, highlights from quarter 4 are shared on slide number 8. As you can see, we remain active in this area, both behind the scenes with donations and sustainability work, but also leveraging some of this good work in our commercial activation. Let me now turn it over to Amit so he can take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail.\nAmit Banati: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide number 10 summarizes our full year results for 2021. As you can see, we met or exceeded our full year guidance on all 4 key metrics. Organic net sales growth came in at 3.5% ahead of our guidance range and equating to a 2-year CAGR of nearly 5%. Clearly, this is strong growth, and it reflects good momentum in the vast majority of our business. Currency-neutral adjusted basis operating profit declined by less than 2% within the guidance range we had last quarter. Importantly, we achieved this in spite of the labor strike that began in the fourth quarter, extending much longer than we had assumed. On a 2-year CAGR basis, excluding from 2019, the since divested businesses, this equates to nearly 4% growth, a very strong performance amidst the significant headwinds that Steve mentioned. Currency-neutral adjusted basis earnings per share increased by more than 1%, in line with the guidance we gave last quarter. And cash flow came in at $1.15 billion, in line with our guidance for $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. And outside of the pandemic lift at 2020, our highest level since 2014 despite having divested major businesses back in 2019. Slide number 11 offers a similar summary for the fourth quarter. As expected, Q4 was the quarter most affected by supply disruptions. Industry-wide bottlenecks and shortages were equally or more prevalent than they were in quarter three. And we also endured the labour strike, which ended up lasting almost the entire fourth quarter. These factors, along with lapping the year ago quarter's extra week, reduced year-on-year declines in currency-neutral adjusted basis, operating profit and earnings per share. Meanwhile, though organic basis net sales growth remained very strong led by sustained momentum in key businesses and brands, along with strong price realization around the world. So aside from transitory supply-related factors, the business remained in good shape through quarter four. Now let's examine these results in a little more detail. We'll start with net sales on slide number 12. As you can see, our organic net sales growth was more than 5% in the quarter and 3.5% for the full year, translating into two-year CAGRs of 4% and 5%, respectively. Volume for the year, of course, lapped last year's strong pandemic driven gains, particularly in the first half. In quarter four, it was also affected by supply disruptions, particularly in North America, where we also endured the labour strike in our cereal business. Price/mix growth for the year was more than 5%. This reflects the revenue growth management actions we took all year as we endeavour to cover rising cost inflation. This price/mix growth accelerated to nearly 9% in quarter four, giving you an idea of just how much our cost inflation has accelerated and just how well, we are executing revenue growth management. Also contributing to it is a relative lack of merchandising activity amidst supply disruptions. Outside of organic growth, we lapped 2020's once every six years 53rd week in quarter four. And foreign currency translation, which has been a tailwind in the first half, turned into a modest headwind in quarter four. Moving down the income statement, slide number 13 shows our gross profit performance. As we had anticipated, our gross profit declined year-on-year in quarter four. Our productivity and revenue growth management actions continued to substantially cover market driven cost inflation even as the latter continued to accelerate. However, there was significant incremental cost and disruption, stemming from the current operating environment. And then on top of that came the supply disruptions and costs related to the strike in our US cereal business. These could not be covered with productivity and pricing. For the full year, we delivered gross profit that was below 2020's unusually high level but still higher than the pre-pandemic 2019. This is a good performance given the decades high commodity and freight costs, the economy wide bottlenecks and shortages, and then the fire and strike. As we have said, in this high cost environment, we have to focus on both margins and dollar growth. On slide number 14, we see SG&A expense, which is comprised of advertising and promotion, R&D and overhead. Last year's quarter three and quarter four were unusual in that they included incremental A&P investment delayed from the first half because of the pandemic. They also included a sizable increase in incentive compensation accruals. But comparing this year's SG&A expense to 2019, both for fourth quarter and full year, we see it was lower. A&P in 2021 was down modestly versus 2020, owing to lapping a 53rd week and to restraining investment behind supply-constrained brands, but it remained higher than 2019, reflecting good sustained support. Overhead, meanwhile, was lower in 2021 than 2020, principally because of lapping high-incentive compensation, but it was also lower than 2019. This two-year decrease is related to reduced travel and meetings during the pandemic, as well as some benefits not likely to recur, but it also reflects the work we did to remove stranded costs after our divestiture. If you look at operating profit on slide number 15, you can see that our fourth quarter came in below that of 2019, as we saw no moderation of the economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages and we experienced incremental disruption and costs related to the labor strike. However, for the full year, our operating profit in 2021 finished above that of 2019, even though that year included seven months of profit from since divested businesses. So notwithstanding the severe transitory disruptions we experienced in quarter four and the lapping of an exceptional pandemic-driven 2020, there is no question that our operating profit remains on an upward path. Slide number 16 shows the operating profit of each of our regions. As you can see, the international regions had another strong year, posting growth on top of growth. The only region whose operating profit is below 2020 and 2019 is North America, where the bottlenecks and shortages were most acute and where we experienced the fire and strike. Moving down the P&L. Let's turn to slide number 17 and the items below operating profit. Interest expense decreased this year on lower debt and the lapping of last year's debt redemption costs in the fourth quarter. Other income decreased because of lower pension income. Effective tax rate came in at 22% rate we had guided to. JV earnings and minority interests were collectively less negative than last year, owing to this year's consolidation of our Africa joint ventures. Average shares outstanding were lower year-on-year due to buybacks we executed early in the year. Let's now discuss our cash flow and balance sheet shown on slide number 18. Cash flow finished in line with our guidance. As expected, we finished 2021 with a cash flow that was below last year's unusually high level, but well ahead of pre-pandemic years, which are the more relevant comparisons. Versus 2018 and 2019, this improvement in cash flow generation was driven by higher operating profit, reduced restructuring-related cash outlays, continued effective management of core working capital and a moderation in our capital expenditure as a percentage of net sales. Meanwhile, our balance sheet remains solid. We continue to reduce net debt, even despite this year's increase in cash returned to share owners in the form of resumed share buybacks and increased dividend. So our financial condition remains quite strong. Let's now turn to our guidance for 2022, starting with some key planning assumptions shown on slide number 19. We approach our 2022 plans with a prudent planning stance, given the current operating environment, including several assumptions that many of you likely have already considered in your models. Already high-cost inflation accelerates in 2022 to a double-digit rate, with first half inflation higher than the second half inflation. Continued productivity and revenue growth management actions continue, which have been successful so far in largely covering market-driven cost inflation. The current environment of bottlenecks and shortages persist, at least through the first half, before moderating across the second half. The US cereal fire and labor strike has a carryover impact through the first half, as we will discuss further in a moment. At-home demand growth continues to gradually decelerate, in part reflected by price elasticity gradually returning over the course of the year. In addition, reinvestment is restored behind capabilities and in a gradual progression on commercial activity behind supply-constrained brands. Aside from the around strike impact, none of this should be news. But in the first half, they do serve to offset what is good underlying momentum in our business, which will then be planar to see in the second half. With that as background, let's now discuss items for 2022, as shown on slide number 20. Organic basis net sales growth should be about 3%, driven by continued strong price/mix around the world. Our international regions have strong momentum, but lapped strong two-year volume growth, while North America faces the aforementioned supply constraints, which may impede shipments early in the year. Adjusted basis operating profit growth should be in the 1% to 2% range, excluding currency. As mentioned, we are planning around the assumption of an environment of high cost inflation and economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages, particularly in the first half, where we are also experiencing carryover impact from last year's strike and fire. In addition, we plan to gradually restore investment in A&P and overhead. Adjusted basis earnings per share growth should also be in the 1% to 2% range before currency. We expect other income to decline because of lower expected pension income and our effective tax rate is projected to move higher to about 22.5%. These should be partially offset by about a 1% decrease in average shares outstanding as we increased our repurchase activity this year. Not included in these forecasts is any attempt to guide for foreign currency translation, which is unpredictable. But if rates today were to prevail, they would represent a headwind of somewhere between 2% and 3%. Cash flow is expected to grow in line with reported basis operating profit and EPS growth, depending on where currency turns out to be, putting us in the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion range and featuring continued discipline on restructuring outlays, core working capital, and capital expenditure. Our plan is to continue to drive balanced financial delivery, balance between timeline growth, profit growth, and cash flow growth, even amidst what is clearly a challenging business environment right now. There are some quarterly facing peculiarities shown on slide number 21 that you should keep in mind as you model 2022. Specifically, we should see an uneven first half versus second half. To begin with, profit comparisons are the toughest in the first half. Then on top of that, this year's first half has added pressures around higher input cost inflation, persisting bottlenecks and shortages, and the strike and fire impacts that we discussed earlier. These begin to clear up or moderate in the second half when you should see profit growth not only resume but get an additional year-on-year lift in quarter four from lapping the impact of the fire and the strike. And with that, let me turn it back to Steve for a review of our major businesses.\nSteve Cahillane: Thanks Amit. I'll start with slide number 23, which shows the two-year compound annual growth rates and net sales across our four regions. Because of the outsized impact of COVID in 2020, this is really the best way to evaluate 2021's performance. And what you see is consistently good two-year growth across all regions in all quarters and the full year. There was notable strength in our three international regions driven by cereal, by snacks and by noodles and other. And North America fared reasonably well in the context of what were, by far, the most severe supply disruptions. Let's review each of our regions in turn, starting with North America on slide number 24. North America's 2021 performance has to be viewed in the context of its year ago comparisons and unusually severe supply constraints. First, remember what we were lapping, a pandemic-related surge in demand, particularly for our most at-home oriented categories, which are cereal, frozen from the griddle and veggie foods. This not only led to exceptionally strong organic net sales growth in 2020, but it also triggered exceptional plant utilization and operating leverage driving up profit that year. We also were lapping a once every six years extra week in our fiscal fourth quarter in 2020. Excluding that 53rd week and any impacts from divestitures or currency translation, North America's operating profit in 2020 grew nearly double digits. Then let's remember the unusual supply constraints we faced in 2021. We ended the year at full capacity utilization in cereal and key elements of our frozen from the griddle categories, with the pandemic delaying our ability to expand capacity as previously planned. We then experienced what all companies\u2019 experienced and unprecedented disruption in global supply chains, which not only impeded shipments and slowed production, but also contributed to unexpected costs. And to make matters worse, we suffered the misfortune of a major fire at one of our cereal plants, followed by a labour strike at all four of our US cereal plants. So to finish 2021 with a 2% two-year CAGR in organic net sales growth and roughly 1% two-year CAGR on operating profit, excluding since divested businesses, is a good achievement. This reflects momentum sustained in key brands outside of cereal. It also reflects productivity and revenue growth management to offset the market-driven inflation in input costs, and it reflects remarkable execution amid unprecedented business conditions. Let's dig into each of the three major category groups within North America, starting with the largest, snacks, on slide number 25. Our North America snacks business finished 2021 with organic net sales growth of 7% year-on-year and 5% on a two-year CAGR basis. This represents a continuation of multiyear momentum for this business and reflects the strength of our brands. Two of these world-class brands are shown on slide number 26. Pringles closing in on $900 million in retail sales in the US had another strong year in 2021. Not only did it gain share year-on-year. But as you can see on the slide, its two-year CAGRs well outpaced the category all year long and even accelerated as the year progressed. The gains were driven by innovation like scorching, the expansion of pack formats like multi-packs and effective advertising from the Super Bowl on. And then there's Cheez-It, now well over $1 billion in US retail sales. This brand drove most of our share gains in crackers in 2021. As you can see, it continues to well outpace the category on a two-year CAGR basis as well driven by innovation like Snap'd, pack formats like Caddies and effective advertising, which drove the core business. But these aren't our only world-class snacking brands. Take a look at the continued momentum in Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Treats shown on slide number 27. Pop-Tarts, with over $800 million in US retail sales, continued its growth momentum in 2021, outpacing the portable wholesome snacks category on a 2-year CAGR in every quarter. Similarly, Rice Krispies Treats also sustained its momentum in 2021. These treats generate $350 million in retail sales. And not only did they gain share again in 2021. Their 2-year CAGRs continued to well outpace the portable wholesome snacks category. Like Pringles and Cheez-It, these are world-class differentiated brands that respond well to innovation and brand building. Turning to Slide number 28. Let's discuss our 2 North American frozen businesses. Lapping high single-digit growth in 2020, these businesses collectively sustain good momentum on a 2-year CAGR basis, even despite operating at/or near full capacity across much of their product lines. Even better, we have capacity coming online in the first half of 2022. Slide number 29 shows how these 2 world-class brands performed in market. With almost $900 million in US retail sales, Eggo sustained solid momentum growth on a 2-year CAGR basis in 2021, only slightly trailing the category as it operated at capacity. Morningstar Farms, our leading plant-based brand, generating nearly $400 million in US retail sales, and it finished the year outpacing the frozen veg/vegan category on a 2-year CAGR basis. So similar to snacks, our Frozen Foods brands continue to demonstrate very strong momentum. Let's round out our discussion of North America with cereal shown on Slide number 30. In addition to lapping 2020's pandemic-aided high single-digit growth, North America cereal faced the most challenging of supply conditions. Recall that we had already been delayed due to the pandemic in previously planned capacity expansions. Then just capacity came the economy-wide shortages and bottlenecks. In late July, we suffered a fire in our Memphis plant, which not only strained our network further, but impeded our ability to build inventory ahead of what would eventually be a strike at all 4 of our US cereal plans, spanning almost the entire fourth quarter. The result of not being able to ship enough product and the related reduction in commercial support for these products was a sharp year-on-year decline in net sales. This was mostly in the second half. In fact, through the first half, our 2-year CAGR for this business was roughly flat. Unfortunately, this has resulted in low inventories and even out of stocks in stores for many of our brands. And we, therefore, elected to pull back on commercial activity. Not only have we had to pull back on A&P investment. We've also had to dramatically reduce our in-store merchandising. The latter can be seen on Slide number 31, specifically using scanner data that chart captures the year-on-year changes in the percent of retail sales volume that was sold on any promotion. It shows how Kellogg was, like the rest of the category, returning to pre-pandemic levels of merchandising in 2021, but then it shows just how much we had to pull back in the fourth quarter, especially late in the quarter due to the strike. Let's talk briefly about how we are thinking about the post strike and fire recovery of this business shown on Slide number 32. As previously mentioned, the fire and strikes cost impacts spans across the fourth quarter of 2021 and quarter 1, 2022, owing to carryover of costs and lost operating leverage. In addition, there will be some missed net sales opportunities as we work to catch up on inventory, both ours and that of our customers. In the end, truly be back on a full commercial program, though we will get started as soon as we can in supporting priority brands and SKUs. This is incorporated into our guidance. Now let's turn to our international regions whose financial performance is shown on Slide number 33. Remember, these are not small businesses. These 3 regions collectively account for more than 40% of our net sales. And what they delivered in 2021 was nothing less than impressive, particularly given worldwide supply challenges. All three posted strong organic basis net sales growth in 2021, with both volume and price mix growing on top of what was strong growth last year. And on operating profit, all posted growth in the high single-digits or double-digits on a currency-neutral basis. Kellogg Europe's organic net sales growth is shown on Slide number 34. In 2021, we sustained strong growth momentum in a region of the world that is comprised predominantly of mature developed markets and an intensely competitive retailer environment. Yet we grew net sales organically for a fourth consecutive year in 2021 and growing both volume and price/mix. As you can see on Slide number 35, the growth was driven by strong in-market performance in both cereal and Pringles. In cereal, master brand advertising and selective innovation continued to drive consumption growth ahead of the category on a two-year CAGR basis in key markets. Pringles, meanwhile, also continues to outpace the category in key markets. The new Sizzl'n line has proven to be incremental, while strong execution of marketing programs, including this year's Euro Soccer Tournament, has continued to drive the base business. Similarly, we sustained multiyear momentum in Latin America, as indicated on Slide number 36. We grew volume in 2021 on top of last year's surge, and we increased our price/mix in order to help cover the double hit of high input costs and adverse transactional foreign currency impact. Slide number 37 shows how this organic net sales growth has been generated in both snacks and cereal using two-year CAGRs. Importantly, this growth was underpinned by good in-market performance. In cereal, our consumption growth on a two-year CAGR basis continues to outpace the category in key markets in 2021. Even on a one year basis, we realized share gains in key markets. Pringles, meanwhile, also gained share, notably in our biggest markets, Mexico and Brazil. We'll finish our review with our largest in terms of net sales, AMEA, which is shown on Slide number 38. This is yet another international region that built on multiyear track record for organic net sales growth. In 2021, Kellogg AMEA grew net sales on an organic basis for a seventh consecutive year. And it not only grew on top of 2020's strong growth, but it accelerated its growth to levels we haven't seen before. Growing both volume and price/mix, this 2021 performance reflected broad-based gains geographically and across category groups. You can see this in the two-year CAGR trends shown on Slide number 39. We continue to see strong organic growth in snacks, cereal and noodles. And in-market, our AMEA cereal consumption outpaced the region's overall category on a one-year and two-year CAGR basis, led by key markets ranging from Australia to India to Saudi Arabia. Pringles recorded similarly impressive consumption performance in 2021 in spite of supply disruptions related to the pandemic. Not only did its consumption outpaced the category on a one-year and two-year basis for the overall region, but it gained share in many of those same key markets. Allow me to wrap up with a brief summary on Slide number 41. What you have seen from us this year should give you confidence of what we can do going forward. Firstly, we executed well through what were extraordinarily challenging business conditions, overcoming obstacles to deliver on full year guidance that we had already raised earlier this year. We faced a rapid acceleration in market-driven input cost inflation, and you saw us substantially cover it with productivity and with very effective revenue growth management actions that enabled us to realize price early and sufficiently. We faced economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages, which created supply disruptions and incremental costs, yet we work through them to continue to service our customers around the world. We even faced the misfortune of a major fire in one of our US plants, followed by a labor strike in one of our businesses, and we worked through those interruptions as well. Secondly, it should be clear that we have strong business momentum. Our international businesses continued to deliver strong growth this year, even accelerating from strong growth last year. They grew in snacks, and they grew in cereal. In North America, our largest business, snacks, delivered outstanding growth and category share performance all year long. Brands like Pringles, Cheez-It, Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Treats have never been stronger. And in our Frozen Foods businesses, we continue to show growth momentum on a two-year CAGR basis. Eggo's growth was strong enough to run up against capacity limitations, which we are resolving. And Morningstar Farms plant-based foods growth came with increased household penetration. And finally, we entered the new year in good financial condition. Our cash flow remains strong, and we have de-levered our balance sheet, giving us good financial flexibility. The result of all this was yet another year of balanced financial delivery in 2021, which we expect to sustain reliably and dependently in 2022. And driving this dependable performance are the talent and determination of our world-class employees who deserve tremendous credit for working through unprecedented challenges and keeping Kellogg on this path of profitable growth. And with that, we'd be happy to take any questions that you might have.\nOperator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] So, we will take our first question from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. Ken, your line is open, please go ahead.\nKen Goldman: Hi thanks and good morning everybody. Steve, you understandably highlighted the strength in North America snacks, which is doing phenomenally. I'm just curious, it did improve by 21% organically. That's a lot more than what's recently been posted and I'm sure a lot of it is just ongoing strength in the business. But I'm just curious if we can sort of parse out what drove the spike, I guess, in this particular Was it other factors? And then I'm also curious to what degree guidance maybe considers what could be a little bit of a reversal there, if that's true, just on the tougher comparison.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. Thanks Ken. I'd say the snacks business, there's not one thing that you would point to. It's really overall broad-based execution, innovation, new pack formats that's driving the underlying momentum of the business. It's across brands. It's Pringles. It's Cheez-It. It's Rice Krispies Treats. It's broadly across customers. Some of it is a return to on-the-go, clearly, which is benefiting. But it's broad-based. It's very good price/mix performance on top of that. The innovations that I already mentioned Scorchin', doing it extremely well. So, it's nice to see a number that's high double-digits for sure. And to your question around what's in guidance, we're not forecasting continued 20% growth, to be sure. And we'll have to lap that next year, but it's a great position to be in, strong brands, differentiated brands, good brand building against those. We kicked off the Pringles Super Bowl campaign on CBS prime time, will be on the big game again this year. So we expect to get off to a very strong start next year in our snacks business as well.\nKen Goldman: Great. Thank you for that. And then a quick follow-up. And Steve, I realized that crystal balls are cloudy right now, but when do you think, we should start expecting to see an inflection in scanner trends for US cereal? With the understanding that there's still a lot of challenges in the first quarter? But just trying to get a sense for when we could wake up one day and say, hey, you know what, cereals bottomed and it may not be growing yet, but it's certainly it's certainly -- the growth is at least accelerating off the bottom. Is that still a month, maybe 2 months away? Just wanted to get a rough idea of how you're seeing that.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. So where we are right now, obviously, we had a strike that last -- almost the entirety of the fourth quarter. And so what you see there is the depletion of our inventory and our customers' inventory. That takes a little while to rebuild. The plants are fully back in business right now. We're delighted that our folks are back. But it's going to take the first quarter to build inventory. It's going to take into the second quarter to rebuild commercial activity. So think about it as 2 halves. The first half of the year, we'll see the continued pressure in US cereal. In the second half, you should see some nice growth in our US cereal business. And so that's really -- I would think about it as a tale of 2 halves. The first half is the reparations necessary, and the second half is the rebuilding of commercial activation, customer programs, commercial activity that will see getting back to growth.\nKen Goldman: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Our next question is from David Palmer from Evercore. David, your line is open. Please go ahead. \nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Good morning. Steve, if you had adequate inventory and normalized advertising and promotion levels for cereal, how much higher do you think your organic revenue growth estimate would have been for 2022? Just trying to isolate how you're thinking about that as a drag?\nSteve Cahillane: David, difficult question to answer. It's obviously a hypothetical, but you can see what's happened to our US cereal performance. We wouldn't have been down 24%, right? And so I think you'd look at it and say we'd be down or up in a plus 1, minus 1 type of range. We're going to lap that in the second half of next year, as I was just saying. We're going to rebuild in the first half and grow in the second half. But clearly, it affected our results in the fourth quarter without a doubt. And that's why we're so pleased to be able to post the type of performance despite -- again, the entirety of the fourth quarter, we had a labor strike. The rest of the portfolio stepped up in such a meaningful way to be able to deliver against our guidance despite this unexpected circumstance, I think, really shows two things. It shows the incredible strength of the portfolio and it's a reminder to all of us that when you hear Kellogg, you think cereal, right? But we're so much more than a cereal company. This business, US cereal, North American cereal is less than 20% of our business. And what you saw is the greater than 20% of the emerging markets business performing, the snacks business I was just talking about performing. All of our international business is performing very well to overcome what was -- could have been a debilitating strike but wasn't.\nDavid Palmer: Yes. No, I think you had point taken. And I think, of course, this is going to be, God-willing, easy comparisons for 2023 for that business. I wanted to ask you on gross margins. Just looking back to 2019, is that -- what do you think is a normalized gross margin for this company after you get past some of these more acute COVID-related supply chain costs? The strike and fire impact ends and pricing catches up. Is 2019 levels at 33.5% to 34%, is that the type of level that this company should operate in longer term?\nAmit Banati: Yes. Absolutely. I think longer term, that would -- we'd want to get back to the pre-pandemic levels of gross margin. I think you saw in quarter four, a further deterioration in our gross margin from quarter three. I think a lot of the factors of quarter three were still at play in quarter four in terms of commodity inflation, in terms of supply bottlenecks and shortages. And of course, the strike had a significant impact on our margins in quarter four. And so the deterioration between quarter three and quarter four was largely due to the strike. I think you're going to continue to see that persist in -- particularly in quarter one, but into quarter two as we rebuild inventory. There are carryover costs of the strike that will flow through into quarter one as well. And so I think from a 2022 standpoint, again, I think similar to what Steve mentioned on cereal, even on gross margins, it'll be kind of a tale of two halves. I think the first half, we continue to see the pressure that we saw in the second half of 2021. So you'll see a similar trend in 2022 first half. And then in the second half, we should see our margins start to improve, particularly in quarter four, as we lap the impact of the fire and the strike. I think where we'll end up for -- on 2022 overall, hard to predict. I think it'll depend a little bit on the supply chain environment. But once you go past 2022, I think from a strategic standpoint, we'd absolutely want to get back to pre-pandemic levels of margins. And that's the focus of all the teams around the world.\nDavid Palmer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar from Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks very much. I guess, Steve and Amit, I'm trying to get a sense of how you see the balance between gross margin and SG&A sort of playing out for the year. I guess, more specifically, would you anticipate somewhat of a pullback on marketing spend really more just in light of sort of the current cereal supply challenges? I'm trying to get a better sense of, I guess, how much the company is planning on sort of needing to lean into SG&A to hit full year targets for this year given where gross margins could come in.\nAmit Banati: Yes. I think, Andrew, like I said on gross margins, we'll see pressure in the first half. We'll see improvement in the second half. And again, there's obviously a little bit of variability depending on how the environment pans out. On SG&A, right now, our thinking -- our planning stance is a modest increase in SG&A for 2022. And so A&P, we'd expect it to be broadly flattish as the restoration of support behind the brands that were supply disrupted is gradual. So as we rebuild inventory, as we rebuild service, we will start rebuilding commercial activation in line with that. And so that played through in the first half. And then I think from an overhead standpoint, there will be a slight increase. I mean we are lapping an unusual 2021, where the pandemic basically persisted for the full year. And so we had reduced travel. We had reduced -- spend on meetings. There were a couple of one-time items. So, overhead versus that base is -- you'd expect a modest increase in overheads.\nAndrew Lazar: Thanks for that. And then just briefly, Steve, I seem to remember, I think it was the very beginning of 2020 pre-pandemic when Kellogg gave guidance for the coming year. It was along the lines of, obviously, snacking and international, the trend line there, even then was really very good. And it's obviously only gotten better since then. And the thinking was, hey, 2020 is going to be the year we've got to really invest in this developed markets cereal business to sort of get it to a more sort of stable to maybe slightly growing kind of pace sustainably. And that was the year Kellogg was in a kind of do what was needed to sort of make that happen. And then, of course, all bets were off given the pandemic came about. And then I realize near-term job number one is let's get product back into the hands of retailers and consumers. Let's get our shelf space back. But if we take sort of the strike and recent events sort of out, if we look back to where you thought that cereal business was then and what it needed. Once you're back up to speed on inventory and on the shelf, I guess, where would you say that business is in terms of sort of taking some of this recent stuff out of the picture? Is there still a necessary sort of level of investment beyond to sort of get it to the right place, or do we not know because so much has happened in the last two years that we really can't go back to what the sort of the commentary was then? If you get my question.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes, I do get your question. I think we were on the road to really good recovery in cereal. And if you look at the underlying health of the big brands, you could see that. And even today, if you look at the brands that we've been able to restore, look at Froot Loops, for example, it's performing very well relative to the rest of the category. And we believe, as I said earlier, it's going to be a tale of two halves. But when we get to the second half, we feel good about our cereal and we feel good about our North American cereal's performance inside the portfolio. And as we've said, even before 2020, we don't need cereal to be a growth business. We needed it to be stable, and we're very confident that we will get it into stability. And if you think about the back half of the year we're in right now, you're going to see that. And that's in our guidance, and we're confident about that. And then when you think about even as far forward as into 2023 and the beginning of 2023, we're going to be lapping the first quarter of this year. So we see turning the corner at the half year as the beginning of a very, very robust, balanced growth for us, and we don't see cereal holding us back.\nAndrew Lazar: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Steve your line is open, please go ahead.\nSteve Powers: Hey thank you and good morning. Just building on that conversation a little bit further. It sounds like you think you can restore trade inventories by mid-year, but how long does it take so you can fully restore market shares, factoring in the need to perhaps earn back some shelf space that you've likely lost your entering calendar 2022? Is that achievable by the end of the calendar year, or is that -- does that also bleed into 2023 in terms of the market share restoration?\nSteve Cahillane: We will see market share restoration -- it'll be different across brands, right? We're focusing first on our biggest brands. And then obviously, we have a number of portfolio that will be not as high a priority in terms of rebuilding inventory and commercial activity. So you'll see us -- you should see regaining market share in the second half of the year, as I said earlier, just as we regain momentum. Hard to give a market share forecast of where we'll be at certain points, but we are bound and determined to restore this business, restore our TDPs, restore all of our commercial activity. And again, in the second half of the year showed real momentum and exit the year with very strong momentum across the entirety of our portfolio, including our North American cereal business.\nSteve Powers: Okay. Very good. Thank you, Steve. And then, Amit, if I could, just maybe a little bit more -- just diving into the nuts and bolts of the outlook. Just any perspective you have on coverage on current cost inflation, just visibility as you enter the year? Where you are in terms of price implementation relative to that inflation? Is there a need for more pricing? How are you thinking about that? And then if you could, just how that nets out. Obviously, the first half, second half commentary you gave clear intuitive sense. But can you help frame that a bit further maybe in terms of just rough estimation of the percentage of earnings you're expecting in the first half versus second half, just to give us order of magnitude? Thank you.\nAmit Banati: Yes. So I think in terms of inflation, I'll start there, it's continued to accelerate, and we've seen that through '21. So we are expecting double-digit inflation in 2022, and bulk of it is market-driven. So I think that's our planning stance. We're seeing inflation in ingredients and packaging, oil, corn, wheat, and on the packaging side, cans, carton. So we're seeing broad-based inflation across our ingredients. We're about 70% hedged on our exchange-traded commodities. So where we can hedge, we are at around a 70% hedged. So that's kind of typical of where we are at this time of the year. We will look to cover the gross margin impact of all the market-related pricing \u2013 inflation through our productivity initiatives, through our revenue growth management initiatives. I think from a supply chain bottleneck standpoint, I think we've talked a little bit of the carryover impact of the strike. So that's going to play out in quarter 1 and moderate into quarter 2. So that's going to impact the first half margins for sure. And then the environment itself, that's hard to predict, but I think what we've assumed is that it'll continue to be a challenging supply chain environment into the first half and then moderate into the second half. I think when you put all of those assumptions together, right, and kind of look at the first half, second half, it's -- obviously, the earnings would be second half weighted compared to the first half. And then I think from a lapse standpoint, obviously, quarter 4 will be our easiest lap when we start lapping the impact of the fire and the strike. So that's broadly the shape of the yield.\nSteve Powers: Okay, very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Our next question is from Alexia Howard from Alliance Bernstein. Alexia, your line is open. Please go ahead. \nAlexia Howard: Good morning everyone.\nAmit Banati: Good morning.\nAlexia Howard: Thank you. So a couple of questions. I noticed that the price/mix growth in AMEA is still incredibly high. I think it was 18% or so this quarter on top of, I think, 10% or so last year. The volumes are obviously down but not down too much, maybe down double-digits over a two-year period. I'm just wondering what's going on in the region. Is it cutting out very low-priced products to get that price/mix growth, so it's more of a mix effect, or is there something else happening there? And then I have a follow-up.\nAmit Banati: Yes. I think, Alexia, the driver for that is really -- I mean we're seeing commodity inflation. We're seeing currency inflation. So I think a lot of that is driven by pricing. And if you look at markets, Multipro is a good example, where we've -- we're taking significant pricing, double-digit pricing, multiple rounds of that to cover the currency and the commodity. I'd say elasticity has been better than expected. So the elasticity has held up, and volumes have held up. What you're seeing in some of the volume declines is also the impact of supply constraints. I think that region, in particular, has been impacted by shortage of containers. We do ship a lot of product. Pringles is a good example. We manufacture that in Malaysia and ship it across the region. And certainly, the shortage of ocean containers has impacted our ability to supply. And likewise, I think there have been just restrictions, lockdown restrictions on some of our facilities that have impacted supply and service. So that's been a dynamic indeed from a volume standpoint. But overall, I'd say, over a two-year period, terrific price/mix performance by the region. And broadly, volumes have held up.\nAlexia Howard: Very helpful. Thank you. And then a quick follow-up. I noticed on the Morningstar Farms graph that the category and the brand have slowed down fairly meaningfully in the fourth quarter. Could you describe, what's happening there and what that means for the incognito part of the brand?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. Alexia, what I'd say is it's helpful to look at the whole category on a two-year basis as well because what we're seeing is obviously a huge influx of new distribution and new entrants, which drove outsized demand and outsized sales in certain areas. And there's a big difference between refrigerated and frozen as well. And what you're seeing is the refrigerated segment has decelerated on a two year CAGR basis and its because of all these, as I said, new entrants, new trial and so forth shaking out. In the frozen side of the business, we're still very pleased about the way Morningstar Farms is performing. And we see what's happening in refrigerated as a lot of shakeout. You typically see this in new categories with lots of new entrants, lots of trial, not always the highest quality items making their way on shelf. And so I think you'll see that shake out. And we do think that over time, refrigerated has an opportunity to be successful, but we're much more pleased about how we're doing in the frozen segment.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. Michael, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lavery: Good morning. Thank you.\nSteve Cahillane: Good morning, Michael.\nMichael Lavery: Yes, good morning. You touched on some of the elasticities you're seeing now. And just curious if you could give a sense of what some of your planning assumptions are. Do you expect that they've been relatively good? Do you expect that to hold? What's in your forecast for how that plays out?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes, Michael. So what we've seen so far is much better than historical elasticity performance. So much more inelastic. We don't forecast for that to continue. Obviously, inflation continues to rage on. We are very pleased with the price/mix that we've seen, but we are forecasting a more return-to-normal elasticities as the year progresses. I don't know, Amit, if you want to\nAmit Banati: No. I think -- yes.\nMichael Lavery: That's really helpful. And just a quick follow-up. You mentioned in your -- early in your release and several times on the call that the balance and financial flexibility you have and dry powder. What are your priorities as you think about M&A, either geographically or by category? Is it as kind of higher priority as that sounds? Can you just give us some thoughts on how you're thinking about that?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. Definitely, Michael. So we're very pleased with the strength of the balance sheet and the deleveraging that's happened over the course of the last couple of years, and it does give us opportunities and optionality. And I think if you look at our portfolio and what's working in the portfolio, you could see us -- that would be good hunting ground. So think snacking, think wellness, think emerging markets. And if we found an opportunity to add shareholder value, we would certainly take a good hard look at it. Always, though, being very disciplined on price.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Great. Thanks so much.\nSteve Cahillane: Operator, we might have time for one more question.\nOperator: Of course, thank you. We will take our last question from Rob Dickerson from Jefferies. Rob, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nRob Dickerson: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Two quick questions. I guess just to touch on the bars category. Obviously, it's been pressured through the pandemic to some extent. I don't know, Steve, just kind of any quick thoughts in terms of potential growth recovery as mobility increases and kind of how you're thinking that -- thinking about that through '22. And I have been -- a quick follow-up.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes, Rob. So when you look at the bars category, you can see it is really highly correlated to occasions. And so I don't think this was your question, but if you look at Rice Krispies Treats, which are bars, doing incredibly well. You look at Nutri-Grain, doing very well. You look at RX, it's back to growth, but not the type of growth that we had seen in the past. And that's due to occasions. I mean I think I just saw something the other day where gym traffic is still down 40% from 2019 prepandemic. And that's a big occasion for RX, right? Throw a bunch of bars in the gym bag and off you go. So we're seeing growth, but I think a lot of higher growth will depend on those types of occasions returning. And we are seeing -- the trend line is positive. We're seeing mobility start to increase. Omicron obviously set it back, but now we're seeing it potentially recover. And we'll see what happens in the spring. It's hard -- somebody mentioned the cloudy crystal ball, certainly cloudy to understand what's going to happen in the spring. But as those occasions return, we think RX and our other portfolio is well placed.\nRob Dickerson: Okay. Fair enough. And then just on the organic sales growth guide, I know you don't always break out price/volume, but just wondering if there's any incremental clarity as to kind of -- for thinking should pricing that we saw in Q4, let's say, which was price/mix, at least kind of close to 9%. As we get through the year and then maybe factor in some increased promotional activity in the back half, should the market be expecting kind of a similar level of pricing, let's say, at least in the first half of the year, or were there some kind of one-offs in Q4 that might cause that to decelerate? That\u2019s all. Thanks.\nAmit Banati: Yes. I think most of our -- if not all of our net sales growth for 2022 would be driven by price/mix. So I think, as I mentioned, right, we're seeing double-digit inflation into 2022. And so I think we're working through plans, both productivity as well as revenue growth management, to counter that and to hold margins. So, you will see most of the sales being driven by price/mix. And RGM activity will continue to be a focus into 2022.\nRob Dickerson: All right. Thank you.\nJohn Renwick: Operator, I think we've hit our time limit. Thanks, everybody, for your interest. And if you have any follow-up questions, please do not hesitate to give us a call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you everyone for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines and have a lovely day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve Cahillane",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I think we can all agree that 2021 was yet another unprecedented year. In addition to lapping an unusually strong 2020, we managed through an operating environment that was more challenging than any other that we can remember. The pandemic persisted, requiring a sustained focus on employee safety, giving back to our communities and working differently. Bottlenecks and shortages on everything from labor to materials to freight impeded supply across the global economy and created incremental costs and inefficiencies that were difficult to plan for. Finally, there was one more extreme challenge in 2021, the acceleration of cost inflation to levels the industry hadn't seen in a decade. Our particular situation was complicated further by a fire in one of our US cereal plants, followed by a labor strike across all four US cereal plants. The fire further strained our network and our ability to build inventory, which served to worsen the situation when we experienced the labor strike. We are pleased to have our team back to work. Strikes are painful for everyone, and not only did this strike affect our employees' lives. It also had a near-term financial impact on the company. It negatively impacted sales and profit in the fourth quarter of 2021, and it will have carryover cost impact in quarter one 2022. It will also have sales impacts through the second quarter as we continue to rebuild inventories. In the end, though, we did what we believe was right for the business over the long-term. Working through these challenges required extraordinary efforts by our employees who clearly rose to the occasion, from safety precautions and volunteerism to incredible agility and creativity by our supply chain to the actions we took to help mitigate the profit impact of high costs, including productivity initiatives and revenue growth management actions, we executed well. The result was delivery of the 2021 guidance we have been raising or reaffirming since early in the year, even despite the labor strike extending well beyond what we had incorporated into our latest guidance. So we're in good condition as we head into 2022. Our international regions continue to demonstrate very strong momentum, each growing ahead of their long-term targets and featuring strong in-market performance and responsible price realization. In North America, our snacks and frozen businesses are showing momentum with 2-year compound annual growth in consumption led by leading world-class brands. The capabilities we enhanced in recent years are paying off. Our data and analytics capabilities are making our marketing dollars go further. Our e-commerce capabilities are sustaining momentum in that emerging channel. Our innovation pipeline is as strong as ever. And you can see how our capabilities around revenue growth management have improved just by looking at the strength of our price/mix performance. Our cash flow remains strong, benefiting from discipline on restructuring outlays, prioritization of capital investment and strong management of core working capital. Along with a deleveraged balance sheet, this gives us financial flexibility, enabling us to increase the cash we return to share owners and keep our powder dry for potential M&A opportunities. We have some work to do. Economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages persist. And after our supply was further disrupted by the fire and strike, we are in the process of recovering production, inventory and service levels as well as commercial programs in that business. And as you'll hear in a moment, we are guiding toward another year of balanced growth even as we take a prudent planning stance toward the current operating environment. Importantly, we remain on our strategy, deploy for balanced growth, which is depicted on slide number 7. This strategy continues to keep us on our path for steady balanced financial delivery. It is designed to accommodate evolving industry conditions, and it is working. And equally importantly, we remain committed to our values as a company. We don't really strive to grow. We strive to grow the right way. Accordingly, we continue to make progress on better days, our ESG-oriented program. Just a few better days, highlights from quarter 4 are shared on slide number 8. As you can see, we remain active in this area, both behind the scenes with donations and sustainability work, but also leveraging some of this good work in our commercial activation. Let me now turn it over to Amit so he can take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail. Thanks Amit. I'll start with slide number 23, which shows the two-year compound annual growth rates and net sales across our four regions. Because of the outsized impact of COVID in 2020, this is really the best way to evaluate 2021's performance. And what you see is consistently good two-year growth across all regions in all quarters and the full year. There was notable strength in our three international regions driven by cereal, by snacks and by noodles and other. And North America fared reasonably well in the context of what were, by far, the most severe supply disruptions. Let's review each of our regions in turn, starting with North America on slide number 24. North America's 2021 performance has to be viewed in the context of its year ago comparisons and unusually severe supply constraints. First, remember what we were lapping, a pandemic-related surge in demand, particularly for our most at-home oriented categories, which are cereal, frozen from the griddle and veggie foods. This not only led to exceptionally strong organic net sales growth in 2020, but it also triggered exceptional plant utilization and operating leverage driving up profit that year. We also were lapping a once every six years extra week in our fiscal fourth quarter in 2020. Excluding that 53rd week and any impacts from divestitures or currency translation, North America's operating profit in 2020 grew nearly double digits. Then let's remember the unusual supply constraints we faced in 2021. We ended the year at full capacity utilization in cereal and key elements of our frozen from the griddle categories, with the pandemic delaying our ability to expand capacity as previously planned. We then experienced what all companies' experienced and unprecedented disruption in global supply chains, which not only impeded shipments and slowed production, but also contributed to unexpected costs. And to make matters worse, we suffered the misfortune of a major fire at one of our cereal plants, followed by a labour strike at all four of our US cereal plants. So to finish 2021 with a 2% two-year CAGR in organic net sales growth and roughly 1% two-year CAGR on operating profit, excluding since divested businesses, is a good achievement. This reflects momentum sustained in key brands outside of cereal. It also reflects productivity and revenue growth management to offset the market-driven inflation in input costs, and it reflects remarkable execution amid unprecedented business conditions. Let's dig into each of the three major category groups within North America, starting with the largest, snacks, on slide number 25. Our North America snacks business finished 2021 with organic net sales growth of 7% year-on-year and 5% on a two-year CAGR basis. This represents a continuation of multiyear momentum for this business and reflects the strength of our brands. Two of these world-class brands are shown on slide number 26. Pringles closing in on $900 million in retail sales in the US had another strong year in 2021. Not only did it gain share year-on-year. But as you can see on the slide, its two-year CAGRs well outpaced the category all year long and even accelerated as the year progressed. The gains were driven by innovation like scorching, the expansion of pack formats like multi-packs and effective advertising from the Super Bowl on. And then there's Cheez-It, now well over $1 billion in US retail sales. This brand drove most of our share gains in crackers in 2021. As you can see, it continues to well outpace the category on a two-year CAGR basis as well driven by innovation like Snap'd, pack formats like Caddies and effective advertising, which drove the core business. But these aren't our only world-class snacking brands. Take a look at the continued momentum in Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Treats shown on slide number 27. Pop-Tarts, with over $800 million in US retail sales, continued its growth momentum in 2021, outpacing the portable wholesome snacks category on a 2-year CAGR in every quarter. Similarly, Rice Krispies Treats also sustained its momentum in 2021. These treats generate $350 million in retail sales. And not only did they gain share again in 2021. Their 2-year CAGRs continued to well outpace the portable wholesome snacks category. Like Pringles and Cheez-It, these are world-class differentiated brands that respond well to innovation and brand building. Turning to Slide number 28. Let's discuss our 2 North American frozen businesses. Lapping high single-digit growth in 2020, these businesses collectively sustain good momentum on a 2-year CAGR basis, even despite operating at/or near full capacity across much of their product lines. Even better, we have capacity coming online in the first half of 2022. Slide number 29 shows how these 2 world-class brands performed in market. With almost $900 million in US retail sales, Eggo sustained solid momentum growth on a 2-year CAGR basis in 2021, only slightly trailing the category as it operated at capacity. Morningstar Farms, our leading plant-based brand, generating nearly $400 million in US retail sales, and it finished the year outpacing the frozen veg/vegan category on a 2-year CAGR basis. So similar to snacks, our Frozen Foods brands continue to demonstrate very strong momentum. Let's round out our discussion of North America with cereal shown on Slide number 30. In addition to lapping 2020's pandemic-aided high single-digit growth, North America cereal faced the most challenging of supply conditions. Recall that we had already been delayed due to the pandemic in previously planned capacity expansions. Then just capacity came the economy-wide shortages and bottlenecks. In late July, we suffered a fire in our Memphis plant, which not only strained our network further, but impeded our ability to build inventory ahead of what would eventually be a strike at all 4 of our US cereal plans, spanning almost the entire fourth quarter. The result of not being able to ship enough product and the related reduction in commercial support for these products was a sharp year-on-year decline in net sales. This was mostly in the second half. In fact, through the first half, our 2-year CAGR for this business was roughly flat. Unfortunately, this has resulted in low inventories and even out of stocks in stores for many of our brands. And we, therefore, elected to pull back on commercial activity. Not only have we had to pull back on A&P investment. We've also had to dramatically reduce our in-store merchandising. The latter can be seen on Slide number 31, specifically using scanner data that chart captures the year-on-year changes in the percent of retail sales volume that was sold on any promotion. It shows how Kellogg was, like the rest of the category, returning to pre-pandemic levels of merchandising in 2021, but then it shows just how much we had to pull back in the fourth quarter, especially late in the quarter due to the strike. Let's talk briefly about how we are thinking about the post strike and fire recovery of this business shown on Slide number 32. As previously mentioned, the fire and strikes cost impacts spans across the fourth quarter of 2021 and quarter 1, 2022, owing to carryover of costs and lost operating leverage. In addition, there will be some missed net sales opportunities as we work to catch up on inventory, both ours and that of our customers. In the end, truly be back on a full commercial program, though we will get started as soon as we can in supporting priority brands and SKUs. This is incorporated into our guidance. Now let's turn to our international regions whose financial performance is shown on Slide number 33. Remember, these are not small businesses. These 3 regions collectively account for more than 40% of our net sales. And what they delivered in 2021 was nothing less than impressive, particularly given worldwide supply challenges. All three posted strong organic basis net sales growth in 2021, with both volume and price mix growing on top of what was strong growth last year. And on operating profit, all posted growth in the high single-digits or double-digits on a currency-neutral basis. Kellogg Europe's organic net sales growth is shown on Slide number 34. In 2021, we sustained strong growth momentum in a region of the world that is comprised predominantly of mature developed markets and an intensely competitive retailer environment. Yet we grew net sales organically for a fourth consecutive year in 2021 and growing both volume and price/mix. As you can see on Slide number 35, the growth was driven by strong in-market performance in both cereal and Pringles. In cereal, master brand advertising and selective innovation continued to drive consumption growth ahead of the category on a two-year CAGR basis in key markets. Pringles, meanwhile, also continues to outpace the category in key markets. The new Sizzl'n line has proven to be incremental, while strong execution of marketing programs, including this year's Euro Soccer Tournament, has continued to drive the base business. Similarly, we sustained multiyear momentum in Latin America, as indicated on Slide number 36. We grew volume in 2021 on top of last year's surge, and we increased our price/mix in order to help cover the double hit of high input costs and adverse transactional foreign currency impact. Slide number 37 shows how this organic net sales growth has been generated in both snacks and cereal using two-year CAGRs. Importantly, this growth was underpinned by good in-market performance. In cereal, our consumption growth on a two-year CAGR basis continues to outpace the category in key markets in 2021. Even on a one year basis, we realized share gains in key markets. Pringles, meanwhile, also gained share, notably in our biggest markets, Mexico and Brazil. We'll finish our review with our largest in terms of net sales, AMEA, which is shown on Slide number 38. This is yet another international region that built on multiyear track record for organic net sales growth. In 2021, Kellogg AMEA grew net sales on an organic basis for a seventh consecutive year. And it not only grew on top of 2020's strong growth, but it accelerated its growth to levels we haven't seen before. Growing both volume and price/mix, this 2021 performance reflected broad-based gains geographically and across category groups. You can see this in the two-year CAGR trends shown on Slide number 39. We continue to see strong organic growth in snacks, cereal and noodles. And in-market, our AMEA cereal consumption outpaced the region's overall category on a one-year and two-year CAGR basis, led by key markets ranging from Australia to India to Saudi Arabia. Pringles recorded similarly impressive consumption performance in 2021 in spite of supply disruptions related to the pandemic. Not only did its consumption outpaced the category on a one-year and two-year basis for the overall region, but it gained share in many of those same key markets. Allow me to wrap up with a brief summary on Slide number 41. What you have seen from us this year should give you confidence of what we can do going forward. Firstly, we executed well through what were extraordinarily challenging business conditions, overcoming obstacles to deliver on full year guidance that we had already raised earlier this year. We faced a rapid acceleration in market-driven input cost inflation, and you saw us substantially cover it with productivity and with very effective revenue growth management actions that enabled us to realize price early and sufficiently. We faced economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages, which created supply disruptions and incremental costs, yet we work through them to continue to service our customers around the world. We even faced the misfortune of a major fire in one of our US plants, followed by a labor strike in one of our businesses, and we worked through those interruptions as well. Secondly, it should be clear that we have strong business momentum. Our international businesses continued to deliver strong growth this year, even accelerating from strong growth last year. They grew in snacks, and they grew in cereal. In North America, our largest business, snacks, delivered outstanding growth and category share performance all year long. Brands like Pringles, Cheez-It, Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Treats have never been stronger. And in our Frozen Foods businesses, we continue to show growth momentum on a two-year CAGR basis. Eggo's growth was strong enough to run up against capacity limitations, which we are resolving. And Morningstar Farms plant-based foods growth came with increased household penetration. And finally, we entered the new year in good financial condition. Our cash flow remains strong, and we have de-levered our balance sheet, giving us good financial flexibility. The result of all this was yet another year of balanced financial delivery in 2021, which we expect to sustain reliably and dependently in 2022. And driving this dependable performance are the talent and determination of our world-class employees who deserve tremendous credit for working through unprecedented challenges and keeping Kellogg on this path of profitable growth. And with that, we'd be happy to take any questions that you might have. Yes. Thanks Ken. I'd say the snacks business, there's not one thing that you would point to. It's really overall broad-based execution, innovation, new pack formats that's driving the underlying momentum of the business. It's across brands. It's Pringles. It's Cheez-It. It's Rice Krispies Treats. It's broadly across customers. Some of it is a return to on-the-go, clearly, which is benefiting. But it's broad-based. It's very good price/mix performance on top of that. The innovations that I already mentioned Scorchin', doing it extremely well. So, it's nice to see a number that's high double-digits for sure. And to your question around what's in guidance, we're not forecasting continued 20% growth, to be sure. And we'll have to lap that next year, but it's a great position to be in, strong brands, differentiated brands, good brand building against those. We kicked off the Pringles Super Bowl campaign on CBS prime time, will be on the big game again this year. So we expect to get off to a very strong start next year in our snacks business as well. Yes. So where we are right now, obviously, we had a strike that last -- almost the entirety of the fourth quarter. And so what you see there is the depletion of our inventory and our customers' inventory. That takes a little while to rebuild. The plants are fully back in business right now. We're delighted that our folks are back. But it's going to take the first quarter to build inventory. It's going to take into the second quarter to rebuild commercial activity. So think about it as 2 halves. The first half of the year, we'll see the continued pressure in US cereal. In the second half, you should see some nice growth in our US cereal business. And so that's really -- I would think about it as a tale of 2 halves. The first half is the reparations necessary, and the second half is the rebuilding of commercial activation, customer programs, commercial activity that will see getting back to growth. David, difficult question to answer. It's obviously a hypothetical, but you can see what's happened to our US cereal performance. We wouldn't have been down 24%, right? And so I think you'd look at it and say we'd be down or up in a plus 1, minus 1 type of range. We're going to lap that in the second half of next year, as I was just saying. We're going to rebuild in the first half and grow in the second half. But clearly, it affected our results in the fourth quarter without a doubt. And that's why we're so pleased to be able to post the type of performance despite -- again, the entirety of the fourth quarter, we had a labor strike. The rest of the portfolio stepped up in such a meaningful way to be able to deliver against our guidance despite this unexpected circumstance, I think, really shows two things. It shows the incredible strength of the portfolio and it's a reminder to all of us that when you hear Kellogg, you think cereal, right? But we're so much more than a cereal company. This business, US cereal, North American cereal is less than 20% of our business. And what you saw is the greater than 20% of the emerging markets business performing, the snacks business I was just talking about performing. All of our international business is performing very well to overcome what was -- could have been a debilitating strike but wasn't. Yes, I do get your question. I think we were on the road to really good recovery in cereal. And if you look at the underlying health of the big brands, you could see that. And even today, if you look at the brands that we've been able to restore, look at Froot Loops, for example, it's performing very well relative to the rest of the category. And we believe, as I said earlier, it's going to be a tale of two halves. But when we get to the second half, we feel good about our cereal and we feel good about our North American cereal's performance inside the portfolio. And as we've said, even before 2020, we don't need cereal to be a growth business. We needed it to be stable, and we're very confident that we will get it into stability. And if you think about the back half of the year we're in right now, you're going to see that. And that's in our guidance, and we're confident about that. And then when you think about even as far forward as into 2023 and the beginning of 2023, we're going to be lapping the first quarter of this year. So we see turning the corner at the half year as the beginning of a very, very robust, balanced growth for us, and we don't see cereal holding us back. We will see market share restoration -- it'll be different across brands, right? We're focusing first on our biggest brands. And then obviously, we have a number of portfolio that will be not as high a priority in terms of rebuilding inventory and commercial activity. So you'll see us -- you should see regaining market share in the second half of the year, as I said earlier, just as we regain momentum. Hard to give a market share forecast of where we'll be at certain points, but we are bound and determined to restore this business, restore our TDPs, restore all of our commercial activity. And again, in the second half of the year showed real momentum and exit the year with very strong momentum across the entirety of our portfolio, including our North American cereal business. Yes. Alexia, what I'd say is it's helpful to look at the whole category on a two-year basis as well because what we're seeing is obviously a huge influx of new distribution and new entrants, which drove outsized demand and outsized sales in certain areas. And there's a big difference between refrigerated and frozen as well. And what you're seeing is the refrigerated segment has decelerated on a two year CAGR basis and its because of all these, as I said, new entrants, new trial and so forth shaking out. In the frozen side of the business, we're still very pleased about the way Morningstar Farms is performing. And we see what's happening in refrigerated as a lot of shakeout. You typically see this in new categories with lots of new entrants, lots of trial, not always the highest quality items making their way on shelf. And so I think you'll see that shake out. And we do think that over time, refrigerated has an opportunity to be successful, but we're much more pleased about how we're doing in the frozen segment. Good morning, Michael. Yes, Michael. So what we've seen so far is much better than historical elasticity performance. So much more inelastic. We don't forecast for that to continue. Obviously, inflation continues to rage on. We are very pleased with the price/mix that we've seen, but we are forecasting a more return-to-normal elasticities as the year progresses. I don't know, Amit, if you want to Yes. Definitely, Michael. So we're very pleased with the strength of the balance sheet and the deleveraging that's happened over the course of the last couple of years, and it does give us opportunities and optionality. And I think if you look at our portfolio and what's working in the portfolio, you could see us -- that would be good hunting ground. So think snacking, think wellness, think emerging markets. And if we found an opportunity to add shareholder value, we would certainly take a good hard look at it. Always, though, being very disciplined on price. Operator, we might have time for one more question. Yes, Rob. So when you look at the bars category, you can see it is really highly correlated to occasions. And so I don't think this was your question, but if you look at Rice Krispies Treats, which are bars, doing incredibly well. You look at Nutri-Grain, doing very well. You look at RX, it's back to growth, but not the type of growth that we had seen in the past. And that's due to occasions. I mean I think I just saw something the other day where gym traffic is still down 40% from 2019 prepandemic. And that's a big occasion for RX, right? Throw a bunch of bars in the gym bag and off you go. So we're seeing growth, but I think a lot of higher growth will depend on those types of occasions returning. And we are seeing -- the trend line is positive. We're seeing mobility start to increase. Omicron obviously set it back, but now we're seeing it potentially recover. And we'll see what happens in the spring. It's hard -- somebody mentioned the cloudy crystal ball, certainly cloudy to understand what's going to happen in the spring. But as those occasions return, we think RX and our other portfolio is well placed."

            "name": "Amit Banati",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide number 10 summarizes our full year results for 2021. As you can see, we met or exceeded our full year guidance on all 4 key metrics. Organic net sales growth came in at 3.5% ahead of our guidance range and equating to a 2-year CAGR of nearly 5%. Clearly, this is strong growth, and it reflects good momentum in the vast majority of our business. Currency-neutral adjusted basis operating profit declined by less than 2% within the guidance range we had last quarter. Importantly, we achieved this in spite of the labor strike that began in the fourth quarter, extending much longer than we had assumed. On a 2-year CAGR basis, excluding from 2019, the since divested businesses, this equates to nearly 4% growth, a very strong performance amidst the significant headwinds that Steve mentioned. Currency-neutral adjusted basis earnings per share increased by more than 1%, in line with the guidance we gave last quarter. And cash flow came in at $1.15 billion, in line with our guidance for $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. And outside of the pandemic lift at 2020, our highest level since 2014 despite having divested major businesses back in 2019. Slide number 11 offers a similar summary for the fourth quarter. As expected, Q4 was the quarter most affected by supply disruptions. Industry-wide bottlenecks and shortages were equally or more prevalent than they were in quarter three. And we also endured the labour strike, which ended up lasting almost the entire fourth quarter. These factors, along with lapping the year ago quarter's extra week, reduced year-on-year declines in currency-neutral adjusted basis, operating profit and earnings per share. Meanwhile, though organic basis net sales growth remained very strong led by sustained momentum in key businesses and brands, along with strong price realization around the world. So aside from transitory supply-related factors, the business remained in good shape through quarter four. Now let's examine these results in a little more detail. We'll start with net sales on slide number 12. As you can see, our organic net sales growth was more than 5% in the quarter and 3.5% for the full year, translating into two-year CAGRs of 4% and 5%, respectively. Volume for the year, of course, lapped last year's strong pandemic driven gains, particularly in the first half. In quarter four, it was also affected by supply disruptions, particularly in North America, where we also endured the labour strike in our cereal business. Price/mix growth for the year was more than 5%. This reflects the revenue growth management actions we took all year as we endeavour to cover rising cost inflation. This price/mix growth accelerated to nearly 9% in quarter four, giving you an idea of just how much our cost inflation has accelerated and just how well, we are executing revenue growth management. Also contributing to it is a relative lack of merchandising activity amidst supply disruptions. Outside of organic growth, we lapped 2020's once every six years 53rd week in quarter four. And foreign currency translation, which has been a tailwind in the first half, turned into a modest headwind in quarter four. Moving down the income statement, slide number 13 shows our gross profit performance. As we had anticipated, our gross profit declined year-on-year in quarter four. Our productivity and revenue growth management actions continued to substantially cover market driven cost inflation even as the latter continued to accelerate. However, there was significant incremental cost and disruption, stemming from the current operating environment. And then on top of that came the supply disruptions and costs related to the strike in our US cereal business. These could not be covered with productivity and pricing. For the full year, we delivered gross profit that was below 2020's unusually high level but still higher than the pre-pandemic 2019. This is a good performance given the decades high commodity and freight costs, the economy wide bottlenecks and shortages, and then the fire and strike. As we have said, in this high cost environment, we have to focus on both margins and dollar growth. On slide number 14, we see SG&A expense, which is comprised of advertising and promotion, R&D and overhead. Last year's quarter three and quarter four were unusual in that they included incremental A&P investment delayed from the first half because of the pandemic. They also included a sizable increase in incentive compensation accruals. But comparing this year's SG&A expense to 2019, both for fourth quarter and full year, we see it was lower. A&P in 2021 was down modestly versus 2020, owing to lapping a 53rd week and to restraining investment behind supply-constrained brands, but it remained higher than 2019, reflecting good sustained support. Overhead, meanwhile, was lower in 2021 than 2020, principally because of lapping high-incentive compensation, but it was also lower than 2019. This two-year decrease is related to reduced travel and meetings during the pandemic, as well as some benefits not likely to recur, but it also reflects the work we did to remove stranded costs after our divestiture. If you look at operating profit on slide number 15, you can see that our fourth quarter came in below that of 2019, as we saw no moderation of the economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages and we experienced incremental disruption and costs related to the labor strike. However, for the full year, our operating profit in 2021 finished above that of 2019, even though that year included seven months of profit from since divested businesses. So notwithstanding the severe transitory disruptions we experienced in quarter four and the lapping of an exceptional pandemic-driven 2020, there is no question that our operating profit remains on an upward path. Slide number 16 shows the operating profit of each of our regions. As you can see, the international regions had another strong year, posting growth on top of growth. The only region whose operating profit is below 2020 and 2019 is North America, where the bottlenecks and shortages were most acute and where we experienced the fire and strike. Moving down the P&L. Let's turn to slide number 17 and the items below operating profit. Interest expense decreased this year on lower debt and the lapping of last year's debt redemption costs in the fourth quarter. Other income decreased because of lower pension income. Effective tax rate came in at 22% rate we had guided to. JV earnings and minority interests were collectively less negative than last year, owing to this year's consolidation of our Africa joint ventures. Average shares outstanding were lower year-on-year due to buybacks we executed early in the year. Let's now discuss our cash flow and balance sheet shown on slide number 18. Cash flow finished in line with our guidance. As expected, we finished 2021 with a cash flow that was below last year's unusually high level, but well ahead of pre-pandemic years, which are the more relevant comparisons. Versus 2018 and 2019, this improvement in cash flow generation was driven by higher operating profit, reduced restructuring-related cash outlays, continued effective management of core working capital and a moderation in our capital expenditure as a percentage of net sales. Meanwhile, our balance sheet remains solid. We continue to reduce net debt, even despite this year's increase in cash returned to share owners in the form of resumed share buybacks and increased dividend. So our financial condition remains quite strong. Let's now turn to our guidance for 2022, starting with some key planning assumptions shown on slide number 19. We approach our 2022 plans with a prudent planning stance, given the current operating environment, including several assumptions that many of you likely have already considered in your models. Already high-cost inflation accelerates in 2022 to a double-digit rate, with first half inflation higher than the second half inflation. Continued productivity and revenue growth management actions continue, which have been successful so far in largely covering market-driven cost inflation. The current environment of bottlenecks and shortages persist, at least through the first half, before moderating across the second half. The US cereal fire and labor strike has a carryover impact through the first half, as we will discuss further in a moment. At-home demand growth continues to gradually decelerate, in part reflected by price elasticity gradually returning over the course of the year. In addition, reinvestment is restored behind capabilities and in a gradual progression on commercial activity behind supply-constrained brands. Aside from the around strike impact, none of this should be news. But in the first half, they do serve to offset what is good underlying momentum in our business, which will then be planar to see in the second half. With that as background, let's now discuss items for 2022, as shown on slide number 20. Organic basis net sales growth should be about 3%, driven by continued strong price/mix around the world. Our international regions have strong momentum, but lapped strong two-year volume growth, while North America faces the aforementioned supply constraints, which may impede shipments early in the year. Adjusted basis operating profit growth should be in the 1% to 2% range, excluding currency. As mentioned, we are planning around the assumption of an environment of high cost inflation and economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages, particularly in the first half, where we are also experiencing carryover impact from last year's strike and fire. In addition, we plan to gradually restore investment in A&P and overhead. Adjusted basis earnings per share growth should also be in the 1% to 2% range before currency. We expect other income to decline because of lower expected pension income and our effective tax rate is projected to move higher to about 22.5%. These should be partially offset by about a 1% decrease in average shares outstanding as we increased our repurchase activity this year. Not included in these forecasts is any attempt to guide for foreign currency translation, which is unpredictable. But if rates today were to prevail, they would represent a headwind of somewhere between 2% and 3%. Cash flow is expected to grow in line with reported basis operating profit and EPS growth, depending on where currency turns out to be, putting us in the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion range and featuring continued discipline on restructuring outlays, core working capital, and capital expenditure. Our plan is to continue to drive balanced financial delivery, balance between timeline growth, profit growth, and cash flow growth, even amidst what is clearly a challenging business environment right now. There are some quarterly facing peculiarities shown on slide number 21 that you should keep in mind as you model 2022. Specifically, we should see an uneven first half versus second half. To begin with, profit comparisons are the toughest in the first half. Then on top of that, this year's first half has added pressures around higher input cost inflation, persisting bottlenecks and shortages, and the strike and fire impacts that we discussed earlier. These begin to clear up or moderate in the second half when you should see profit growth not only resume but get an additional year-on-year lift in quarter four from lapping the impact of the fire and the strike. And with that, let me turn it back to Steve for a review of our major businesses. Yes. Absolutely. I think longer term, that would -- we'd want to get back to the pre-pandemic levels of gross margin. I think you saw in quarter four, a further deterioration in our gross margin from quarter three. I think a lot of the factors of quarter three were still at play in quarter four in terms of commodity inflation, in terms of supply bottlenecks and shortages. And of course, the strike had a significant impact on our margins in quarter four. And so the deterioration between quarter three and quarter four was largely due to the strike. I think you're going to continue to see that persist in -- particularly in quarter one, but into quarter two as we rebuild inventory. There are carryover costs of the strike that will flow through into quarter one as well. And so I think from a 2022 standpoint, again, I think similar to what Steve mentioned on cereal, even on gross margins, it'll be kind of a tale of two halves. I think the first half, we continue to see the pressure that we saw in the second half of 2021. So you'll see a similar trend in 2022 first half. And then in the second half, we should see our margins start to improve, particularly in quarter four, as we lap the impact of the fire and the strike. I think where we'll end up for -- on 2022 overall, hard to predict. I think it'll depend a little bit on the supply chain environment. But once you go past 2022, I think from a strategic standpoint, we'd absolutely want to get back to pre-pandemic levels of margins. And that's the focus of all the teams around the world. Yes. I think, Andrew, like I said on gross margins, we'll see pressure in the first half. We'll see improvement in the second half. And again, there's obviously a little bit of variability depending on how the environment pans out. On SG&A, right now, our thinking -- our planning stance is a modest increase in SG&A for 2022. And so A&P, we'd expect it to be broadly flattish as the restoration of support behind the brands that were supply disrupted is gradual. So as we rebuild inventory, as we rebuild service, we will start rebuilding commercial activation in line with that. And so that played through in the first half. And then I think from an overhead standpoint, there will be a slight increase. I mean we are lapping an unusual 2021, where the pandemic basically persisted for the full year. And so we had reduced travel. We had reduced -- spend on meetings. There were a couple of one-time items. So, overhead versus that base is -- you'd expect a modest increase in overheads. Yes. So I think in terms of inflation, I'll start there, it's continued to accelerate, and we've seen that through '21. So we are expecting double-digit inflation in 2022, and bulk of it is market-driven. So I think that's our planning stance. We're seeing inflation in ingredients and packaging, oil, corn, wheat, and on the packaging side, cans, carton. So we're seeing broad-based inflation across our ingredients. We're about 70% hedged on our exchange-traded commodities. So where we can hedge, we are at around a 70% hedged. So that's kind of typical of where we are at this time of the year. We will look to cover the gross margin impact of all the market-related pricing \u2013 inflation through our productivity initiatives, through our revenue growth management initiatives. I think from a supply chain bottleneck standpoint, I think we've talked a little bit of the carryover impact of the strike. So that's going to play out in quarter 1 and moderate into quarter 2. So that's going to impact the first half margins for sure. And then the environment itself, that's hard to predict, but I think what we've assumed is that it'll continue to be a challenging supply chain environment into the first half and then moderate into the second half. I think when you put all of those assumptions together, right, and kind of look at the first half, second half, it's -- obviously, the earnings would be second half weighted compared to the first half. And then I think from a lapse standpoint, obviously, quarter 4 will be our easiest lap when we start lapping the impact of the fire and the strike. So that's broadly the shape of the yield. Good morning. Yes. I think, Alexia, the driver for that is really -- I mean we're seeing commodity inflation. We're seeing currency inflation. So I think a lot of that is driven by pricing. And if you look at markets, Multipro is a good example, where we've -- we're taking significant pricing, double-digit pricing, multiple rounds of that to cover the currency and the commodity. I'd say elasticity has been better than expected. So the elasticity has held up, and volumes have held up. What you're seeing in some of the volume declines is also the impact of supply constraints. I think that region, in particular, has been impacted by shortage of containers. We do ship a lot of product. Pringles is a good example. We manufacture that in Malaysia and ship it across the region. And certainly, the shortage of ocean containers has impacted our ability to supply. And likewise, I think there have been just restrictions, lockdown restrictions on some of our facilities that have impacted supply and service. So that's been a dynamic indeed from a volume standpoint. But overall, I'd say, over a two-year period, terrific price/mix performance by the region. And broadly, volumes have held up. No. I think -- yes. Yes. I think most of our -- if not all of our net sales growth for 2022 would be driven by price/mix. So I think, as I mentioned, right, we're seeing double-digit inflation into 2022. And so I think we're working through plans, both productivity as well as revenue growth management, to counter that and to hold margins. So, you will see most of the sales being driven by price/mix. And RGM activity will continue to be a focus into 2022."

At this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for Kellogg Company. Mr. Renwick, you may begin your conference call.\nJohn Renwick: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for a review of our Third Quarter 2021 results, as well as an update regarding our outlook for the full-year 2021. I'm joined this morning by Steven Cahillane, our Chairman and CEO, and Amit Banati, our Chief Financial Officer. Slide number 3 shows our forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware certain statements made today, such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance, are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the third slide of this presentation, as well as to our public SEC filings.  This is a particular note during the current COVID-19 pandemic, and supply and labor disruptions, when the length and severity of these issues and resultant economic and business impacts, are so difficult to predict. A recording of today's webcast and supporting documents, will be archived for at least 90 days on the Investor page of kelloggCompany.com. As always, when referring to our results and outlook, unless otherwise noted, we will be referring to them on an organic basis for net sales and on Currency-neutral adjusted-basis for operating profit and earnings per share. And now I'll turn it over to Steve.\nSteven Cahillane: Thanks, John. And good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are doing well. After all, we're still managing through a pandemic and still nowhere close to what any of us would call life as normal. This is certainly true from a business perspective as well. Therefore, we remain focused on keeping our employees safe and aiding our communities is more important than ever. We also continue to supply the world with food. But as we and all companies have discussed previously, this has gotten extremely challenging. Importantly, we remain on our strategy, deploy for balanced growth, which is depicted on Slide number 6.  This strategy continues to keep us on our path for steady, balanced financial returns for shareowners. We also continue to make progress on Better Days, our ESG-oriented program. A few Better Days highlights from quarter 3 are shared on Slide number 7. This remains a critical element of our strategy. A clear focus of management, and a part of the DNA of Kellogg Company. And we have not lost sight of this during the current pandemic and business environment. And there is no question that today's business environment is as challenging as we've ever seen it.  Our organization has risen to all of these challenges using creativity, skills, and work ethic to manage through them. Slide number 8, attempts to categorize these challenges into 3 basic buckets. First, we're all familiar with the surges and market prices for commodities, packaging, and freight, all the result of supply demand and balances that may take some time to work out. We're working hard to mitigate the margin impact s of these high costs.  From our active hedging program, which has given a strong visibility into our commodity costs, to mitigating cost pressures with productivity initiatives and revenue growth management actions. Second, by now, we're also all aware of the economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages, that are not only pushing costs higher, but are also making it very difficult to supply the market. Here's where our supply chains-controlled power approach has provided us agility and addressing shortages, and gaps, and materials, equipment, and land and ocean freight.  We've also taken actions to reduce complexity in our portfolio and operations. And 3rd, we are seeing acute shortages in labor across all spectrum of the economy. This is resulting in absenteeism, high turnover, difficulty in attaining temporary labor, and for some of us, even labor strikes. To address this, we've had to recruit continuously, and we've executed contingency plans to sustain as much supply as possible in the face of open positions and work stoppages. Simply put, we are taking important actions to manage through today's unprecedented environment. And through it all, we're executing well in market and delivering balanced financial growth, which continued in quarter 3 and as discussed on Slide number 9. Consumption growth remains elevated, as measured on a 2-year compound annual growth basis, even if it continues to decelerate as expected. We're seeing particularly strong consumption growth and share performance, in many of our biggest world-class brands.  We continue to sustain strong momentum in our emerging markets. This momentum has been evident for the past few years, and reflects our improved geographic footprint, the strength of our portfolio, our efforts to broaden our offerings into affordable price points, and our local route-to-market and supply chains. From a financial standpoint, these factors led to continued balanced growth. Strong organic net sales growth.  Strong operating profit growth. Strong earnings per share growth. And cash flow that remains well above pre -COVID 2019 levels. So, in spite of all the operating challenges, we continue to deliver. and today we are even raising our full-year guidance for net sales to reflect momentum in the business. At the same time, we're also reaffirming our guidance for operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow despite a worsened cost and labor and supply environment. I'm sure you can appreciate that even holding guidance amidst these kinds of challenges speaks to the kind of dependability we strive for, regardless of business conditions. Let me now turn it over to Amit so we can take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail.\nAmit Banati: Thanks, Steve, and good morning everyone. Our financial results for the third quarter, are summarized on Slide number 11. As you can see, we delivered strong organic basis, net sales growth of 5% in quarter 3, on top of similar growth in the year earlier period. This came in better than anticipated due to exceptional growth in Europe and EMEA. Currency-neutral adjusted basis operating profit, increased by 11% year-on-year. This was driven by the strong top-line growth, as well as lapping a year-ago quarter, in which incremental brand-building investment had been shifted, from earlier quarters.  Currency-neutral adjusted-basis earnings per share increased by 18%. A strong operating profit growth was augmented by a decrease in average shares outstanding. And cash flow, while still below last year's unusual pandemic related search, remained well above the pre -pandemic 2019 level. In total, a very strong financial performance. Let's examine these results in a little more detail. We'll start with net sales on slide number 12. As you can see, the net sales growth in quarter 3 was driven by both volume and price mix. The 1% plus organic volume growth was driven by our international regions, most notably Europe and EMEA, where our Nigeria business had an exceptional quarter. This volume growth comes despite supply pressures, and lapping good year-ago growth.  Our 4% organic basis price mix, remains solidly positive in all 4 regions. The result of revenue growth management actions that we have been implementing, since the second half of last year, when input costs inflation began to accelerate. Finally, foreign currency translation was modestly favorable to net sales in quarter 3, decelerating from the first half as expected. So, through the first 9 months, you can see that on an organic basis, our net sales were up 3%, despite lapping the pandemic related surge, and they are up 5%, on our 2-year compound annual growth basis.  Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect sustained price mix growth, based on the revenue growth management actions we've taken. Though we are a bit more cautious on volume, given the current labor negotiations, and a prudent view towards decelerating at-home demand, and emerging markets growth. Moving down the Income statement, Slide number 13 shows our gross profit performance. As we had anticipated, both our gross profit and gross profit margin, declined year-on-year in quarter 3, as we lapped last year's strong operating leverage, and as we faced this year\u2019s unusually high-cost pressures.  While our productivity and revenue growth management actions continue to cobble, market-driven cost inflation there was significant incremental costs and disruption stemming from the current operating environment that came on top of that. Our gross profit margin was further weighed down by disruption and costs related to fire and one-off our plans and are more pronounced than usual mix shift towards the emerging markets. Most notably, our distributor business in Nigeria. Importantly though, while our gross profit percent margin decreased to below the level of pre -pandemic Q3 2019, our gross profit dollars remained higher than that period.  And if you look at the right-hand side of the slide, you can see that our gross profit dollars are up through the first 9 months of this year, both on a year-on-year [Indiscernible] on a 2-year basis In this high-cost environment, we have to focus on both margins and dollar growth. On Slide number 14, we see a driver of year-on-year profit change, that is really more of a phasing dynamic. SG&A expense is comprised of advertising and promotion, R&D, and ROI. Last year's quarter 3 was unusual, in that it included incremental A&P investment, delayed from the first half because of the pandemic. It also included a sizable increase in incentive compensation accruals.  But comparing SG&A to the third quarter of 2019, we see it was lower both on a percentage margin and dollar basis. This two-year decrease is related to both the work we did to remove stranded costs after our divestiture, but also to our decision detail to pull back on investment behind specific supply constrained brands. You can also see that through the first 9 months, our SG&A dollars are roughly flat with the same period of 2019. And that's probably how we'll finish the sale. If we look at operating profit in the same way, on slide number 15, we find that in dollars, our operating profit in this year's quarter 3 was not only higher than it was in last year's quarter 3, but also higher than what it was in quarter 3, 2019.  Again, this focus on dollar profit is important as we manage through this challenging environment. Now, we do think that quarter 4 will be a little different. Contrary to our prior assumptions, we are seeing no moderation of the economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages deal in the 4th quarter. In fact, we're now experiencing incremental disruption and costs further compounded by a labor strike. So, for quarter 4, we are forecasting gross profit dollars and operating profit dollars, to be below quarter 4 of 2019, even if both metrics finish the full-year above 2019 levels. Moving down the P&L, let's turn to Slide number 16. While operating profit drove most of our growth in earnings per share in quarter 3, we also benefited from modest net favorability in below the line items.  In quarter 3, interest expense decreased on lower debt, which will continue to be a year-on-year driver in quarter 4. With quarter 4 comparison also lapping, the 20 million debt redemption costs we recorded last year. This decrease in interest expense was more than offset by a decline in other income, which compared against an unusually high-level last year. We expect quarter 4s other income to be similar to that of quarter 3.  Our effective tax rate in quarter 3, came in lower than last year. We believe quarter 4s rate, will come in higher than the 22% rate we're now forecasting for the full-year. JV earnings and minority interest together were favorable to last year, though that mostly reflects the consolidation of a couple of our smaller investment phase joint ventures, invest Africa into operating profit. An average shares outstanding decrease year-on-year, reflecting the impact of quarter ones buybacks. We still expect full-year average shares outstanding to be around 0.5% lower than 2020. Outside of the currency-neutral EPS that we manage and guide to, we did experience continued year-on-year favorability, though modest, from foreign currency translation. Based on where exchange rates are today and what we're lapping, there will be little to no benefit from foreign currency translation in quarter 4.  Let's now discuss our cash flow and Balance Sheet shown on Slide number 17. Year-to-date, our cash flow remains below last year's unusually high level as expected. Mostly as we lapped last year's timing-related increases in various accruals during the height of the pandemic. The more relevant comparisons therefore, are the year-to-date periods of 2019 and 2018. As you can see from the slide, the sale cash flow continues to track well above those pre -COVID time periods.  This is driven by our operating profit, as well as reduced restructuring outlays and continued effective management of co-working capital. Meanwhile, our balance sheet remains solid. Net debt remains roughly even with last year, and lower than each of the prior two years. Even despite this year increase in cash return to share-owners in the form of resume share buybacks, and increased dividend. So, our financial condition remains quite strong. Slide number 18 shows where our results stand after the first 9 months of 2021. Obviously, we've had a good year so far producing strong and balanced financial results on a two-year basis, and staying ahead of our own internal focus.  This year-to-date performance is all the more impressive when you consider just how challenging the business environment has been. Let's now turn to our updated guidance for the full-year 2021 as shown on slide number 19. Given the better-than-expected momentum we are seeing in our international regions, we are raising our guidance organic net sales growth to a rate of 2% to 3%. This is a solid performance, particularly given the comparisons against last year's pandemic related search.  At the same time, we are reaffirming our guidance for currency-neutral adjusted basis, operating profit, and earnings per share, as well as for cash flow. While net sales are coming in higher than previously expected, we are incorporating costs and disruptions, related to the current supply, and labor conditions. In fact, given this current environment, we will likely land towards the lower end of the guidance ranges for these metrics. Our guidance assumes a reasonable conclusion, to the current labor stoppage at our U.S. cereal plants.  However, as you can appreciate, there is always uncertainty regarding labor negotiations. In the meantime, we will continue to execute our contingency plans to mitigate disruption. Overall, despite an incredibly challenging operating environment, we remain in strong financial condition and our full-year results are expected to sustain balanced financial delivery on a 2-year basis. And with that, let me turn it back to Steve for a review of our major businesses.\nSteven Cahillane: Thanks, Amit. I'll start by emphasizing the broad-based nature of our sales growth. Slide number 21 shows the 2-year compound annual growth rates in net sales across our 4 regions. It's in North America where we've had the most supply disruption and most significantly in cereal. This has restrained our overall growth in quarter 2 and quarter 3 this year. But as we'll see in a minute, our snacks continued to grow nicely year-on-year. And frozen breakfast and plant-based foods have continued to post good growth on a 2-year CAGR basis. Europe sustained impressive growth in quarter 3.  Pringles has driven exceptional growth for us in snacks, and cereal sales have remained strong there as well. In our Latin America and EMEA regions, we are clearly demonstrating exceptional momentum, collectively sustaining double-digit growth on a 2-year and 1-year basis in the third quarter. In fact, if you turn to slide number 22, you can see that this emerging markets growth is anything but new. Collectively, our emerging markets had already been growing consistently at or above our long-term target of mid-single-digit growth for these businesses. This year we've seen double-digit growth.  Elasticity to our cost-related price increases have run lower than historical levels. We have continued to expand Pringles across these markets, with especially strong growth in Russia and Brazil. We have also continued to grow cereal across our emerging markets, with particular strength this year in Asia. Our growth in Africa this year has been nothing short of spectacular, driven by noodles, cereal and snacks. Equally important to our long-term prospects, is the health of our big world-class brands.  In Q3, their momentum was sustained as much in developed markets, as an emerging markets. Slide 23 shows the two-year categories for consumption growth for Pringles in the U.S. This brand continued to gain share in the third quarter, propelled by incremental innovation, effective brand-building campaigns, and strength in multipacks. In slide number 24 shows that Pringles momentum is truly global. Similar to the U.S., the brand's strong growth and share performance is being driven by incremental innovation like Sizzl'n Platform in Europe, or local flavors like seaweed in Asia, and by various active brand-building, particularly its 360-degree campaigns around soccer and electronic gaming.  On top of that, it continues to gain distribution, particularly in emerging markets. So, this $2 billion global retail sales brand continues to perform well. Let's check-in on another world-class brands, Cheez-It shown on slide number 25. In the U.S. this brand continued to grow consumption and gain share in the third quarter, sparked by strong brand-building activity and growth in multi-packs. Meantime, it continues to gain distribution and share in its newly launched markets, Canada and Brazil.  This is a billion-dollar plus brand that continues its long track record of consistent growth. Pop-Tarts is another world-class brand that is performing well. It's 2-year growth has well outpaced the portable Wholesome Snacks category, as shown on Slide number 26. Another big brand with over $750 million sales at retail in the U.S. alone, it's showing good momentum. To give you an idea of how relevant this brand is, our latest ad has generated nearly 40 million views on YouTube. Our what-would-Pop-Tarts-do hashtag has shown up 5.7 billion times in TikTok, and the brand has enjoyed more than 2 billion earned impressions this year.  Big growth has continued for us on Rice Krispies Treats shown on slide number 27. This brand even accelerated its consumption growth and share gains during the third quarter, aided by effective brand-building and the success of innovation like Homestyle Treats. This brand generates close to $350 million in retail sales in the U.S. and it continues to grow. In cereal, the performance of key brands in the U.S. has been impacted by supply complications in North America, but internationally, we're seeing good growth. On slide number 28, our two world-class brands in Europe are worth highlighting. Tresor, also known as Krave in some markets, is a taste segment brand that has become the number 1 cereal brand in Europe, and has dramatically outpaced the category this year in key markets like France and Germany. Extra meanwhile is geared more towards adults, and it too has strongly outpaced the category this year in markets like Italy and Spain. Over in the frozen aisle, Eggo is clearly a world-class brand, and it is performing well.  Slide number 29 shows that it is sustaining solid mid-single-digit consumption growth in spite of capacity constraints. Yet another big brand with close to $900 million in retail sales in the U.S. continuing to grow. MorningStar Farms are leading plant-based proteins brand is shown on Slide number 30. This is another world-class brand and is sustaining strong consumption growth even as the category decelerates as expected, and even as we run up against capacity limits in some of our product segments.  This is a $400 million retail sales brand with momentum and strong prospects. In fact, as you've seen, the fundamentals momentum and growth prospects for many of our biggest world-class brands remains solid. Now let's review each of our regions, starting with North America in Slide number 31. Net sales were flat year-on-year in the third quarter, with underlying consumption growth well exceeding our shipments due to supply constraints. Many of these constraints were economy-wide, including shortages of materials, labor, and freight.  But we had some internal challenges as well. As you know we entered this year tight on capacity for growing food formats in cereal frozen from the [Indiscernible] and plant-based protein as well as certain pack formats and snacks. Add to that, the fire that interrupted production at one of our cereal plants. And you can appreciate just how constrained we have been. The good news is that we remain in growth on a 2-year CAGR basis, and that our revenue growth management actions are resulting in good price mix growth.  This price realization, along with good execution of productivity programs, is crucial for mitigating the margin pressures of high-cost inflation and incremental costs and inefficiencies related to the broader bottlenecks and shortages in the economy. Slide number 32 breaks our North America in net sales growth in the category groups. You can see the good momentum we've seen in snacks and frozen, despite these supply constraints and the fact that away from home sales remained lower on a two-year basis.  Cereal net sales have been flattish on a two-year category basis in the first half, roughly in line with the U.S. category's performance. In quarter 3 however it faced the worst of its supply challenges and is now down about 1% year-to-date on a two-year category basis. Importantly, our underlying consumption trends remained solid across most of the portfolio, as shown on slide number 33. In all 3 of our snacks categories, we saw an acceleration in two-year categories in quarter three. Continuing to well outpace their individual categories.  In the frozen, from the griddle category, we also saw accelerated 2-year growth during the third quarter, and in frozen veggie vegan, even as the category decelerates as expected, our growth remains strong. Even in cereal, which is a category has been flat on a two-year basis this year, we are holding consumption relatively flat despite all the supply challenges we've been facing. And before we move on from our discussion of North America, we should touch on our U.S. away-from-home business in slide number 34.  The slide shows rolling two-year average growth rates in our net sales over the past few quarters in these channels. As restrictions eased and consumer mobility increased, we saw year-on-year growth starting in quarter 2 and continuing in quarter 3. Our sales remained below 2019 levels, but you could see that a gradual recovery continues. The recovery has been a little quicker in channels like convenience stores and schools, and much lower in channels like vending and in travel and lodging.  There is no question that our North America region is facing the toughest of the global supply challenges, and the team has risen to the occasion. We are presently working to restore full production at our fire damaged cereal plants, while negotiating with the union regarding its strike against all of our U.S. cereal plants. Indeed, North America faces even tougher quarter, in the quarter 4. Nonetheless, we're executing well in market and our brands are in great shape. Now let's turn to our international regions and Slide number 35.  You can see that in each of these 3 regions, we are sustaining strong momentum, both in the form of year-on-year growth and on a 2-year CAGR basis, which eliminates the impact of comparing against last year's surge, especially in Latin America. Let's look at each of these regions a little more closely. Slide number 36 shows the results of Kellogg Europe. Europe streak of quarterly organic net sales growth continued impressive fashion in the third quarter.  Driven by both volume and price mix, this growth was led by Russia and the UK, but broad-based across the region. Double-digit growth in snacks was driven not only by Pringles sustaining its momentum, but also by a rebound in portable wholesome snacks. Cereal sales grew on top of last year's growth, and we are particularly pleased with the magnitude of our share gains in the UK. As we look to the fourth quarter, we lapped a particularly strong organic net sales growth performance, and on operating profit, we are managing through high costs and supply challenges, as well as lapping a 53rd week. Nevertheless, we expect to sustain our end-market momentum in cereal and snacks, and Europe is on track for another strong year. Now let's talk about Latin America in Slide number 37. The year-ago quarter included out-sized gains in sales and profit.  So, comparisons are masking a solid performance for us in the third quarter. Organic net sales continued to grow year-on-year, despite the comparisons with notable strength on a two-year CAGR basis. The growth was broad-based and supported by strong in-market performance in cereal, led by Mexico, as well as by Pringles across key markets. We saw particular strength in Brazil, where Pringles is showing outstanding momentum.  Despite decelerating at-home demand trends and extremely high-cost inflation, we expect Latin America to continue to grow in quarter 4, completing what has been a very strong year. And we'll finish our business review with EMEA in Slide number 38. Once again, we saw exceptional growth in this region. We generated organic net sales growth in Australia, led by cereal, and in Asia, driven by both cereal and snacks, despite COVID-related production restrictions on Pringles for much of the quarter.  The biggest star in the quarter was Africa, where we are generating double-digit growth in both volume and in price mix. The top-line growth was strong enough to overcome double-digit cost inflation, delivering operating profit growth. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect to see continued top-line momentum and bottom-line growth in EMEA, despite cost inflation, and supply challenges. Allow me to wrap up with a brief summary on Slide number 40. Our portfolio is in good shape.  Our world-class brands have great momentum and our emerging markets businesses continue to exceed even our expectations. The result is strong, top-line momentum. We're taking action to mitigate the profit impact of what is the highest cost inflation we've seen, in a decade or more. To do that, we're executing productivity initiatives, we're being disciplined on overhead, and selective on brand investment, and we're carefully executing all levers of revenue growth management.  Bottlenecks and shortages are ramping across the economy right now, and we're experiencing our own, particular labor and supply disruptions. However, we are managing well through these difficult supply conditions. Our people are demonstrating why there are competitive advantage, going the extra mile to supply the market when everything, procurement, manufacturing, shipping is more challenging now than ever. In the end, we expect to remain on our path of balanced financial growth.  We've delivered on its so far this year, and we are reaffirming our full-year guidance today, even in spite of the current operating environment. I want to commend and thank our entire organization for their dedication and GRIT and for finding a way to deliver on our commitments in what is obvious an unusual environment. And with that, we'd be happy to take any questions you might have.\nOperator: Thank you. As a reminder for anyone who does wish to ask a question [Operator Instructions]. And we do ask you ensure your line on too closely. Our first question today comes from Andrew. Andrew, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Lazar : Thanks. Good morning everybody.\nSteven Cahillane : Good morning Andrew.\nAndrew Lazar : Just one from me. Your Europe trend is obviously remaining incredibly strong and accelerated on a 2-year basis. Even as many of those markets have been reopening at a faster pace than we've seen here in the U.S. So, I guess what are the learnings, if any from Europe, maybe that can help you inform the debate a bit in the group on whether some of the new households gain the past 2 years can be somewhat more sticky over time as markets in the U.S. more fully reopen?\nSteven Cahillane : Yes. Thanks, Andrew. We have seen terrific growth in all of those international markets driven by increases in penetration and increases in buy rate. And so obviously those two things are important. They work in concert together and we've seen the business stick even as mobility has increased. And so, what we've always said is, we're looking at 2019 as a comparison, and obviously is still very relevant.  The U.S. continues to open up slowly and we're hanging onto those buy rates, especially in the U.S. And so, we anticipate, even as the U.S. continues to open up, what we've talked about is the lasting impact is something we're confident in. And as we've said, time and again, our goal all along was to exit the pandemic stronger than when we went in. And we're more confident than ever that that's happening. That's absolutely happening.\nAndrew Lazar : Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, please continue.\nStephen Powers : Thanks, and good morning from me as well. Two questions related to the supply of production backdrop in the U.S. First is can you give us some color on, how your service levels and fulfillment rates are holding up? How you expect them to trend for the fourth quarter and into the next -- into fiscal '22? Whether we should worry about, out-of-stocks accelerating or anything on that front? Relatedly, as you manage through these situations and you're pulling back, as you say, on investment spending, what's the risk as you see that begin to lose ground more structurally versus competition. I appreciate everyone's on the same boat directionally, but your situation is obviously a bit more severe at the moment. So, I'm wondering how you assess that risk. Thank you.\nSteven Cahillane : Yes. Thanks, Steve. So, as you pointed out, the environment is challenging for all of us, there is no question about that. Our fill rates and our customer service levels are not where we want them to be. And we're not alone in that either, but we hold ourselves to a very high standard and we aim to get better and better. And so, let me point out a couple of things around your question. We have one particular area that is more challenging than others, and that's our Cereal business.  And that's obviously been compounded because of the strike that we're going through right now. But outside of that, which is 20% of our global business, outside of that, we're in the same boat as everybody else and you can see based on the type of performance outside of cereal in the U.S., we have posted some very, very strong gains, so we don't believe there's going to be anything structural to our disadvantage as we continue to make our way through the pandemic, through the supply grid lock into a more normalized environment.  And we've got mitigation plans based on where we are with our current cereal plants in the U.S. as well. So, by no means are we complacent. We've got big challenges in front of us, but we're quite confident that we're not going to be at a long term or any kind of permanent disadvantage. This is a transitory event and we'll work our way through it.\nAmit Banati : And I think just on the investment levels, our investment levels are broadly flat versus a year ago, so while we pulled back on some supply constraint platforms, when I look at the overall level of investments, we're flattish. And in fact, our advertising is up, so we continue to invest at appropriate levels.\nStephen Powers : Okay. Very good. And just to -- Amit on that point just -- is that -- does that -- I think that's a regional statement. Does that apply to the U.S. cereal as well?\nAmit Banati : I think it would vary across category -- I think it would vary across categories because as Steve mentioned different categories, the supply and service levels vary by category. So, I was talking on a global level, on our levels of investment.\nSteven Cahillane : And really Steve, based on supply, we're not, we're not going to advertise and promote heavy areas that are severely constrains at the moment.\nStephen Powers : No, that makes sense. Just want to clarify. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Pam Kaufman of Morgan Stanley, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nPamela Kaufman : Hi. Good morning. I just had a question on -- I had a question on the guidance for the full year, so the full-year guidance implies a relatively wide range for Q4 top-line growth. Can you talk about the factors that would contribute to your results coming in towards the low versus the high end of the rates? And what impact are you expecting from the labor strike?\nSteven Cahillane : Hi Pamela, so I'll start and Amit can pick up. So, what we've said is, we're taking a reasonable approach to what we think will happen with the labor strike, and that's in our guidance. Our top-line, obviously, continues with great momentum. But you heard what we said about the other three elements coming in perhaps more towards the lower end of the guidance. So, let me talk about what our thinking behind the strike and what I can share with you. We are in the process of negotiating right now.  And so out of respect to that process, I'm not going to get into a lot of detail which I am sure you can appreciate. But we have always treated our employees with respect and fairness, and that includes industry-leading compensation and benefits. The offer that we have in front of the unit right now is increased compensation on top of that already industry-leading compensation and benefits, and we're not asking to take anything away, despite what you may have heard publicly. So, we think a fair resolution should be in the offing.  We think that this type of offer is fair, reasonable, and again, increases on top of the industry-leading compensation already. So, this would allow our employees to get back to work. We want them back to work. I think they want to be back to work. But because these negotiations are ongoing, we can't go into much more detail than that, but I think -- we're hoping that we'll come to a reasonable conclusion. And that's what we're working towards.\nPamela Kaufman : Great. And can you give more color on your growth margin expectations for the fourth quarter and how that will compare to the third quarter? And then just looking towards next year, do you think you've taken enough pricing and implementing enough productivity to preserve year-over-year gross margins?\nAmit Banati : Yes. So, I think just on gross margin, I think we expect quarter 4 to continue to be challenging from a cost standpoint. So, I think the environment remains challenging and we'd expect that to continue in fact, on certain packaging and in certain commodities, we expect inflation to be higher than what we've seen in quarter three. Overall, I would say that we're expecting inflation to be in the high single-digits.  Like it was quarter three similar levels, slightly higher in quarter four. And then of course, compounded by the strike, right? And the disruptions as a result of that. So that's the outlook on gross margins from quarter 4 standpoint. And I think as I mentioned in our in my prepared remarks, from an absolute dollar standpoint, we expect it to be higher for the full-year versus 2019 levels. So that's the outlook on gross profit.\nSteven Cahillane : And Pamela, on the pricing which you asked about we're not going to comment on forward-looking pricing for obvious reasons. But I think if you look at where we are with price mix and you look at what we've been able to accomplish, that would be our goal going into the future. So obviously the very cost, it's a very inflationary environment driving up costs. Our first line of defense is always productivity. And as we plan out 2022, we'll plan for the same levels of productivity or greater, and then look to the revenue growth management that we've successfully employed in order to protect our margins into next year.\nPamela Kaufman : Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Goldman of JP Morgan.\nKen Goldman : Hi, thanks so much. I know this is a difficult question to answer, so just trying to look for some rough ideas here, but there's the normal headwinds that every sort of food manufacturers is facing right now. When I say normal, I mean, the ones that are across the entire industry, whether it's labor challenges, logistics, or so forth, higher raw materials. And then there's the sort of Kellogg 's specific one of the strike.  And I'm just trying to get a better sense of as you look to your fourth quarter guidance and you think about early next year, how do we think about the impact on whether it's your gross margin or your EBITDA dollars, however you want to think about it on the labor strikes alone, I am just trying to get a sense of how to parse that out as we think about the headwinds there and any help you can give will be great.\nSteven Cahillane : Yes. Ken, I appreciate the question, but I think you can appreciate, based on the sensitivity of where we are, and the fact that we're in negotiations, we're not going to be able to quantify any of that. We've taken what we think is a very reasonable view of getting to an agreement. We've also taken into account the contingency plans that we have in effect. We knew -- we've been talking for a year now, because we had a year extension, we knew the contract was expiring on October 5th, so we took all sorts of measures to prepare ourselves, including building inventory.  Building inventory was a little bit challenge because of the fire in Memphis, but we also have deployed our white-collar workers, we've deployed outside labor to keep the plants running, to get the plants running, they're gaining productivity each and every day. We've also leveraged our global supply chain network for cereal to also mitigate. And so, we're working very, very hard on two fronts to mitigate the effects of the strike. On the one hand, and we're doing that successfully and getting better every day.  But also, to get our workers back to work. We want them to get their paychecks, we want them to enjoy their healthcare. We truly want them back to work and we think we've got a very, very good proposal. Again, with increases on top of already industry-leading compensation. So, I think reasonable heads should prevail, based on all that. And that's the view that we're taking. We want to get to a negotiated settlement, get back to work, and we think we've given the best guidance that we can based on all those different factors.\nKen Goldman : Thank you for that. And then a quick question follow-up just thinking about modeling on it. You've had similar adjusted SG&A the last couple of quarters, a little under $720 million. As we think about a run rate, going forward, is that a reasonable number? I know it's going to vary, obviously from quarter-to-quarter. I'm just trying to get a sense because we've had some ups from the last year. What we should be thinking about going ahead here.\nAmit Banati : Overall, I'd say flattish to 2019 levels is kind of a good run rate to assume Ken. I think the sales has been phasing. We're lapping the phasing of the brand-building and obviously we also lapping the incentive compensation accruals from last year.\nKen Goldman : Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.\nNik Modi : Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nSteven Cahillane : Morning, Nik.\nNik Modi : I was hoping maybe you can just -- good morning. I was hoping you can give us some context on inflation just kind of the key buckets in how you see that playing out. And then Steve, if I could throw in a question to you just strategically and philosophically, we're obviously seeing a lot of onetime events that are causing a lot of disruption of these one-time events feel like they just keep on happening. So, I wanted to get your thoughts on capex and doesn't make sense to just have a super cycle in the near-term, just to automate as much as possible and just really evolved the infrastructure to be ready for handling these tend to shock? Thanks.\nAmit Banati : Nick, just on the inflation, I think as we expected and as we had previously communicated, inflation came in at high-single-digit rates in quarter 3, it accelerated through the quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect it to further accelerate into quarter 4 as well. And we kind of look at it in two buckets. There's the market-driven costs in commodities like oil, dairy, ingredients, like rice, potatoes and packaging. And actually, packaging was the one where we saw significant acceleration in quarter 3. So that's -- we think inflation, fairly broad-based, I'd say, across our commodities.  And then of course, the operating environment continues to be challenged. Whether it's freight markets, whether it's ocean freight, whether it's labor shortages, as well as shortages across our suppliers, and our supply chain. So that's -- and I would expect a similar outlook for quarter four with slightly higher -- still in the high single-digit rates, but slightly higher levels of inflation into quarter four. And I think from a pricing standpoint and from a revenue growth management standpoint, we're obviously taking action and broadly, I'd say covering our commodity related costs and our direct costs. I think some of the disruptions are hard to predict. And so that's kind of the color on inflation.\nSteven Cahillane : And Nick, it's a really interesting question that you raised strategically, and I think for everybody, the pandemic has brought all sorts of different consequences, right? And it's almost an old joke by now, there's no pandemic playbook, but we've all had different challenges, some very common and some unique. Unique to us to obviously is a fire that we talked about, the strike that we're dealing with right now. So, there's clearly some uniqueness. But I think one thing that we are definitely looking towards is how we continue to grow. Because despite this, we've had lots of I wouldn't call it pockets, we've got real growth happening in most of our business that is very resilient, robust, and sustainable. But the future of work is clearly going to change and our capital plans over the next couple of years will reflect that. When I say the future of work, the obvious -- what happens in office environments, where work gets done, how work gets done, but then also, from a capacity standpoint, and how factories run, and where work gets done there, where product gets made to allow ourselves even more resiliency going forward is clearly something that is on the cards for us.\nNik Modi : Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Palmer of Evercore.\nDavid Palmer : Thanks. Good morning. You mentioned that in, I think it was answer to Ken 's question and the high-single-digit inflation in the fourth quarter. If input costs remain at these current levels and considering contracts and hedges rolling off, will the -- will COGS inflation slow in the first half of '22 or remain near those high-single-digit levels? And I have a quick follow-up.\nAmit Banati : Yeah. I think we'll obviously provide detailed guidance right in our quarter 4 earnings call in early February. I think to your question on from an inflation standpoint, I think on a planning basis, we're assuming that the high levels of inflation will persist for the foreseeable future. But I think that's what -- that's the assumption that we're working with. I think from a hedging standpoint, we have a continuous hedging process, so they continue to roll. So, we do not anticipate any sudden cliff at the start of the year. that said, obviously the hedges are rolling up at higher prices.  And so, from a lapped standpoint, the current hedges are higher than the hedges that are dropping off. And so all-in-all, we're planning for a high inflation environment in 2022. I think you don't from a shortages and disruption standpoint, that's harder to predict. But we are assuming that they will persist. And so, from a productivity standpoint and from our revenue growth management standpoint, we will be taking actions in '22 to offset them and continuing to drive balanced financial delivery.\nDavid Palmer : And thanks for that. And if we were to look back where we can almost, now, look at '21 with pretty good visibility, I would imagine. And if you were to look at the friction costs, COVID related, strike related, just put it all into one bucket and God willing, you'll be able to lap these friction costs with less friction in '22. But how would you say or estimate those friction costs have been a drag to your gross margins in 21, I'll pass it on.\nAmit Banati : Yeah. I think it's hard to model that because there's so much that's happened during the course of this year. I think and like I mentioned, from our '22 planning standpoint, we're assuming that the current environment is going to persist. And we're focused on productivity and pricing and revenue growth management actions, to try and offset those costs. And continue to drive balanced delivery.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim.\nLaurent Grandet : Yes. Good morning, everyone. And 2 questions. The first one is more follow-up actually. You said in your per remark, U.S. shipments were lagging behind consumption. So, what is the current level of inventory at retailers? And how it compares to rate should be. So that's the first question. The second one is really about Europe. It's from a strong gross in Europe this quarter were higher than what we expected.  And you mentioned in your pro-market performance was driven by the U.K. and Russia. So, could you please give us a bit more color there? There were so -- I mean, we heard about disruption and the neighboring that truck drivers into U.K. And are you seeing any kind of disruption there in the U.K? but also in shipments between the U.K and Europe? Thank you.\nSteven Cahillane : Yes. Thanks. Laurent, I'll start and then Amit can fill in as well. From a U.S. shipment standpoint, I would say shipments are lagging consumption probably mid-single digits is probably a reasonable assumption there. I'd say inventory levels across the whole landscape are low, obviously. It's been well-documented in all the supply chain challenges and disruptions and so forth. In terms of Europe, I mean Europe team continues to deliver at a very high level. And if you look at the UK and Russia performance, we highlighted that and if you look at across Pringles and Cereal and the Wholesome Snacks has bounced back, as we said as well. And so, it's really just high levels of execution, lapping a very strong performance last year and continued demand creation activities that have been very, very successful in terms of the disruptions, there clearly are disruptions.  They're not quite as acute as they are in the U.S., but they are real. There's friction also that has to do with Brexit. When you think about supply chain that is on Continental Europe, as well as the UK. We're working our way through that. You're seeing good results despite that. But the same issues around freight and truck drivers exist in the UK and in Continental Europe, but particularly the UK as they do in the U.S. as well.\nLaurent Grandet : Thank you. I'll pass it down. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse.\nRobert Moskow : Hi. One of your big competitors is talking about price increases beginning in January and snack. And there's a lot of [Indiscernible] food companies that are introducing new pricing. Can you talk a little bit about like what your plans are for pricing in 2022? What have you talked to the trade about so far? And then a quick follow-up?\nSteven Cahillane : Yes. Thanks, Rob, I appreciate the question, but we do not talk about forward pricing for a number of reasons. But again, if you look backwards and you see what we've done, we've been successful at driving pricing. The good news is elasticities have performed very well. They've been lower than historically. That was our expectation.  And I think a lot of expectations based on just the totality of the inflationary environment. And as we look to 2022, as we said, we'll deploy productivity, we'll deploy revenue growth management. And we'll look to be competitive in market and to create value and to provide for a plan that delivers balanced financial growth going forward.\nAmit Banati : And I think if you look at our -- quick look backwards, our price mix has been at around 4% and within that actually mix has been negative because of -- in this quarter, because of country mix. And so not only is that of -- not only the 4% offsetting the mix. But obviously the pricing is at a high level than that. So, it's coming through.\nRobert Moskow : Okay. My follow-up on plant-based. You said that the category is declining as you expected off of tough comps. Is there a risk that these declines continue into next year? When do you think it comes back to positive again?\nSteven Cahillane : Yeah, Rob, I think it does come back to positive next year. The lap is really what's occurring right now. And if you go back to see what happened 2 years ago. There was an enormous excitement around the new entrants. Lots of new distribution being built. Lots of doors, frozen doors, refrigerated doors being added. And so, we always anticipated, as we said, that the hurdle of that would be difficult. But when you look to consumer behavior, when you look to the consumer research we have, there's still a lot of enthusiasm and excitement around plant-based. And so, we think going into next year, you start to see healthier growth rates on a year-over-year basis because of those comps.\nRobert Moskow : Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel.\nChristopher Growe: Hi. Good morning.\nAmit Banati : Morning.\nChristopher Growe: Quick question for you on mix as you were talking to Rob there. Does lower mix at the revenue line mean lower mix at the profit line, whether it be gross profit or operating profit? So, is that a factor weighing on your gross margin as well?\nAmit Banati : Not necessarily. I think it's -- there are 2 factors in play at a high level. One is obviously your geographic mix. A Multipro, it does impact both NSP and gross margin because it's a distributor business. And obviously in quarter 3, like we -- like I mentioned, we had a huge quarter in Multipro in Nigeria, driven really by pricing to cargo inflation and volume growth was strong despite the significant pricing that came through. On that one, it flows through. I think on the categories, I'd say it's a lot more balanced between snacks and cereal.\nChristopher Growe: Okay. And then I had a second question just around pricing and two elements of that. One would be that you noted the Europe pricing to offset inflation, but some of these disruptions and supply chain challenges are -- have been an issue for your gross margin. As you, I think you noted as well that you expect those to continue next year.  So, does that mean that your pricing would be below whatever the total amount of inflation is next year if the supply chain challenges don't get better? And then if I could add to that, you talked about a low level of plasticity, especially in the emerging markets to pricing, does that push you to price even more there than what you would expect around the level of inflation in those markets? Thank you.\nAmit Banati : I think to the extent that we can focus the disruptions. I think it's hard to focus and that's been the challenge this year, because it's just common in so many unexpected places. I think to the extent that it's sustained and we're able to focus it. Obviously, that will go into the mix of how we offset through productivity and revenue growth management.  So, I think that's the way we're thinking about it. I think to the areas that we think that's going to persist, we'll obviously take actions to offset that. And I think on your point on emerging markets, yes, the volume has come through stronger than we had expected. And so, I think elasticities have been lower. No question.\nChristopher Growe: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.\nKen Zaslow : Good morning, everyone.\nAmit Banati : Good morning.\nSteven Cahillane : And good morning, Ken.\nKen Zaslow : Can you talk about the auctioneer\nJohn Renwick : Can you hear us?\nKen Zaslow : That you have with Pringles and where you think that the new markets will be. And when you think about it in a couple of years, how big you think this brand will be?\nSteven Cahillane : Yes, thanks, Ken. So, we're very excited about the Pringles momentum obviously. It's a great brand, it's highly differentiated. It handles innovation extremely well. It carries flavor, like no other snack. And so, we see continued growth in the markets where we are. It's got pretty good distribution countrywide. So, most of the growth is going to come from continuing to penetrate and increased by rates and household penetration in some of the developing markets. You've seen in Central Brazil and other emerging markets quite successfully so. And we put a couple of lines in our Brazilian plant for Pringles as well. The Malaysia plant has been running strong for us and that provides good growth opportunities across Asia. So, we think -- I'm not going to predict how big it can get, but it keeps getting bigger for sure and generating very solid growth for us.  The other thing I'd mention where we have a lot of opportunity from snack and expanding distribution Cheez-It, which doesn't have the same footprint as Pringles, not even close. And we've now launched in Canada and Brazil and it's done extremely well. So now, as we look to the globe, we look to brands like Cheez-It and even Pop-Tarts and others that would have global aspirations. And so, we continue to look at our Snacks portfolio as something very exciting with a lot of growth potential.\nKen Zaslow : My second question is, for the last couple of quarters, you've tried to temper the emerging markets growth. This is probably the first quarter you haven't done that. And you continue -- you actually sound a little bit more optimistic about the outlook emerging markets. Not that you haven't been optimistic, but you're not trying to taper off expectations on that. What are you seeing in emerging markets to give you increased confidence that maybe this is much more sustainable than you may have thought for the last 3 quarters to 4 quarters. And unless I misread what you're thinking. And I'll leave it there [Indiscernible].\nSteven Cahillane : [Indiscernible]. Ken, sorry. We do assume a slowdown in emerging markets in quarter four. And we've been -- we've been pleasantly very, I wouldn't say surprised, but they're great, great numbers that have been posted in the emerging markets. You look at the Africa business. And so, we don't plan on that sustaining, but have been very pleased with what's been achieved.\nAmit Banati : And I think if you looked at our prepared remarks, we talked about growth accelerating. We saw it all the way through last year, and it's further accelerated. So, we had double-digit growth through the year. Overall, it's been sustained through the year, through last year. And I think from a growth standpoint, we continue to see it as a growth opportunity.\nKen Zaslow : Appreciate it. Thanks\nJohn Renwick : Operator. Thanks, Ken. Operator, I believe we are at 10:30, which means we need to wrap it up. We'd like to thank everybody for their interest and their questions. And if you do have any follow-up questions, please do not hesitate to call us.\nSteven Cahillane : Thanks, everybody.\nAmit Banati : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This conference call has now concluded, and you may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steven Cahillane",
            "content": "Thanks, John. And good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are doing well. After all, we're still managing through a pandemic and still nowhere close to what any of us would call life as normal. This is certainly true from a business perspective as well. Therefore, we remain focused on keeping our employees safe and aiding our communities is more important than ever. We also continue to supply the world with food. But as we and all companies have discussed previously, this has gotten extremely challenging. Importantly, we remain on our strategy, deploy for balanced growth, which is depicted on Slide number 6.  This strategy continues to keep us on our path for steady, balanced financial returns for shareowners. We also continue to make progress on Better Days, our ESG-oriented program. A few Better Days highlights from quarter 3 are shared on Slide number 7. This remains a critical element of our strategy. A clear focus of management, and a part of the DNA of Kellogg Company. And we have not lost sight of this during the current pandemic and business environment. And there is no question that today's business environment is as challenging as we've ever seen it.  Our organization has risen to all of these challenges using creativity, skills, and work ethic to manage through them. Slide number 8, attempts to categorize these challenges into 3 basic buckets. First, we're all familiar with the surges and market prices for commodities, packaging, and freight, all the result of supply demand and balances that may take some time to work out. We're working hard to mitigate the margin impact s of these high costs.  From our active hedging program, which has given a strong visibility into our commodity costs, to mitigating cost pressures with productivity initiatives and revenue growth management actions. Second, by now, we're also all aware of the economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages, that are not only pushing costs higher, but are also making it very difficult to supply the market. Here's where our supply chains-controlled power approach has provided us agility and addressing shortages, and gaps, and materials, equipment, and land and ocean freight.  We've also taken actions to reduce complexity in our portfolio and operations. And 3rd, we are seeing acute shortages in labor across all spectrum of the economy. This is resulting in absenteeism, high turnover, difficulty in attaining temporary labor, and for some of us, even labor strikes. To address this, we've had to recruit continuously, and we've executed contingency plans to sustain as much supply as possible in the face of open positions and work stoppages. Simply put, we are taking important actions to manage through today's unprecedented environment. And through it all, we're executing well in market and delivering balanced financial growth, which continued in quarter 3 and as discussed on Slide number 9. Consumption growth remains elevated, as measured on a 2-year compound annual growth basis, even if it continues to decelerate as expected. We're seeing particularly strong consumption growth and share performance, in many of our biggest world-class brands.  We continue to sustain strong momentum in our emerging markets. This momentum has been evident for the past few years, and reflects our improved geographic footprint, the strength of our portfolio, our efforts to broaden our offerings into affordable price points, and our local route-to-market and supply chains. From a financial standpoint, these factors led to continued balanced growth. Strong organic net sales growth.  Strong operating profit growth. Strong earnings per share growth. And cash flow that remains well above pre -COVID 2019 levels. So, in spite of all the operating challenges, we continue to deliver. and today we are even raising our full-year guidance for net sales to reflect momentum in the business. At the same time, we're also reaffirming our guidance for operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow despite a worsened cost and labor and supply environment. I'm sure you can appreciate that even holding guidance amidst these kinds of challenges speaks to the kind of dependability we strive for, regardless of business conditions. Let me now turn it over to Amit so we can take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail. Thanks, Amit. I'll start by emphasizing the broad-based nature of our sales growth. Slide number 21 shows the 2-year compound annual growth rates in net sales across our 4 regions. It's in North America where we've had the most supply disruption and most significantly in cereal. This has restrained our overall growth in quarter 2 and quarter 3 this year. But as we'll see in a minute, our snacks continued to grow nicely year-on-year. And frozen breakfast and plant-based foods have continued to post good growth on a 2-year CAGR basis. Europe sustained impressive growth in quarter 3.  Pringles has driven exceptional growth for us in snacks, and cereal sales have remained strong there as well. In our Latin America and EMEA regions, we are clearly demonstrating exceptional momentum, collectively sustaining double-digit growth on a 2-year and 1-year basis in the third quarter. In fact, if you turn to slide number 22, you can see that this emerging markets growth is anything but new. Collectively, our emerging markets had already been growing consistently at or above our long-term target of mid-single-digit growth for these businesses. This year we've seen double-digit growth.  Elasticity to our cost-related price increases have run lower than historical levels. We have continued to expand Pringles across these markets, with especially strong growth in Russia and Brazil. We have also continued to grow cereal across our emerging markets, with particular strength this year in Asia. Our growth in Africa this year has been nothing short of spectacular, driven by noodles, cereal and snacks. Equally important to our long-term prospects, is the health of our big world-class brands.  In Q3, their momentum was sustained as much in developed markets, as an emerging markets. Slide 23 shows the two-year categories for consumption growth for Pringles in the U.S. This brand continued to gain share in the third quarter, propelled by incremental innovation, effective brand-building campaigns, and strength in multipacks. In slide number 24 shows that Pringles momentum is truly global. Similar to the U.S., the brand's strong growth and share performance is being driven by incremental innovation like Sizzl'n Platform in Europe, or local flavors like seaweed in Asia, and by various active brand-building, particularly its 360-degree campaigns around soccer and electronic gaming.  On top of that, it continues to gain distribution, particularly in emerging markets. So, this $2 billion global retail sales brand continues to perform well. Let's check-in on another world-class brands, Cheez-It shown on slide number 25. In the U.S. this brand continued to grow consumption and gain share in the third quarter, sparked by strong brand-building activity and growth in multi-packs. Meantime, it continues to gain distribution and share in its newly launched markets, Canada and Brazil.  This is a billion-dollar plus brand that continues its long track record of consistent growth. Pop-Tarts is another world-class brand that is performing well. It's 2-year growth has well outpaced the portable Wholesome Snacks category, as shown on Slide number 26. Another big brand with over $750 million sales at retail in the U.S. alone, it's showing good momentum. To give you an idea of how relevant this brand is, our latest ad has generated nearly 40 million views on YouTube. Our what-would-Pop-Tarts-do hashtag has shown up 5.7 billion times in TikTok, and the brand has enjoyed more than 2 billion earned impressions this year.  Big growth has continued for us on Rice Krispies Treats shown on slide number 27. This brand even accelerated its consumption growth and share gains during the third quarter, aided by effective brand-building and the success of innovation like Homestyle Treats. This brand generates close to $350 million in retail sales in the U.S. and it continues to grow. In cereal, the performance of key brands in the U.S. has been impacted by supply complications in North America, but internationally, we're seeing good growth. On slide number 28, our two world-class brands in Europe are worth highlighting. Tresor, also known as Krave in some markets, is a taste segment brand that has become the number 1 cereal brand in Europe, and has dramatically outpaced the category this year in key markets like France and Germany. Extra meanwhile is geared more towards adults, and it too has strongly outpaced the category this year in markets like Italy and Spain. Over in the frozen aisle, Eggo is clearly a world-class brand, and it is performing well.  Slide number 29 shows that it is sustaining solid mid-single-digit consumption growth in spite of capacity constraints. Yet another big brand with close to $900 million in retail sales in the U.S. continuing to grow. MorningStar Farms are leading plant-based proteins brand is shown on Slide number 30. This is another world-class brand and is sustaining strong consumption growth even as the category decelerates as expected, and even as we run up against capacity limits in some of our product segments.  This is a $400 million retail sales brand with momentum and strong prospects. In fact, as you've seen, the fundamentals momentum and growth prospects for many of our biggest world-class brands remains solid. Now let's review each of our regions, starting with North America in Slide number 31. Net sales were flat year-on-year in the third quarter, with underlying consumption growth well exceeding our shipments due to supply constraints. Many of these constraints were economy-wide, including shortages of materials, labor, and freight.  But we had some internal challenges as well. As you know we entered this year tight on capacity for growing food formats in cereal frozen from the [Indiscernible] and plant-based protein as well as certain pack formats and snacks. Add to that, the fire that interrupted production at one of our cereal plants. And you can appreciate just how constrained we have been. The good news is that we remain in growth on a 2-year CAGR basis, and that our revenue growth management actions are resulting in good price mix growth.  This price realization, along with good execution of productivity programs, is crucial for mitigating the margin pressures of high-cost inflation and incremental costs and inefficiencies related to the broader bottlenecks and shortages in the economy. Slide number 32 breaks our North America in net sales growth in the category groups. You can see the good momentum we've seen in snacks and frozen, despite these supply constraints and the fact that away from home sales remained lower on a two-year basis.  Cereal net sales have been flattish on a two-year category basis in the first half, roughly in line with the U.S. category's performance. In quarter 3 however it faced the worst of its supply challenges and is now down about 1% year-to-date on a two-year category basis. Importantly, our underlying consumption trends remained solid across most of the portfolio, as shown on slide number 33. In all 3 of our snacks categories, we saw an acceleration in two-year categories in quarter three. Continuing to well outpace their individual categories.  In the frozen, from the griddle category, we also saw accelerated 2-year growth during the third quarter, and in frozen veggie vegan, even as the category decelerates as expected, our growth remains strong. Even in cereal, which is a category has been flat on a two-year basis this year, we are holding consumption relatively flat despite all the supply challenges we've been facing. And before we move on from our discussion of North America, we should touch on our U.S. away-from-home business in slide number 34.  The slide shows rolling two-year average growth rates in our net sales over the past few quarters in these channels. As restrictions eased and consumer mobility increased, we saw year-on-year growth starting in quarter 2 and continuing in quarter 3. Our sales remained below 2019 levels, but you could see that a gradual recovery continues. The recovery has been a little quicker in channels like convenience stores and schools, and much lower in channels like vending and in travel and lodging.  There is no question that our North America region is facing the toughest of the global supply challenges, and the team has risen to the occasion. We are presently working to restore full production at our fire damaged cereal plants, while negotiating with the union regarding its strike against all of our U.S. cereal plants. Indeed, North America faces even tougher quarter, in the quarter 4. Nonetheless, we're executing well in market and our brands are in great shape. Now let's turn to our international regions and Slide number 35.  You can see that in each of these 3 regions, we are sustaining strong momentum, both in the form of year-on-year growth and on a 2-year CAGR basis, which eliminates the impact of comparing against last year's surge, especially in Latin America. Let's look at each of these regions a little more closely. Slide number 36 shows the results of Kellogg Europe. Europe streak of quarterly organic net sales growth continued impressive fashion in the third quarter.  Driven by both volume and price mix, this growth was led by Russia and the UK, but broad-based across the region. Double-digit growth in snacks was driven not only by Pringles sustaining its momentum, but also by a rebound in portable wholesome snacks. Cereal sales grew on top of last year's growth, and we are particularly pleased with the magnitude of our share gains in the UK. As we look to the fourth quarter, we lapped a particularly strong organic net sales growth performance, and on operating profit, we are managing through high costs and supply challenges, as well as lapping a 53rd week. Nevertheless, we expect to sustain our end-market momentum in cereal and snacks, and Europe is on track for another strong year. Now let's talk about Latin America in Slide number 37. The year-ago quarter included out-sized gains in sales and profit.  So, comparisons are masking a solid performance for us in the third quarter. Organic net sales continued to grow year-on-year, despite the comparisons with notable strength on a two-year CAGR basis. The growth was broad-based and supported by strong in-market performance in cereal, led by Mexico, as well as by Pringles across key markets. We saw particular strength in Brazil, where Pringles is showing outstanding momentum.  Despite decelerating at-home demand trends and extremely high-cost inflation, we expect Latin America to continue to grow in quarter 4, completing what has been a very strong year. And we'll finish our business review with EMEA in Slide number 38. Once again, we saw exceptional growth in this region. We generated organic net sales growth in Australia, led by cereal, and in Asia, driven by both cereal and snacks, despite COVID-related production restrictions on Pringles for much of the quarter.  The biggest star in the quarter was Africa, where we are generating double-digit growth in both volume and in price mix. The top-line growth was strong enough to overcome double-digit cost inflation, delivering operating profit growth. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect to see continued top-line momentum and bottom-line growth in EMEA, despite cost inflation, and supply challenges. Allow me to wrap up with a brief summary on Slide number 40. Our portfolio is in good shape.  Our world-class brands have great momentum and our emerging markets businesses continue to exceed even our expectations. The result is strong, top-line momentum. We're taking action to mitigate the profit impact of what is the highest cost inflation we've seen, in a decade or more. To do that, we're executing productivity initiatives, we're being disciplined on overhead, and selective on brand investment, and we're carefully executing all levers of revenue growth management.  Bottlenecks and shortages are ramping across the economy right now, and we're experiencing our own, particular labor and supply disruptions. However, we are managing well through these difficult supply conditions. Our people are demonstrating why there are competitive advantage, going the extra mile to supply the market when everything, procurement, manufacturing, shipping is more challenging now than ever. In the end, we expect to remain on our path of balanced financial growth.  We've delivered on its so far this year, and we are reaffirming our full-year guidance today, even in spite of the current operating environment. I want to commend and thank our entire organization for their dedication and GRIT and for finding a way to deliver on our commitments in what is obvious an unusual environment. And with that, we'd be happy to take any questions you might have. Good morning Andrew. Yes. Thanks, Andrew. We have seen terrific growth in all of those international markets driven by increases in penetration and increases in buy rate. And so obviously those two things are important. They work in concert together and we've seen the business stick even as mobility has increased. And so, what we've always said is, we're looking at 2019 as a comparison, and obviously is still very relevant.  The U.S. continues to open up slowly and we're hanging onto those buy rates, especially in the U.S. And so, we anticipate, even as the U.S. continues to open up, what we've talked about is the lasting impact is something we're confident in. And as we've said, time and again, our goal all along was to exit the pandemic stronger than when we went in. And we're more confident than ever that that's happening. That's absolutely happening. Yes. Thanks, Steve. So, as you pointed out, the environment is challenging for all of us, there is no question about that. Our fill rates and our customer service levels are not where we want them to be. And we're not alone in that either, but we hold ourselves to a very high standard and we aim to get better and better. And so, let me point out a couple of things around your question. We have one particular area that is more challenging than others, and that's our Cereal business.  And that's obviously been compounded because of the strike that we're going through right now. But outside of that, which is 20% of our global business, outside of that, we're in the same boat as everybody else and you can see based on the type of performance outside of cereal in the U.S., we have posted some very, very strong gains, so we don't believe there's going to be anything structural to our disadvantage as we continue to make our way through the pandemic, through the supply grid lock into a more normalized environment.  And we've got mitigation plans based on where we are with our current cereal plants in the U.S. as well. So, by no means are we complacent. We've got big challenges in front of us, but we're quite confident that we're not going to be at a long term or any kind of permanent disadvantage. This is a transitory event and we'll work our way through it. And really Steve, based on supply, we're not, we're not going to advertise and promote heavy areas that are severely constrains at the moment. Hi Pamela, so I'll start and Amit can pick up. So, what we've said is, we're taking a reasonable approach to what we think will happen with the labor strike, and that's in our guidance. Our top-line, obviously, continues with great momentum. But you heard what we said about the other three elements coming in perhaps more towards the lower end of the guidance. So, let me talk about what our thinking behind the strike and what I can share with you. We are in the process of negotiating right now.  And so out of respect to that process, I'm not going to get into a lot of detail which I am sure you can appreciate. But we have always treated our employees with respect and fairness, and that includes industry-leading compensation and benefits. The offer that we have in front of the unit right now is increased compensation on top of that already industry-leading compensation and benefits, and we're not asking to take anything away, despite what you may have heard publicly. So, we think a fair resolution should be in the offing.  We think that this type of offer is fair, reasonable, and again, increases on top of the industry-leading compensation already. So, this would allow our employees to get back to work. We want them back to work. I think they want to be back to work. But because these negotiations are ongoing, we can't go into much more detail than that, but I think -- we're hoping that we'll come to a reasonable conclusion. And that's what we're working towards. And Pamela, on the pricing which you asked about we're not going to comment on forward-looking pricing for obvious reasons. But I think if you look at where we are with price mix and you look at what we've been able to accomplish, that would be our goal going into the future. So obviously the very cost, it's a very inflationary environment driving up costs. Our first line of defense is always productivity. And as we plan out 2022, we'll plan for the same levels of productivity or greater, and then look to the revenue growth management that we've successfully employed in order to protect our margins into next year. Yes. Ken, I appreciate the question, but I think you can appreciate, based on the sensitivity of where we are, and the fact that we're in negotiations, we're not going to be able to quantify any of that. We've taken what we think is a very reasonable view of getting to an agreement. We've also taken into account the contingency plans that we have in effect. We knew -- we've been talking for a year now, because we had a year extension, we knew the contract was expiring on October 5th, so we took all sorts of measures to prepare ourselves, including building inventory.  Building inventory was a little bit challenge because of the fire in Memphis, but we also have deployed our white-collar workers, we've deployed outside labor to keep the plants running, to get the plants running, they're gaining productivity each and every day. We've also leveraged our global supply chain network for cereal to also mitigate. And so, we're working very, very hard on two fronts to mitigate the effects of the strike. On the one hand, and we're doing that successfully and getting better every day.  But also, to get our workers back to work. We want them to get their paychecks, we want them to enjoy their healthcare. We truly want them back to work and we think we've got a very, very good proposal. Again, with increases on top of already industry-leading compensation. So, I think reasonable heads should prevail, based on all that. And that's the view that we're taking. We want to get to a negotiated settlement, get back to work, and we think we've given the best guidance that we can based on all those different factors. Morning, Nik. And Nick, it's a really interesting question that you raised strategically, and I think for everybody, the pandemic has brought all sorts of different consequences, right? And it's almost an old joke by now, there's no pandemic playbook, but we've all had different challenges, some very common and some unique. Unique to us to obviously is a fire that we talked about, the strike that we're dealing with right now. So, there's clearly some uniqueness. But I think one thing that we are definitely looking towards is how we continue to grow. Because despite this, we've had lots of I wouldn't call it pockets, we've got real growth happening in most of our business that is very resilient, robust, and sustainable. But the future of work is clearly going to change and our capital plans over the next couple of years will reflect that. When I say the future of work, the obvious -- what happens in office environments, where work gets done, how work gets done, but then also, from a capacity standpoint, and how factories run, and where work gets done there, where product gets made to allow ourselves even more resiliency going forward is clearly something that is on the cards for us. Yes. Thanks. Laurent, I'll start and then Amit can fill in as well. From a U.S. shipment standpoint, I would say shipments are lagging consumption probably mid-single digits is probably a reasonable assumption there. I'd say inventory levels across the whole landscape are low, obviously. It's been well-documented in all the supply chain challenges and disruptions and so forth. In terms of Europe, I mean Europe team continues to deliver at a very high level. And if you look at the UK and Russia performance, we highlighted that and if you look at across Pringles and Cereal and the Wholesome Snacks has bounced back, as we said as well. And so, it's really just high levels of execution, lapping a very strong performance last year and continued demand creation activities that have been very, very successful in terms of the disruptions, there clearly are disruptions.  They're not quite as acute as they are in the U.S., but they are real. There's friction also that has to do with Brexit. When you think about supply chain that is on Continental Europe, as well as the UK. We're working our way through that. You're seeing good results despite that. But the same issues around freight and truck drivers exist in the UK and in Continental Europe, but particularly the UK as they do in the U.S. as well. Yes. Thanks, Rob, I appreciate the question, but we do not talk about forward pricing for a number of reasons. But again, if you look backwards and you see what we've done, we've been successful at driving pricing. The good news is elasticities have performed very well. They've been lower than historically. That was our expectation.  And I think a lot of expectations based on just the totality of the inflationary environment. And as we look to 2022, as we said, we'll deploy productivity, we'll deploy revenue growth management. And we'll look to be competitive in market and to create value and to provide for a plan that delivers balanced financial growth going forward. Yeah, Rob, I think it does come back to positive next year. The lap is really what's occurring right now. And if you go back to see what happened 2 years ago. There was an enormous excitement around the new entrants. Lots of new distribution being built. Lots of doors, frozen doors, refrigerated doors being added. And so, we always anticipated, as we said, that the hurdle of that would be difficult. But when you look to consumer behavior, when you look to the consumer research we have, there's still a lot of enthusiasm and excitement around plant-based. And so, we think going into next year, you start to see healthier growth rates on a year-over-year basis because of those comps. And good morning, Ken. Yes, thanks, Ken. So, we're very excited about the Pringles momentum obviously. It's a great brand, it's highly differentiated. It handles innovation extremely well. It carries flavor, like no other snack. And so, we see continued growth in the markets where we are. It's got pretty good distribution countrywide. So, most of the growth is going to come from continuing to penetrate and increased by rates and household penetration in some of the developing markets. You've seen in Central Brazil and other emerging markets quite successfully so. And we put a couple of lines in our Brazilian plant for Pringles as well. The Malaysia plant has been running strong for us and that provides good growth opportunities across Asia. So, we think -- I'm not going to predict how big it can get, but it keeps getting bigger for sure and generating very solid growth for us.  The other thing I'd mention where we have a lot of opportunity from snack and expanding distribution Cheez-It, which doesn't have the same footprint as Pringles, not even close. And we've now launched in Canada and Brazil and it's done extremely well. So now, as we look to the globe, we look to brands like Cheez-It and even Pop-Tarts and others that would have global aspirations. And so, we continue to look at our Snacks portfolio as something very exciting with a lot of growth potential. [Indiscernible]. Ken, sorry. We do assume a slowdown in emerging markets in quarter four. And we've been -- we've been pleasantly very, I wouldn't say surprised, but they're great, great numbers that have been posted in the emerging markets. You look at the Africa business. And so, we don't plan on that sustaining, but have been very pleased with what's been achieved. Thanks, everybody."

            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and good morning everyone. Our financial results for the third quarter, are summarized on Slide number 11. As you can see, we delivered strong organic basis, net sales growth of 5% in quarter 3, on top of similar growth in the year earlier period. This came in better than anticipated due to exceptional growth in Europe and EMEA. Currency-neutral adjusted basis operating profit, increased by 11% year-on-year. This was driven by the strong top-line growth, as well as lapping a year-ago quarter, in which incremental brand-building investment had been shifted, from earlier quarters.  Currency-neutral adjusted-basis earnings per share increased by 18%. A strong operating profit growth was augmented by a decrease in average shares outstanding. And cash flow, while still below last year's unusual pandemic related search, remained well above the pre -pandemic 2019 level. In total, a very strong financial performance. Let's examine these results in a little more detail. We'll start with net sales on slide number 12. As you can see, the net sales growth in quarter 3 was driven by both volume and price mix. The 1% plus organic volume growth was driven by our international regions, most notably Europe and EMEA, where our Nigeria business had an exceptional quarter. This volume growth comes despite supply pressures, and lapping good year-ago growth.  Our 4% organic basis price mix, remains solidly positive in all 4 regions. The result of revenue growth management actions that we have been implementing, since the second half of last year, when input costs inflation began to accelerate. Finally, foreign currency translation was modestly favorable to net sales in quarter 3, decelerating from the first half as expected. So, through the first 9 months, you can see that on an organic basis, our net sales were up 3%, despite lapping the pandemic related surge, and they are up 5%, on our 2-year compound annual growth basis.  Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect sustained price mix growth, based on the revenue growth management actions we've taken. Though we are a bit more cautious on volume, given the current labor negotiations, and a prudent view towards decelerating at-home demand, and emerging markets growth. Moving down the Income statement, Slide number 13 shows our gross profit performance. As we had anticipated, both our gross profit and gross profit margin, declined year-on-year in quarter 3, as we lapped last year's strong operating leverage, and as we faced this year's unusually high-cost pressures.  While our productivity and revenue growth management actions continue to cobble, market-driven cost inflation there was significant incremental costs and disruption stemming from the current operating environment that came on top of that. Our gross profit margin was further weighed down by disruption and costs related to fire and one-off our plans and are more pronounced than usual mix shift towards the emerging markets. Most notably, our distributor business in Nigeria. Importantly though, while our gross profit percent margin decreased to below the level of pre -pandemic Q3 2019, our gross profit dollars remained higher than that period.  And if you look at the right-hand side of the slide, you can see that our gross profit dollars are up through the first 9 months of this year, both on a year-on-year [Indiscernible] on a 2-year basis In this high-cost environment, we have to focus on both margins and dollar growth. On Slide number 14, we see a driver of year-on-year profit change, that is really more of a phasing dynamic. SG&A expense is comprised of advertising and promotion, R&D, and ROI. Last year's quarter 3 was unusual, in that it included incremental A&P investment, delayed from the first half because of the pandemic. It also included a sizable increase in incentive compensation accruals.  But comparing SG&A to the third quarter of 2019, we see it was lower both on a percentage margin and dollar basis. This two-year decrease is related to both the work we did to remove stranded costs after our divestiture, but also to our decision detail to pull back on investment behind specific supply constrained brands. You can also see that through the first 9 months, our SG&A dollars are roughly flat with the same period of 2019. And that's probably how we'll finish the sale. If we look at operating profit in the same way, on slide number 15, we find that in dollars, our operating profit in this year's quarter 3 was not only higher than it was in last year's quarter 3, but also higher than what it was in quarter 3, 2019.  Again, this focus on dollar profit is important as we manage through this challenging environment. Now, we do think that quarter 4 will be a little different. Contrary to our prior assumptions, we are seeing no moderation of the economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages deal in the 4th quarter. In fact, we're now experiencing incremental disruption and costs further compounded by a labor strike. So, for quarter 4, we are forecasting gross profit dollars and operating profit dollars, to be below quarter 4 of 2019, even if both metrics finish the full-year above 2019 levels. Moving down the P&L, let's turn to Slide number 16. While operating profit drove most of our growth in earnings per share in quarter 3, we also benefited from modest net favorability in below the line items.  In quarter 3, interest expense decreased on lower debt, which will continue to be a year-on-year driver in quarter 4. With quarter 4 comparison also lapping, the 20 million debt redemption costs we recorded last year. This decrease in interest expense was more than offset by a decline in other income, which compared against an unusually high-level last year. We expect quarter 4s other income to be similar to that of quarter 3.  Our effective tax rate in quarter 3, came in lower than last year. We believe quarter 4s rate, will come in higher than the 22% rate we're now forecasting for the full-year. JV earnings and minority interest together were favorable to last year, though that mostly reflects the consolidation of a couple of our smaller investment phase joint ventures, invest Africa into operating profit. An average shares outstanding decrease year-on-year, reflecting the impact of quarter ones buybacks. We still expect full-year average shares outstanding to be around 0.5% lower than 2020. Outside of the currency-neutral EPS that we manage and guide to, we did experience continued year-on-year favorability, though modest, from foreign currency translation. Based on where exchange rates are today and what we're lapping, there will be little to no benefit from foreign currency translation in quarter 4.  Let's now discuss our cash flow and Balance Sheet shown on Slide number 17. Year-to-date, our cash flow remains below last year's unusually high level as expected. Mostly as we lapped last year's timing-related increases in various accruals during the height of the pandemic. The more relevant comparisons therefore, are the year-to-date periods of 2019 and 2018. As you can see from the slide, the sale cash flow continues to track well above those pre -COVID time periods.  This is driven by our operating profit, as well as reduced restructuring outlays and continued effective management of co-working capital. Meanwhile, our balance sheet remains solid. Net debt remains roughly even with last year, and lower than each of the prior two years. Even despite this year increase in cash return to share-owners in the form of resume share buybacks, and increased dividend. So, our financial condition remains quite strong. Slide number 18 shows where our results stand after the first 9 months of 2021. Obviously, we've had a good year so far producing strong and balanced financial results on a two-year basis, and staying ahead of our own internal focus.  This year-to-date performance is all the more impressive when you consider just how challenging the business environment has been. Let's now turn to our updated guidance for the full-year 2021 as shown on slide number 19. Given the better-than-expected momentum we are seeing in our international regions, we are raising our guidance organic net sales growth to a rate of 2% to 3%. This is a solid performance, particularly given the comparisons against last year's pandemic related search.  At the same time, we are reaffirming our guidance for currency-neutral adjusted basis, operating profit, and earnings per share, as well as for cash flow. While net sales are coming in higher than previously expected, we are incorporating costs and disruptions, related to the current supply, and labor conditions. In fact, given this current environment, we will likely land towards the lower end of the guidance ranges for these metrics. Our guidance assumes a reasonable conclusion, to the current labor stoppage at our U.S. cereal plants.  However, as you can appreciate, there is always uncertainty regarding labor negotiations. In the meantime, we will continue to execute our contingency plans to mitigate disruption. Overall, despite an incredibly challenging operating environment, we remain in strong financial condition and our full-year results are expected to sustain balanced financial delivery on a 2-year basis. And with that, let me turn it back to Steve for a review of our major businesses. And I think just on the investment levels, our investment levels are broadly flat versus a year ago, so while we pulled back on some supply constraint platforms, when I look at the overall level of investments, we're flattish. And in fact, our advertising is up, so we continue to invest at appropriate levels. I think it would vary across category -- I think it would vary across categories because as Steve mentioned different categories, the supply and service levels vary by category. So, I was talking on a global level, on our levels of investment. Yes. So, I think just on gross margin, I think we expect quarter 4 to continue to be challenging from a cost standpoint. So, I think the environment remains challenging and we'd expect that to continue in fact, on certain packaging and in certain commodities, we expect inflation to be higher than what we've seen in quarter three. Overall, I would say that we're expecting inflation to be in the high single-digits.  Like it was quarter three similar levels, slightly higher in quarter four. And then of course, compounded by the strike, right? And the disruptions as a result of that. So that's the outlook on gross margins from quarter 4 standpoint. And I think as I mentioned in our in my prepared remarks, from an absolute dollar standpoint, we expect it to be higher for the full-year versus 2019 levels. So that's the outlook on gross profit. Overall, I'd say flattish to 2019 levels is kind of a good run rate to assume Ken. I think the sales has been phasing. We're lapping the phasing of the brand-building and obviously we also lapping the incentive compensation accruals from last year. Nick, just on the inflation, I think as we expected and as we had previously communicated, inflation came in at high-single-digit rates in quarter 3, it accelerated through the quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect it to further accelerate into quarter 4 as well. And we kind of look at it in two buckets. There's the market-driven costs in commodities like oil, dairy, ingredients, like rice, potatoes and packaging. And actually, packaging was the one where we saw significant acceleration in quarter 3. So that's -- we think inflation, fairly broad-based, I'd say, across our commodities.  And then of course, the operating environment continues to be challenged. Whether it's freight markets, whether it's ocean freight, whether it's labor shortages, as well as shortages across our suppliers, and our supply chain. So that's -- and I would expect a similar outlook for quarter four with slightly higher -- still in the high single-digit rates, but slightly higher levels of inflation into quarter four. And I think from a pricing standpoint and from a revenue growth management standpoint, we're obviously taking action and broadly, I'd say covering our commodity related costs and our direct costs. I think some of the disruptions are hard to predict. And so that's kind of the color on inflation. Yeah. I think we'll obviously provide detailed guidance right in our quarter 4 earnings call in early February. I think to your question on from an inflation standpoint, I think on a planning basis, we're assuming that the high levels of inflation will persist for the foreseeable future. But I think that's what -- that's the assumption that we're working with. I think from a hedging standpoint, we have a continuous hedging process, so they continue to roll. So, we do not anticipate any sudden cliff at the start of the year. that said, obviously the hedges are rolling up at higher prices.  And so, from a lapped standpoint, the current hedges are higher than the hedges that are dropping off. And so all-in-all, we're planning for a high inflation environment in 2022. I think you don't from a shortages and disruption standpoint, that's harder to predict. But we are assuming that they will persist. And so, from a productivity standpoint and from our revenue growth management standpoint, we will be taking actions in '22 to offset them and continuing to drive balanced financial delivery. Yeah. I think it's hard to model that because there's so much that's happened during the course of this year. I think and like I mentioned, from our '22 planning standpoint, we're assuming that the current environment is going to persist. And we're focused on productivity and pricing and revenue growth management actions, to try and offset those costs. And continue to drive balanced delivery. And I think if you look at our -- quick look backwards, our price mix has been at around 4% and within that actually mix has been negative because of -- in this quarter, because of country mix. And so not only is that of -- not only the 4% offsetting the mix. But obviously the pricing is at a high level than that. So, it's coming through. Morning. Not necessarily. I think it's -- there are 2 factors in play at a high level. One is obviously your geographic mix. A Multipro, it does impact both NSP and gross margin because it's a distributor business. And obviously in quarter 3, like we -- like I mentioned, we had a huge quarter in Multipro in Nigeria, driven really by pricing to cargo inflation and volume growth was strong despite the significant pricing that came through. On that one, it flows through. I think on the categories, I'd say it's a lot more balanced between snacks and cereal. I think to the extent that we can focus the disruptions. I think it's hard to focus and that's been the challenge this year, because it's just common in so many unexpected places. I think to the extent that it's sustained and we're able to focus it. Obviously, that will go into the mix of how we offset through productivity and revenue growth management.  So, I think that's the way we're thinking about it. I think to the areas that we think that's going to persist, we'll obviously take actions to offset that. And I think on your point on emerging markets, yes, the volume has come through stronger than we had expected. And so, I think elasticities have been lower. No question. Good morning. And I think if you looked at our prepared remarks, we talked about growth accelerating. We saw it all the way through last year, and it's further accelerated. So, we had double-digit growth through the year. Overall, it's been sustained through the year, through last year. And I think from a growth standpoint, we continue to see it as a growth opportunity. Thank you."

At this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for Kellogg Company. Mr. Renwick, you may begin your conference call.\nJohn Renwick: Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for a review of our second quarter 2021 results as well as an update regarding our outlook for the full year 2021. I'm joined this morning by Steve Cahillane, our Chairman and CEO; and Amit Banati, our Chief Financial Officer. Slide 3 shows our forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware, certain statements made today such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to this third slide of the presentation as well as to our public SEC filings. This is a particular note during the current COVID-19 pandemic when the length and severity of the crisis and resultant economic and business impacts are so difficult to predict. A recording of today's webcast and supporting documents will be archived for at least 90 days on the Investor page of kelloggcompany.com. As always, when referring to our results and outlook, unless otherwise noted, we will be referring to them on an organic basis for net sales and on a currency-neutral adjusted basis for operating profit and earnings per share. And now I'll turn it over to Steve.\nSteven Cahillane: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are doing well. There is no question that we're still managing through a pandemic. In this environment, keeping employees safe remains job number one. And aiding our communities is more important than ever. We also continue to supply the world with food, though, this remains challenging as the pandemic persists. A reacceleration of COVID cases has brought on new restrictions, causing temporary shutdowns of production in some countries. Meantime, we and the vendors that supply us are having to manage through bottlenecks and shortages of materials, labor and freight, all created by demand-supply imbalances that are also pushing up costs. So 2021 is shaping up to be anything but business as usual, and I'm extremely proud of how our organization continues to persevere and succeed in such challenging conditions. I'm also pleased with how well we continue to execute against our strategy, deployed for balanced growth, which is depicted on Slide 6. From a business perspective, demand and eating occasions at home remained elevated in quarter two, but they are gradually shifting as consumer mobility returns. In the second quarter, this was reflected in an ads forecast continuation of decelerating at-home demand growth, as measured by 2-year compound annual growth rates in our cereal and frozen categories around the world. We also saw signs of gradual recovery in away-from-home channels in an on-the-go snacks and pack formats. These channels grew year-on-year and better than forecast, even if they remain below 2019 levels. Our Deploy for Growth boosters are working effectively from focusing on ever-evolving occasions, to leveraging our reshaped portfolio, to driving momentum in our world-class brands and to investing in our supply chain to better serve our customers. Our Better Days boosters, which further our ESG efforts continue to work effectively as well. A few Better Days highlights are shared on Slide 7. During the second quarter, we continued to progress toward our ongoing Better Days commitments. This slide calls out a few of our actions and achievements of the quarter. The key message is that this remains a critical element of our strategy, a clear focus of management and a part of the DNA of Kellogg Company.  And we turned in another quarter of strong business performance in the second quarter, as discussed on Slide 8. Overall, at-home demand remained elevated, and we saw continued recovery in our away-from-home channels. Most encouraging has been the momentum demonstrated by key long-term growth engines for us. Our world-class snacks brands sustained their momentum with many continuing to outpace their respective categories. Our plant-based protein business is continuing to show strong growth. Our emerging markets businesses sustained their rapid growth and continue to excel even amidst challenging business conditions. Meanwhile, we continue to manage through the global supply challenges, I referred to earlier even as we continue to bring on our planned capacity increases. From a financial standpoint, our second quarter continued the balanced delivery that we returned to in 2020. Specifically, comparing to pre-COVID 2019, we realized another quarter of strong organic top line growth and operating profit growth as well as improved cash flow generation. We are affirming our full year guidance today. Like so many others, we are currently facing increased cost inflation and supply hurdles, and that is factored into our second half assumptions. Nonetheless, the business is showing good momentum. And just as we work through these challenges in the second quarter, we're confident we can work through them in the second half as well. Let me now turn it over to Amit, so he can take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail.\nAmit Banati: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Our financial results for the second quarter are summarized on Slide 10. It was another strong quarter that's viewed on a 2-year basis, because of the unusual period we were lapping from last year. On an organic basis, we nearly matched last year's unusually high net sales, generating 4.5% growth on a 2-year compound annual growth rate or CAGR basis. This came in better than expected, thanks to an impressive momentum in emerging markets and faster improvement than expected in our away-from-home channels. Currency-neutral adjusted-basis operating profit declined against last year's exceptional quarter when it grew 27% despite losing about 8 points to divestiture impact. Excluding those divested businesses from the 2019 base, our operating profit in quarter two this year grew at a 2-year CAGR of about 8%. This is strong growth that indicates underlying margin expansion. Currency-neutral adjusted-basis earnings per share declined as it lapped last year's outsized growth, but it grew about 9% on a 2-year CAGR basis, excluding the divestiture impact on operating profit. And cash flow was again stronger than anticipated for the quarter. And while it lapped last year's unusually high level, this cash flow was again higher than that of quarter two of 2019. So on a 2-year basis, we saw another quarter of good top line growth, margin expansion and conversion of profit into cash flow. That's the kind of balance we strive for. Let's examine these results in a little more detail. We'll start with net sales on Slide 11. Net sales remained strong despite tough comparisons. Volume declined against last year's double-digit surge, but remained up on a 2-year basis, even despite an as-expected reversal of shipment timing from quarter one in North America. Price/mix was again an important driver. Once again, most of this price/mix growth came from revenue growth management initiatives implemented in all 4 regions. Mix was only slightly positive as a mix shift towards Snacks was partially offset by resumed mix shift towards Multipro, our West African distributor business. Our 2-year organic net sales CAGR was 4.5% in quarter two, a very strong performance. Rounding out net sales, foreign currency translation was again positive in quarter two. As we look to the rest of the year, we assume continued deceleration in at-home demand with moderation in away-from-home declines being more modest due to the mix of our channels. We've seen this reflected in our 2-year CAGRs from quarter one to quarter two, and we expect this deceleration to continue into quarter three and quarter four. And based on where forex rates are right now, we would expect to see a less positive impact on net sales in the second half. Moving down the income statement. Slide 12 shows two important drivers of our profit margin performance. As you know, our gross profit margin in quarter two was lapping outsized operating leverage in quarter two, 2020, when our plants ran flat out, producing only a limited lineup of SKUs. But importantly, our gross margin in quarter two, as in quarter one, increased from 2019 levels. Productivity and price realization drove this 2-year improvement, more than overcoming high cost inflation, labor and freight disruptions, COVID-related costs and a mix shift towards emerging markets. So this 2-year improvement is very encouraging. As we'll talk about in a moment, we expect to see more pressure on gross margin in the second half than we did in the first half, reflecting the current operating and cost environment. Operating profit margin remained higher than quarter two, 2019 as well. This reflects the gross margin performance and good discipline on overhead. Brand building investment, while up double digits against last year's delays, was up more modestly versus 2 years ago. As we look to the second half, our SG&A expense may provide some offset to the gross margin pressure. SG&A expense in the second half should moderate year-on-year. Not only because of last year's back-weighted brand building, particularly in quarter four, but also because of lapping last year's incentive compensation. This could be partially offset by a gradual resumption of travel and related activities as economies reopen. Moving down the P&L. Let's turn to Slide 13. During quarter two, interest expense decreased year-on-year on lower debt, and this decrease will continue for the remainder of the year, with quarter four additionally lapping the $20 million debt redemption cost we recorded last year. Of note, during the quarter, we issued our first ever sustainability bond, which was very well received. Other income increased modestly year-on-year to a level that is a little higher than we would expect for the remaining quarters, owing to favorability in various nonpension items. Our effective tax rate of 22.6% was essentially in line with our full year forecast rate. JV earnings and minority interest together were roughly in line with last year. And average shares outstanding decreased year-on-year, reflecting the impact of quarter one's buybacks. We still expect full year average shares outstanding to be around 0.5% lower than 2020. Let's now discuss our cash flow and balance sheet shown on Slide 14. Year-to-date, our cash flow remains below last year's unusually high level as expected, but well above that of the first half of 2019. This 2-year increase is driven by our improved operating profit and improved cash flow conversion. We finished the first half ahead of our expectations for cash flow. And as we look to the rest of the year, cash flow should remain below last year's COVID-aided levels, but still well above 2019. Meanwhile, our balance sheet remains solid. Net debt remains roughly even with last year and lower than each of the prior 2 years, even despite our increase in cash return to shareowners in form of resumed share buybacks and increased dividend. So our financial condition is quite strong. Slide 15 shows where our results stand after the first 6 months of 2021. Obviously, we've had a good year so far, producing strong and balanced financial results on a 2-year basis and staying modestly ahead of our own internal forecast. This strong start is all the more important when you consider just how much more challenging the business environment has gotten lately. Now let's discuss our full year guidance shown on Slide 16. As Steve mentioned, we are affirming our overall guidance. Within that guidance, we are raising our net sales guidance. We are now calling for organic growth of flat to up to 1%, which is a bit higher than our previous guidance for flat, reflecting our business momentum, particularly in emerging markets. This equates to almost 3% growth on a 2-year CAGR basis. Volume will continue to lap last year's large gains but price/mix will remain positive as we execute revenue growth management actions to cover higher input costs. Our guidance for currency-neutral adjusted operating profit is unchanged, still calling for a year-on-year decrease of about 1% to 2%, equating to almost 4% growth on a 2-year CAGR basis, excluding the divestiture impact. This reflects our stronger-than-expected quarter two profit and raised full year net sales outlook, balanced by increased cost pressures and operating challenges that make us a bit more cautious about the second half. Specifically, we have the productivity and revenue growth management actions in place to continue to cover high market-driven cost for commodities and freight. However, the economy-wide supply chain challenges, that Steve mentioned, are impeding production and shipping and creating incremental operating costs as well, particularly in quarter three. Because of this, we now expect gross profit margin to finish 2021 slightly below 2019 levels, but well above 2019 in gross profit dollars. We are also affirming our guidance for 1% to 2% growth in currency-neutral adjusted earnings per share, which equates to almost 5% growth on a 2-year CAGR basis. And we continue to look for cash flow to finish the year in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. This outlook balances the momentum in our business with the challenging operating environment and balances our margin protection actions against heightened cost pressures. To summarize, we remain in strong financial condition, and we remain solidly on track for continued balanced financial delivery on a 2-year basis. And with that, let me turn it back to Steve for a review of our major businesses.\nSteven Cahillane: Thanks, Amit. Before we get into each of the 4 regions, let me start off by highlighting the strength of some of our most important growth drivers. The first is Pringles, shown on Slide 18. This $2 billion global retail sales brand continues to perform well around the world. Here in the United States, it continued to outpace the category on consumption growth using a 2-year CAGR to eliminate uneven comparisons. It's also outperforming the category on household penetration gains since the pandemic. And around the world, we are seeing similar momentum. We're seeing growth in original and core flavors. We're seeing incremental growth from innovations like Scorchin and Sizzl'n. Equally impressive has been Cheez-It, another world-class brand, shown on Slide 19. This $1 billion retail sales brand continues to perform well in the U.S. Its 2-year CAGRs remain well ahead of the category's growth and its household penetration has grown in contrast to the rest of the category. Meanwhile, our launches of this power brand into Canada and Brazil are off to strong starts. Let's not overlook 2 other world-class snack brands. On Slide 20, we can see the continued strength of Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Treats. Together, these 2 power brands represent $1 billion in measured channel retail sales in the U.S. alone. You can see from the slide that they are in terrific shape as well. Their consumption has continued to outpace the portable wholesome snacks category on a 2-year CAGR basis, and these brands have added households since the pandemic, whereas the overall category has not. Plant-based protein and our leading MorningStar Farms brand is another growth driver that is performing very well. As shown on Slide 21, this $400 million retail sales brand continues to show strong consumption growth on a 2-year CAGR basis and has continued to add to its household penetration. A key advantage of MorningStar Farms is the breadth of its offerings across product types. And in Q2, we continued to see double-digit 2-year CAGRs across segments like chicken, appetizers, breakfast meat and sausages. We continue to innovate against this brand, including its sub-brand Incogmeato, which continues to add distribution and share and is proving to be incremental to the MorningStar Farms franchise. MorningStar Farms growth has bumped up against our capacity at various times in the past year, even as it has faced numerous new entrants into the category. This is creating a lot of excitement in the category, and we are pleased with our momentum and prospects. And of course, there's Eggo, shown on Slide 22. This $900 million retail sales brand continues to perform well in the U.S. as indicated by its strong 2-year compound annual growth in consumption and by its better-than-category performance on household penetration. Meantime, the brand continues to grow on a 2-year basis in Canada and Mexico as well. Our emerging markets are another key growth driver for us. And as you can see on Slide 23, they have actually accelerated their growth over the past couple of years. As we've discussed many times, this is a testament to our geographic footprint, our portfolio of foods and brands, our local supply chains, our go-to-market and our experienced management teams. As you can see from the chart, we continued to record impressive growth in these markets in Q2, even in spite of challenges related to COVID. We grew strongly in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Russia, and we continue to grow in cereal, snacks and noodles. Emerging markets represent more than 20% of our net sales and are expected to remain an important growth driver for a long time to come. So some of our portfolio's most important growth drivers are very clearly showing good momentum and have only strengthened over the past year. And these aren't small businesses. Even just the ones I discussed here, collectively represent more than half of our company's net sales. Let's now discuss each of our regions. We'll start with North America in Slide 24. We sustained net sales growth on a 2-year basis in North America, even if that growth rate was held back by the pandemic's negative impact on away-from-home channels and on-the-go pack formats. Moreover, versus last year, our volume in Q2 was not only lapping last year's double-digit surge, but also felt the impact of our previously discussed shift of shipments into Q1 and resultant trade inventory coming out as expected during Q2. Importantly though, we realized good price mix growth driven by revenue growth management actions. And our overall sales growth was supported by good underlying consumption trends. We outpaced 4 of our 6 primary categories on a 2-year compound annual growth basis with our 2-year consumption growth accelerating sequentially from Q1 in 5 of our 6 categories. And as we discussed on the past few slides, this strong performance is being driven by many of our biggest brands. So the underlying fundamentals look good. On operating profit, remember that we were lapping a year ago quarter in which operating profit grew 36%, excluding divestiture impact, an unusually strong quarter elevated by at-home demand, outsized operating leverage and delayed brand investment during the height of the pandemic. On a 2-year CAGR basis though, you can see we continued to generate good operating profit growth driven by top line growth, productivity and price/mix. These have been able to offset the impacts of extremely high cost inflation this year as well as the frequent shortages of materials, freight and labor, which are most pronounced in North America. Let's take a closer look at our category groups in North America. Slide 25 shows that our net sales for snacks in North America continued to grow both on a 1-year and a 2-year CAGR basis, despite declines in away-from-home channels and many on-the-go foods and pack formats. U.S. consumption remains solid on a 2-year CAGR basis, outpacing all 3 of our snacks categories and led by power brands. In crackers, we outpaced the category on a 1-year and 2-year CAGR basis, led by continued strength in Cheez-IT and Club. In salty snacks, we outpaced the category on a 1-year and 2-year CAGR basis as well due to continued strength in Pringles, particularly its core 4 flavors, its new Scorchin innovation and multi-packs. And in portable wholesome snacks, we are seeing brands like Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Treats hold up very well on a 2-year CAGR basis, while also starting to see signs of recovery in our more on-the-go oriented brands, like Special K, Nutri-Grain and RXBARs.  In North America cereal, shown on Slide 26, organic net sales were off slightly on a 2-year CAGR basis due to declines in away-from-home channels. We also saw the impact of being capacity constrained on certain brands. In the U.S., the category's consumption was flat on a 2-year CAGR basis in Q2. And after being down about 1% in Q1, we improved to flat in Q2, keeping up with the category on that basis. Frosted Flakes accounted for most of the share decline related to pulling back on brand building and merchandising since Q4 last year, as we worked to maintain service levels and add capacity planned prior to the pandemic. Unfortunately, our capacity expansion has been slowed by current supply shortages and by our recent fire in one of our facilities. This will delay our return to normal commercial activity on affected brands. In the meantime, our business continues to progress well. We continue to lead the category and share of innovation, and we are seeing better performance in wellness-oriented brands, like Raisin Bran, Special K, Kashi and Bear Naked. And on Slide 27, we can see that our 2 frozen businesses, plant-based foods and frozen breakfast, also continue to grow on a 2-year CAGR basis, even despite capacity limitations and declines in away-from-home channels. We've already discussed both of our key brands in frozen, MorningStar Farms plant-based foods and Eggo from the griddle foods. Both continue to generate strong consumption growth on a 2-year CAGR basis, and both are poised to sustain growth. And before we move on from our discussion of North America, we should touch on our U.S. away-from-home business in Slide 28. The slide shows rolling 2-year average growth rates in our net sales over the past few quarters in these channels. As restrictions eased and consumer mobility increased, we saw a gradual recovery get underway in these channels. It remains to be seen whether this trajectory will continue given recent pandemic developments. So our North America region continues to perform well even as we work to catch up the demand and work our way through industry-wide shortages of freight, labor and materials. Now let's take a look at Europe, shown on Slide 29. Kellogg Europe posted its 15th consecutive quarter of organic growth, a remarkable track record of consistency in this market. Volume had to lap a year ago surge, but we sustained good price/mix growth driven by RGM actions. And on a 2-year CAGR basis, you can see that we remain in strong net sales growth with this growth being driven by both snacks and cereal. Importantly, we also continue to perform well in market. Retail scanner data indicate only modest sequential deceleration of category and Kellogg consumption growth on a 2-year CAGR basis. On that 2-year CAGR basis, we kept up with the salty snacks category with particular recent strength in France and Spain. Our consumer promotion around the Euro's soccer tournament was our biggest summer promo ever for Pringles. In cereal, our 2-year growth has outpaced the category in most markets, led by key brands like Crunchy Nut in the U.K. and Tresor and Extra in Continental Europe, and Coco Pops and Cocoa Krispies more broadly. Europe's operating profit lapped a year ago quarter in which operating profit grew more than 35% when it was elevated by at-home demand, outsized operating leverage and delayed brand investment during the height of the pandemic. Nevertheless, on a 2-year CAGR basis, we grew our profit at a double-digit rate in Q2. So clearly, Kellogg Europe continues to perform very well. Moving to Latin America in Slide 30. Latin America had a notably strong quarter. It grew organic net sales by 9% on top of last year's 14% gain, resulting in strong double-digit growth on a 2-year CAGR basis. Volume had to lap last year's 11% surge and this was felt primarily in cereal, but we sustained strong price/mix growth, driven by RGM actions across the portfolio and markets. The result was a year-on-year net sales growth in all subregions and as shown on the slide, sustained momentum on a 2-year CAGR basis. Scanner data do indicate a gradual slowing of at-home demand, which for us manifests itself in cereal. Nevertheless, our 2-year CAGRs for consumption remains strong in our key cereal markets, with Kellogg exceeding category growth rates, particularly for big brands like Corn Flakes and Froot Loops. Similarly, Pringles outpaced 2-year CAGRs for salty snacks categories in key markets and has gained share on a 1-year basis in our biggest markets, Mexico and Brazil. Meanwhile, our Parati business in Brazil continued to post strong consumption growth and increased share in biscuits. While operating profit had to lap a near doubling in the year earlier quarter, it was still up strongly on a 2-year CAGR basis. Despite high cost, they were heightened further by adverse transactional currency exchange. We clearly are performing well in this region. And while we are somewhat cautious about decelerating at-home demand and further regulatory pressure in the second half, this year is certainly shaping up to be a good one for Kellogg Latin America. And we'll conclude our regional discussion with AMEA in Slide 31. AMEA produced another quarter of exceptional organic net sales growth, both on a 1-year and 2-year CAGR basis. Both volume and price/mix contributed to the strong year-on-year growth. Geographically, the growth was broad-based and driven by emerging markets. It was led by double-digit gains in Africa. Within Africa, we experienced notably exceptional growth in Nigeria. Our business there has been dependently in growth for a long time, and its recent acceleration and momentum has been impressive. Meanwhile, we also generated good growth elsewhere in Africa and in the Middle East. We generated double-digit organic net sales growth in Asia as well, and the gains were broad-based across markets like India, Japan and Korea, and the growth came from both snacks and cereal. Even in developed market, Australia, our sales were roughly flat against last year's surge. AMEA's operating profit growth was also outstanding in Q2, growing 25% year-on-year. So AMEA continues to demonstrate strong momentum, and while we would not expect it to keep up this exceptional rate of growth, it is very clearly a dependable growth driver for us. Allow me to wrap up with a brief summary on Slide 33. We have completed another quarter of strong execution and performance, capping a first half that featured the following: Underlying business momentum, driven by our biggest brands; unlocking capacity so we can resume full commercial activity in certain products; sustained growth momentum in emerging markets; leveraging enhanced capabilities from data and analytics, to innovation, to ESG; strong cash flow and balance sheet, providing financial flexibility and increased cash to shareowners; a continuation of balanced financial delivery; and an affirmation of our full year guidance, as top line momentum helps offset the impact of higher cost pressures and global supply chain obstacles. As I mentioned earlier, the current business environment is anything but business as usual. In addition to the challenges of ensuring our employees' safety, we and the entire economy are wrestling with tight supply of materials, freight and labor as well as the related rise in their costs. We managed through this environment very effectively in the first half, and we affirm guidance today with confidence that we will continue to manage through it in the second half. We remain as convinced as ever that we are stronger today as a company. So before closing, I want to thank our Kellogg employees for their dedication and hard work in what have been incredibly challenging circumstances. And with that, we'd be happy to take any questions you might have.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: So I guess my question is around the commentary just around the rising costs and some of the supply chain issues, like sourcing materials in North America. And so my question is, in terms of mitigating that, you've taken some actions in the second half to begin to try to mitigate. But I guess, as we go forward, how should we think about how much of this maybe leaks into the first half of next year? And are there other incremental actions, whether it's pricing or productivity that you might have to take in order to sort of stay on top of this as we move beyond this current fiscal year?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Thanks for the question, Bryan. And you hit on some of the most important activities. And we always like to say that our first-line of defense against something like this is productivity, right? So we've been working hard at productivity and looking for every area where we can be more efficient. And then RGM. Obviously, everything about RGM and the capabilities we've been building is very important right now, because the surge in inflation that we're all seeing, which is clearly industry-wide, is -- I'm not telling anybody anything they don't know, is quite significant. And on balance, probably the most we've seen in nearly a decade. And so all these things are going to be very important, but we're going to continue to invest in our brands. Because as you've heard me say before, we can go to the trade and talk about rising commodity prices and all these things, which are very factual, but the more we spend against our brands in terms of innovation and making sure that they pull off the shelf, the more we earn the right to have those discussions with our retailers. As it moves into the future into 2022, it's hard to say how long this persists. It's very pervasive. There are certain things that are clearly going to unwind. Containers will eventually find their rightful places in the world, labor shortages should mitigate, but it's hard to predict. And we're planning for an ongoing challenging cost environment well into next year. Amit, I don't know if you have anything to add?\nAmit Banati: Yes. I think just to build on what Steve said. If you look at our inflation, it came in higher than what we had expected in the second quarter. I think we kind of closed the first half at around mid-single-digit rates of inflation. And I think as we look to the second half, we expect that to accelerate to high single digits. I think as you would have seen in our quarter two results, we're seeing strong price/mix come through globally. So across all our markets. And that will continue to be an emphasis in the second half as well. We are taking our revenue growth management actions, and you'll start -- and you will continue to see the impact of that in the second half as well. And then I think just from a margin standpoint, like I mentioned, our outlook now for the year is that our gross margin will be slightly below 2019 levels. But I think it's important to note that our gross profit dollars will be higher than in 2019.\nOperator: The next question is from Alexia Howard with Bernstein.\nAlexia Howard: So just a couple of questions. On the production and shipping issues, is that really just speaking to the fire and perhaps labor problems on the cereal side of the business in the U.S.? Or is it more broad-based? And would we expect more out of stocks to happen as a result of that? And then I have a follow-up.\nAmit Banati: I think -- Alexia, this is Amit here. It's broad-based. And I think everyone is seeing it. If you kind of look at labor shortages, there are widespread shortages of labor, particularly here in the U.S. and that's impacting the freight market. We've seen the spot market in the freight significantly up due to a shortage of drivers. It's impacting our operation in our factories in terms of just labor and it's impacting the entire supply chain. So we are seeing it in our suppliers as well. So it is broad-based. And then when you look internationally, COVID is raging in some emerging markets. And so we've seen COVID restrictions kick in, and a couple of our facilities have been impacted because of COVID restrictions. So broad-based.\nAlexia Howard: Great. I really appreciate it. And just a really minor follow-up. Are you able to quantify the currency impact on EBIT and on operating profit and earnings per share for the full year? Just so that we have an idea of what the guidance implies.\nAmit Banati: Yes. I think it's hard -- I mean, it's hard to kind of forecast exchange rates. I think if you look at where the rates are today, you'd say that it's about 2% on the EPS from a forex standpoint. It's about 1% to 2% on a net sales basis. So that's kind of the -- if you look at just where rates are today.\nOperator: The next question is from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies.\nRobert Dickerson: So just a question around emerging markets. I know, Steve, you've said it's about 20% of the business. Obviously, we've seen some nice pricing already come through there, even though it looks like currencies hasn't been a headwind. So I'm just curious, kind of net-net within kind of the broader emerging market platform you have, has the strategy just been -- you think that volumes essentially can remain somewhat steady as you get through that back half of the year, while pricing is still elevated, maybe there was just some pricing opportunity, I think, that you had spoken to kind of coming out of Q1? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Thanks for the question, Rob. Obviously, we're very pleased with the emerging market performance in the first half. It was surprisingly strong. And I say that because, as Amit already mentioned and as everybody knows, COVID really is raging in many of these parts of the world. But I think our strength there really comes down to the execution of our strategy, which starts with the affordability pyramid, which we've talked about in the past. Our portfolio is much more affordable today than it has been in years. It's much more locally relevant in terms of the foods that we bring to market. And so that's allowed us to weather what is a very uncertain environment in many of these markets. We also have a very advantaged position in some of these markets. If you think about our West African Nigerian business, our strength in route-to-market through our Multipro distributor allows us to mean to operate in this very challenging environment. The Parati acquisition in Brazil gave us strong route to market. So the focus on route to market and affordability has allowed us to weather this very challenging and, in fact, be very successful in the first half of the year. We're cautious going forward. We wouldn't expect this type of elevated performance to continue. And we say that just because of the level of uncertainty around COVID, around potential disruptions. We have had some factory disruptions in the emerging markets in the past quarter. We can't guarantee that, that won't happen again. And so it's with some degree of just caution that we look forward relative to the performance that we had in the first half of the year.\nRobert Dickerson: All right. Great. And then just to focus on North America for a minute. Obviously, the price/mix is already coming through nicely in Q2. I'm assuming some of that is more mix driven relative to pricing you've already taken. So as I think kind of on the go-forward in the back half, is kind of what you did in Q2 is that, let's say, one, a fair proxy for what you might be able to put up in price/mix? And then secondly is just on the tonnage side, obviously, came off a bit in Q2. I realize you're being a bit cautious on how that plays out given at-home deceleration potential. For the same time, it seems like maybe your portfolio should be a little bit better insulated, but relative to others in the volume side, in the back half, given you don't have extremely tough comparison and also because you test some of the on-the-go exposure. So kind of 2 parts, pricing and then tonnage expectations, and that's it.\nAmit Banati: Yes. So just starting with the pricing. We saw, like I said, around 4% price/mix in the first half, and it was across all our markets, both in the U.S. and in the international markets. And it was more price than mix in the first half, and we'd expect that to continue in the second half. And we'd expect to continue to execute our revenue growth management actions.\nRobert Dickerson: Right. Great. And then just on the volume side, just kind of thinking about portfolio construct and, I guess, elasticity, et cetera.\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. So we feel pretty good about the volume side of the equation. But we're also continuing to focus on the balance of price/mix. As you think about our various categories, obviously, the second quarter was the really big lap when it comes to tonnage. And then the back half of the year becomes less so.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler.\nMichael Lavery: You've passed your two toughest comps for organic growth and averaged around a 2% organic growth lift in the first half despite that. And I know you've raised the guidelines -- the guidance for top line expectations, but it certainly would point to a deceleration. You've called out some of the COVID uncertainty, especially in emerging markets. But what are the real key drivers there that make you think this will slow down so much in the second half?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes, Michael, thanks for the question. I think, obviously, if you just reflect back on the last 18 months, there was a time when many companies weren't giving guidance. And we've tried to be as transparent as we possibly can all throughout this. We're clearly pleased with the first half of the year. We're pleased with the top line performance. But as we look to the second half of the year, we did slightly raise the guidance that we have for the top line. But again, the types of performances we've had in emerging markets have been quite elevated. And we're trying to do a center cut down the middle of the fairway. Do we hope to do better? We certainly always hope to do better. But we're trying to give the best possible outlook that we can, given what is still an incredibly uncertain environment. I mean, just a few weeks ago, you wouldn't have forecast a type of Delta variant and pandemic disruptions that we're seeing again in North America.\nMichael Lavery: So apart from some of just uncertainty and -- especially COVID and/or emerging market-related, there's not a specific headwind to watch out for, it's just recognizing some of those moving parts?\nAmit Banati: Yes. The only other thing I'd say is that our at-home demand is decelerating, right? We saw that from quarter one into quarter two. So if you look at our 2-year CAGRs, right, it was 6% in quarter one, it's 4.5% in quarter two. So you are seeing the deceleration of demand at home. So that's built into our outlook as well that we'd continue to see that. Now I think to Steve's point, right, depending on how the pandemic plays out and the twists and turns, it's hard to forecast that.\nOperator: The next question is from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim.\nLaurent Grandet: Actually a question about your manufacturing facilities. I mean you mentioned on 2 things. First, in the U.S. Cereal, you had some issues there. So just wanted to understand what is the missed opportunity in terms of sales occurred in the second quarter? And how long do you think that will last? And then, I mean, you mentioned in your remarks as well, you had to shut down some facilities in emerging countries. So I'd like to understand where that is and what it is, and if there is additional risk coming into the third quarter?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes, Laurent, thanks for the question. I'd say the supply disruptions that we're seeing are the same things that many in the industry are seeing, everything from a shortage of labor, which is quite challenging. Shortage of even things like pallets. So the whole supply chain was disrupted. And much of that, you can point to China went into lockdown, obviously, very early in the pandemic and was the first out, recovered quite quickly and sucked up a lot of resource, and it's really created supply imbalances throughout the world that everybody has had to deal with, and we've had to deal with inside North America. During that time, we're also adding capacity. We've successfully added capacity throughout the world. We had what we call a vertical start-up of our Pringles line in Poland, which was done very successfully. So we have been able to add capacity. In some areas in North America, it's been a little bit slowed because of some of these supply disruptions. And so we haven't been able to get the level of capacity as quickly as we would want. But it's all in our outlook. So as we talk about the second half of the year and what we expect in the second half of the year, we're doing our best to forecast these types of disruptions and this type of slowed activity relative to a nonpandemic world.\nLaurent Grandet: Yes. Can you specify? I mean the manufacturing facility that you had to close, in which countries and what type of business you have to close out in emerging market?\nAmit Banati: Yes. I think, Malaysia has seen a spike in the Delta variant in the last few weeks. And we have a manufacturing facility there in Malaysia of Pringles. So that line of production there was impacted, but the teams have done a remarkable job to get us back up and running. But we did see some disruption in the quarter. And South Africa, again, we've got a manufacturing location there, and there was some civil strikes and so that impacted production. But I think it's just with the COVID restrictions and with COVID continuing to rage, right, in many of these markets, right, we see these supply restrictions and restrictions on movement coming through.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Growe with Stifel.\nChristopher Growe: I just had a question for you on North American cereal. Obviously, it sounds like capacity is still a bit of an issue there. So I'm just curious how your share performed ex Frosted Flakes? It sounds like that's the one that's really causing the issues. And then when do you think you can get that back to a more normal promotional environment, I guess, for that brand?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. Off the top of my head, Frosted Flakes did make up probably more than half of our share loss. And much of that was still not getting back to the levels of commercial activity that we would like. And so we've talked about it in the back half of the year, getting that going again. I did mention a fire in one of our facilities. That will affect Frosted Flakes as well as some of our other brands, but the team is working very, very swiftly and quickly to get that back up to speed. So we're not -- you've heard me say in the past, we're not happy about losing share in U.S. Cereal. We believe it's not going to be a long-term -- or a continuing trend, but we've got work to do to get there. The other thing I'd just remind everybody is, obviously, we've got a lot of other businesses besides U.S. Cereal. It's an important business for us, but it is less than 1/5 of our total global portfolio.\nChristopher Growe: That's a good point there. I had one quick follow-up for Amit, if I could, please, which is last quarter, I think you had indicated you were pretty well hedged on your input cost. Could you give us an update on that? And if I could just add a bit of follow-on. The inflation you're seeing right now, is this on -- primarily on inputs where you're not hedged? Is that where we're seeing some of the incremental inflation come through?\nAmit Banati: Yes. So I think, our hedging, we're almost now fully hedged for the year, as you'd expect at this time of the year. So I think from a hedging standpoint, for the year, for '21, we're almost fully hedged. I think in terms of inflation, we've seen a little bit of inflation on our commodities. But I think the area that's turned inflationary is packaging, on flexible scans. So that has turned inflationary since our last outlook. And then I think the comment I made earlier around freight, we're seeing freight rates continue to rise. And more importantly, there are widespread shortages. And so just securing the supply of freight, right, is coming at much higher rates than what we had expected. And so I think those are the areas that we're seeing higher costs come through. And then the other one, which is hard to forecast is just the labor shortages. And that's kind of through the supply chain. So those are the areas that we are seeing higher costs come through.\nOperator: The next question is from Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nRobert Moskow: I have a couple of questions. The first is, if your sales do over-deliver in the back half because COVID ends up maybe benefiting you more than you think, would those incremental sales still be profitable? Or are they much less profitable, because the cost to deliver is really high? So that's the first thing. And then the second question is, North America snacks decelerated to 2% on a 2-year CAGR in the quarter. I think your snack peers are growing at a stronger rate than that. Were you surprised by the amount of decel? Did something hold it back in the quarter?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. So Rob, I'll start, and Amit can add color. On the first question, I would say, if you look at our first half performance, obviously, a strong top line helped us mitigate a very inflationary environment. And I think that's illustrative of any over-delivery. We would -- it's always going to be profitable. But there's clearly a cost challenge. And I think Amit pointed out in his prepared remarks, when we look at margins, we're still looking at 2019 as a decent base year, and it's likely will come in slightly below that, but the gross profit dollars will be significantly greater. And so that's the way we're thinking. We're always looking for profitable sales. But clearly, there's a lot of cost challenges, we'll try and deliver the best possible P&L shape that we can. And obviously, profitable sales are -- clearly continue to be important.\nAmit Banati: And I think just on your U.S. Snacks question. If you look at our first half, right, the 2-year CAGRs are around 4%. I think between the quarters, between quarter one and quarter two, there was some shipment timing. And also these -- remember, these numbers include the away-from-home channel as well, which continues to be impacted. I mean, it's moderating, but it's still below 2019 levels. So I think from an overall consumption standpoint, we're pleased with the consumption that we're seeing and the momentum that we are seeing in our snacks brands in the U.S.\nOperator: The next question is from Eric Larson with Seaport Research Partners.\nEric Larson: I have two real quick questions. The first is thank you for framing all your big brands and the size of those brands and the household penetration. The question I have on that is, you showed the incremental household penetration since COVID, but you don't really give the overall ACV penetration. And some of these brands are international. So it's hard for us to measure some of that. But can you make a case here for continued distribution gains as part of your overall revenue growth thesis?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Eric, thanks for the question. I think, obviously, we all look at the syndicated data. And it is limited to mostly developed markets, less so in developing markets. And distribution opportunities remain important for us, obviously, very important, and are different based on the maturity of the brands. And so if you look at our ACV distribution for our snacks and cereal business in the U.S., obviously very high. And then we'll look to add weighted ACV distribution as we look to launch new innovations, and we track that very closely. And so it's a clear important metric for us. And then with respect to -- what was the second part of the question? The -- oh, penetration. Yes. So we're looking at categories for us that are already very highly penetrated. And so if you look at the penetration gains we've had, we did see penetration gains across our portfolio in our developed markets. And we saw even more of that COVID lift coming from buy rates, though. And so increased household penetration is important. But obviously, looking at buy rates is equally, if not more important, when you're talking about categories which are already quite highly penetrated like U.S. Cereal and U.S. Snacks.\nEric Larson: Okay. And then my second question is you showed a gradual improvement in your eating away-from-home sales and in the industries that you compete in. And I know you have large exposure to universities and hotels, et cetera. Can you give us -- can you frame us where you are over or under indexed in your eating away-from-home channel penetration, so that as the economy reopens, et cetera, we know where you have your best leverage in your food service sales?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. So Eric, I'd say we're seeing all of it come back, but at different rates. We're over-indexed really in travel and lodging, schools, convenience stores, and they're coming back at different rates. So C-stores are coming back faster. Schools, we'll see. We'll see -- right now schools are starting in many parts of the world. And what happens there remains to be seen, but it looks like it will be coming back. Travel and lodging coming back slower and particularly business travel. But then you obviously see leisure travel and the airline starting to fill up planes again. So that seems to be coming back as well. And so it's very uneven, but by and large, coming back, as we said. Now as I said earlier, there's still a degree of uncertainty based on what's happening with the pandemic right now, and it's still below 2019 levels. So not yet close to where we were prepandemic.\nOperator: The next question is from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nStephen Powers: I guess the question I have, and you've talked about it a bit, but I'm still trying to better understand how much of the implied second half deceleration is really just prudent on your part, because of the uncertainty you've talked about versus things you have firmer line of sight to. Because as you've talked about the first half versus '19 was about 5%, some deceleration 1Q to 2Q, but we also had some shipment timing in there. So maybe not as stark as it looks. But the back half has implied essentially at 1% 2-year CAGR versus '19. So it's a pretty stark deceleration. And again, I'm just trying to figure out how much of that you actually have some line of sight to versus things that you're just pumping the brakes on just from an expectation standpoint.\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Thanks, Steve. I'd say, again, very pleased with the first half performance. As we think about the second half performance, as Amit mentioned, we are seeing decelerating at-home demand. And so we've taken that into account. We've also taken into account the strong delivery in emerging markets and the likelihood that -- continuing that type of performance would be great. But obviously, we're trying to be prudent, and we're trying to be cautious based on supply disruptions that we have seen in the first half that could happen again in the second half. And as I said before, of course, we aim to over-deliver. We hope to over-deliver. But we're trying to take a prudent approach, given the degree of uncertainty that we still see and the trend in deceleration that is, in fact, real. And again, we hope to over-deliver, but this is what we felt was a pretty transparent and fair bit of guidance.\nJohn Renwick: Operator, I think we have time for one more.\nOperator: And that question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: I guess I too wanted to come at the implicit growth challenges in the back half, but I think we've beat that horse pretty aggressively. So let me zoom in a little bit into the U.S. Frozen business or North American frozen business. I guess I'm surprised, Steve, you showed in your prepared remarks the slides showing that 2-year stack growth on MorningStar Farms is slowing. And this quarter, you delivered shipments for frozen that are only marginally above where you were in 2019, based on the decline that you posted, the organic sales decline this quarter. So it begs the question of what's happening there? I would have thought that would be a growth engine with accelerating momentum, not deceleration. Is this a sign that maybe Incogmeato and your efforts in MorningStar Farms are beginning to fall flat?\nSteven Cahillane: No, Jason, far from it. MorningStar Farms continues to be a very exciting category for us, a very exciting brand for us. Underlying consumption is strong on a 1-year and 2-year basis. And Incogmeato -- to put it in perspective, Incogmeato entered a category -- the refrigerated category, which is very exciting, incredibly competitive with lots of entrants coming in, and it's growing share in distribution as we speak. If you look at the last year -- last 4 weeks, syndicated data, it's over a 2- share right now. And so would we like to be even higher than that? Of course, we would. But it's a very competitive category. MorningStar Farms is the leader in the category. And again, underlying 2-year stacked consumption is very good. So we stand by the performance of MorningStar Farms, what the team is doing. And far from falling flat, I think it's doing quite well. Strong growth beyond burgers as well in chicken and others.\nJason English: So is it shipment timing or something else that's driven such a weak sales quarter?\nAmit Banati: Yes. I think the shipment timing. I mean the overall consumption remains strong. And then I think within the shipment, you've got the away-from-home, as well, dynamic playing through. So -- but when you kind of look at retail consumption, it's strong.\nJason English: Congrats on a good quarter.\nSteven Cahillane: Thank you, Jason.\nAmit Banati: Thank you, Jason.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to John Renwick for any closing remarks.\nJohn Renwick: Thanks, everyone, for your interest. And if you do have follow-up questions, please do not hesitate to call us.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steven Cahillane",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are doing well. There is no question that we're still managing through a pandemic. In this environment, keeping employees safe remains job number one. And aiding our communities is more important than ever. We also continue to supply the world with food, though, this remains challenging as the pandemic persists. A reacceleration of COVID cases has brought on new restrictions, causing temporary shutdowns of production in some countries. Meantime, we and the vendors that supply us are having to manage through bottlenecks and shortages of materials, labor and freight, all created by demand-supply imbalances that are also pushing up costs. So 2021 is shaping up to be anything but business as usual, and I'm extremely proud of how our organization continues to persevere and succeed in such challenging conditions. I'm also pleased with how well we continue to execute against our strategy, deployed for balanced growth, which is depicted on Slide 6. From a business perspective, demand and eating occasions at home remained elevated in quarter two, but they are gradually shifting as consumer mobility returns. In the second quarter, this was reflected in an ads forecast continuation of decelerating at-home demand growth, as measured by 2-year compound annual growth rates in our cereal and frozen categories around the world. We also saw signs of gradual recovery in away-from-home channels in an on-the-go snacks and pack formats. These channels grew year-on-year and better than forecast, even if they remain below 2019 levels. Our Deploy for Growth boosters are working effectively from focusing on ever-evolving occasions, to leveraging our reshaped portfolio, to driving momentum in our world-class brands and to investing in our supply chain to better serve our customers. Our Better Days boosters, which further our ESG efforts continue to work effectively as well. A few Better Days highlights are shared on Slide 7. During the second quarter, we continued to progress toward our ongoing Better Days commitments. This slide calls out a few of our actions and achievements of the quarter. The key message is that this remains a critical element of our strategy, a clear focus of management and a part of the DNA of Kellogg Company.  And we turned in another quarter of strong business performance in the second quarter, as discussed on Slide 8. Overall, at-home demand remained elevated, and we saw continued recovery in our away-from-home channels. Most encouraging has been the momentum demonstrated by key long-term growth engines for us. Our world-class snacks brands sustained their momentum with many continuing to outpace their respective categories. Our plant-based protein business is continuing to show strong growth. Our emerging markets businesses sustained their rapid growth and continue to excel even amidst challenging business conditions. Meanwhile, we continue to manage through the global supply challenges, I referred to earlier even as we continue to bring on our planned capacity increases. From a financial standpoint, our second quarter continued the balanced delivery that we returned to in 2020. Specifically, comparing to pre-COVID 2019, we realized another quarter of strong organic top line growth and operating profit growth as well as improved cash flow generation. We are affirming our full year guidance today. Like so many others, we are currently facing increased cost inflation and supply hurdles, and that is factored into our second half assumptions. Nonetheless, the business is showing good momentum. And just as we work through these challenges in the second quarter, we're confident we can work through them in the second half as well. Let me now turn it over to Amit, so he can take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail. Thanks, Amit. Before we get into each of the 4 regions, let me start off by highlighting the strength of some of our most important growth drivers. The first is Pringles, shown on Slide 18. This $2 billion global retail sales brand continues to perform well around the world. Here in the United States, it continued to outpace the category on consumption growth using a 2-year CAGR to eliminate uneven comparisons. It's also outperforming the category on household penetration gains since the pandemic. And around the world, we are seeing similar momentum. We're seeing growth in original and core flavors. We're seeing incremental growth from innovations like Scorchin and Sizzl'n. Equally impressive has been Cheez-It, another world-class brand, shown on Slide 19. This $1 billion retail sales brand continues to perform well in the U.S. Its 2-year CAGRs remain well ahead of the category's growth and its household penetration has grown in contrast to the rest of the category. Meanwhile, our launches of this power brand into Canada and Brazil are off to strong starts. Let's not overlook 2 other world-class snack brands. On Slide 20, we can see the continued strength of Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Treats. Together, these 2 power brands represent $1 billion in measured channel retail sales in the U.S. alone. You can see from the slide that they are in terrific shape as well. Their consumption has continued to outpace the portable wholesome snacks category on a 2-year CAGR basis, and these brands have added households since the pandemic, whereas the overall category has not. Plant-based protein and our leading MorningStar Farms brand is another growth driver that is performing very well. As shown on Slide 21, this $400 million retail sales brand continues to show strong consumption growth on a 2-year CAGR basis and has continued to add to its household penetration. A key advantage of MorningStar Farms is the breadth of its offerings across product types. And in Q2, we continued to see double-digit 2-year CAGRs across segments like chicken, appetizers, breakfast meat and sausages. We continue to innovate against this brand, including its sub-brand Incogmeato, which continues to add distribution and share and is proving to be incremental to the MorningStar Farms franchise. MorningStar Farms growth has bumped up against our capacity at various times in the past year, even as it has faced numerous new entrants into the category. This is creating a lot of excitement in the category, and we are pleased with our momentum and prospects. And of course, there's Eggo, shown on Slide 22. This $900 million retail sales brand continues to perform well in the U.S. as indicated by its strong 2-year compound annual growth in consumption and by its better-than-category performance on household penetration. Meantime, the brand continues to grow on a 2-year basis in Canada and Mexico as well. Our emerging markets are another key growth driver for us. And as you can see on Slide 23, they have actually accelerated their growth over the past couple of years. As we've discussed many times, this is a testament to our geographic footprint, our portfolio of foods and brands, our local supply chains, our go-to-market and our experienced management teams. As you can see from the chart, we continued to record impressive growth in these markets in Q2, even in spite of challenges related to COVID. We grew strongly in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Russia, and we continue to grow in cereal, snacks and noodles. Emerging markets represent more than 20% of our net sales and are expected to remain an important growth driver for a long time to come. So some of our portfolio's most important growth drivers are very clearly showing good momentum and have only strengthened over the past year. And these aren't small businesses. Even just the ones I discussed here, collectively represent more than half of our company's net sales. Let's now discuss each of our regions. We'll start with North America in Slide 24. We sustained net sales growth on a 2-year basis in North America, even if that growth rate was held back by the pandemic's negative impact on away-from-home channels and on-the-go pack formats. Moreover, versus last year, our volume in Q2 was not only lapping last year's double-digit surge, but also felt the impact of our previously discussed shift of shipments into Q1 and resultant trade inventory coming out as expected during Q2. Importantly though, we realized good price mix growth driven by revenue growth management actions. And our overall sales growth was supported by good underlying consumption trends. We outpaced 4 of our 6 primary categories on a 2-year compound annual growth basis with our 2-year consumption growth accelerating sequentially from Q1 in 5 of our 6 categories. And as we discussed on the past few slides, this strong performance is being driven by many of our biggest brands. So the underlying fundamentals look good. On operating profit, remember that we were lapping a year ago quarter in which operating profit grew 36%, excluding divestiture impact, an unusually strong quarter elevated by at-home demand, outsized operating leverage and delayed brand investment during the height of the pandemic. On a 2-year CAGR basis though, you can see we continued to generate good operating profit growth driven by top line growth, productivity and price/mix. These have been able to offset the impacts of extremely high cost inflation this year as well as the frequent shortages of materials, freight and labor, which are most pronounced in North America. Let's take a closer look at our category groups in North America. Slide 25 shows that our net sales for snacks in North America continued to grow both on a 1-year and a 2-year CAGR basis, despite declines in away-from-home channels and many on-the-go foods and pack formats. U.S. consumption remains solid on a 2-year CAGR basis, outpacing all 3 of our snacks categories and led by power brands. In crackers, we outpaced the category on a 1-year and 2-year CAGR basis, led by continued strength in Cheez-IT and Club. In salty snacks, we outpaced the category on a 1-year and 2-year CAGR basis as well due to continued strength in Pringles, particularly its core 4 flavors, its new Scorchin innovation and multi-packs. And in portable wholesome snacks, we are seeing brands like Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Treats hold up very well on a 2-year CAGR basis, while also starting to see signs of recovery in our more on-the-go oriented brands, like Special K, Nutri-Grain and RXBARs.  In North America cereal, shown on Slide 26, organic net sales were off slightly on a 2-year CAGR basis due to declines in away-from-home channels. We also saw the impact of being capacity constrained on certain brands. In the U.S., the category's consumption was flat on a 2-year CAGR basis in Q2. And after being down about 1% in Q1, we improved to flat in Q2, keeping up with the category on that basis. Frosted Flakes accounted for most of the share decline related to pulling back on brand building and merchandising since Q4 last year, as we worked to maintain service levels and add capacity planned prior to the pandemic. Unfortunately, our capacity expansion has been slowed by current supply shortages and by our recent fire in one of our facilities. This will delay our return to normal commercial activity on affected brands. In the meantime, our business continues to progress well. We continue to lead the category and share of innovation, and we are seeing better performance in wellness-oriented brands, like Raisin Bran, Special K, Kashi and Bear Naked. And on Slide 27, we can see that our 2 frozen businesses, plant-based foods and frozen breakfast, also continue to grow on a 2-year CAGR basis, even despite capacity limitations and declines in away-from-home channels. We've already discussed both of our key brands in frozen, MorningStar Farms plant-based foods and Eggo from the griddle foods. Both continue to generate strong consumption growth on a 2-year CAGR basis, and both are poised to sustain growth. And before we move on from our discussion of North America, we should touch on our U.S. away-from-home business in Slide 28. The slide shows rolling 2-year average growth rates in our net sales over the past few quarters in these channels. As restrictions eased and consumer mobility increased, we saw a gradual recovery get underway in these channels. It remains to be seen whether this trajectory will continue given recent pandemic developments. So our North America region continues to perform well even as we work to catch up the demand and work our way through industry-wide shortages of freight, labor and materials. Now let's take a look at Europe, shown on Slide 29. Kellogg Europe posted its 15th consecutive quarter of organic growth, a remarkable track record of consistency in this market. Volume had to lap a year ago surge, but we sustained good price/mix growth driven by RGM actions. And on a 2-year CAGR basis, you can see that we remain in strong net sales growth with this growth being driven by both snacks and cereal. Importantly, we also continue to perform well in market. Retail scanner data indicate only modest sequential deceleration of category and Kellogg consumption growth on a 2-year CAGR basis. On that 2-year CAGR basis, we kept up with the salty snacks category with particular recent strength in France and Spain. Our consumer promotion around the Euro's soccer tournament was our biggest summer promo ever for Pringles. In cereal, our 2-year growth has outpaced the category in most markets, led by key brands like Crunchy Nut in the U.K. and Tresor and Extra in Continental Europe, and Coco Pops and Cocoa Krispies more broadly. Europe's operating profit lapped a year ago quarter in which operating profit grew more than 35% when it was elevated by at-home demand, outsized operating leverage and delayed brand investment during the height of the pandemic. Nevertheless, on a 2-year CAGR basis, we grew our profit at a double-digit rate in Q2. So clearly, Kellogg Europe continues to perform very well. Moving to Latin America in Slide 30. Latin America had a notably strong quarter. It grew organic net sales by 9% on top of last year's 14% gain, resulting in strong double-digit growth on a 2-year CAGR basis. Volume had to lap last year's 11% surge and this was felt primarily in cereal, but we sustained strong price/mix growth, driven by RGM actions across the portfolio and markets. The result was a year-on-year net sales growth in all subregions and as shown on the slide, sustained momentum on a 2-year CAGR basis. Scanner data do indicate a gradual slowing of at-home demand, which for us manifests itself in cereal. Nevertheless, our 2-year CAGRs for consumption remains strong in our key cereal markets, with Kellogg exceeding category growth rates, particularly for big brands like Corn Flakes and Froot Loops. Similarly, Pringles outpaced 2-year CAGRs for salty snacks categories in key markets and has gained share on a 1-year basis in our biggest markets, Mexico and Brazil. Meanwhile, our Parati business in Brazil continued to post strong consumption growth and increased share in biscuits. While operating profit had to lap a near doubling in the year earlier quarter, it was still up strongly on a 2-year CAGR basis. Despite high cost, they were heightened further by adverse transactional currency exchange. We clearly are performing well in this region. And while we are somewhat cautious about decelerating at-home demand and further regulatory pressure in the second half, this year is certainly shaping up to be a good one for Kellogg Latin America. And we'll conclude our regional discussion with AMEA in Slide 31. AMEA produced another quarter of exceptional organic net sales growth, both on a 1-year and 2-year CAGR basis. Both volume and price/mix contributed to the strong year-on-year growth. Geographically, the growth was broad-based and driven by emerging markets. It was led by double-digit gains in Africa. Within Africa, we experienced notably exceptional growth in Nigeria. Our business there has been dependently in growth for a long time, and its recent acceleration and momentum has been impressive. Meanwhile, we also generated good growth elsewhere in Africa and in the Middle East. We generated double-digit organic net sales growth in Asia as well, and the gains were broad-based across markets like India, Japan and Korea, and the growth came from both snacks and cereal. Even in developed market, Australia, our sales were roughly flat against last year's surge. AMEA's operating profit growth was also outstanding in Q2, growing 25% year-on-year. So AMEA continues to demonstrate strong momentum, and while we would not expect it to keep up this exceptional rate of growth, it is very clearly a dependable growth driver for us. Allow me to wrap up with a brief summary on Slide 33. We have completed another quarter of strong execution and performance, capping a first half that featured the following: Underlying business momentum, driven by our biggest brands; unlocking capacity so we can resume full commercial activity in certain products; sustained growth momentum in emerging markets; leveraging enhanced capabilities from data and analytics, to innovation, to ESG; strong cash flow and balance sheet, providing financial flexibility and increased cash to shareowners; a continuation of balanced financial delivery; and an affirmation of our full year guidance, as top line momentum helps offset the impact of higher cost pressures and global supply chain obstacles. As I mentioned earlier, the current business environment is anything but business as usual. In addition to the challenges of ensuring our employees' safety, we and the entire economy are wrestling with tight supply of materials, freight and labor as well as the related rise in their costs. We managed through this environment very effectively in the first half, and we affirm guidance today with confidence that we will continue to manage through it in the second half. We remain as convinced as ever that we are stronger today as a company. So before closing, I want to thank our Kellogg employees for their dedication and hard work in what have been incredibly challenging circumstances. And with that, we'd be happy to take any questions you might have. Yes. Thanks for the question, Bryan. And you hit on some of the most important activities. And we always like to say that our first-line of defense against something like this is productivity, right? So we've been working hard at productivity and looking for every area where we can be more efficient. And then RGM. Obviously, everything about RGM and the capabilities we've been building is very important right now, because the surge in inflation that we're all seeing, which is clearly industry-wide, is -- I'm not telling anybody anything they don't know, is quite significant. And on balance, probably the most we've seen in nearly a decade. And so all these things are going to be very important, but we're going to continue to invest in our brands. Because as you've heard me say before, we can go to the trade and talk about rising commodity prices and all these things, which are very factual, but the more we spend against our brands in terms of innovation and making sure that they pull off the shelf, the more we earn the right to have those discussions with our retailers. As it moves into the future into 2022, it's hard to say how long this persists. It's very pervasive. There are certain things that are clearly going to unwind. Containers will eventually find their rightful places in the world, labor shortages should mitigate, but it's hard to predict. And we're planning for an ongoing challenging cost environment well into next year. Amit, I don't know if you have anything to add? Yes. Thanks for the question, Rob. Obviously, we're very pleased with the emerging market performance in the first half. It was surprisingly strong. And I say that because, as Amit already mentioned and as everybody knows, COVID really is raging in many of these parts of the world. But I think our strength there really comes down to the execution of our strategy, which starts with the affordability pyramid, which we've talked about in the past. Our portfolio is much more affordable today than it has been in years. It's much more locally relevant in terms of the foods that we bring to market. And so that's allowed us to weather what is a very uncertain environment in many of these markets. We also have a very advantaged position in some of these markets. If you think about our West African Nigerian business, our strength in route-to-market through our Multipro distributor allows us to mean to operate in this very challenging environment. The Parati acquisition in Brazil gave us strong route to market. So the focus on route to market and affordability has allowed us to weather this very challenging and, in fact, be very successful in the first half of the year. We're cautious going forward. We wouldn't expect this type of elevated performance to continue. And we say that just because of the level of uncertainty around COVID, around potential disruptions. We have had some factory disruptions in the emerging markets in the past quarter. We can't guarantee that, that won't happen again. And so it's with some degree of just caution that we look forward relative to the performance that we had in the first half of the year. Yes. So we feel pretty good about the volume side of the equation. But we're also continuing to focus on the balance of price/mix. As you think about our various categories, obviously, the second quarter was the really big lap when it comes to tonnage. And then the back half of the year becomes less so. Yes, Michael, thanks for the question. I think, obviously, if you just reflect back on the last 18 months, there was a time when many companies weren't giving guidance. And we've tried to be as transparent as we possibly can all throughout this. We're clearly pleased with the first half of the year. We're pleased with the top line performance. But as we look to the second half of the year, we did slightly raise the guidance that we have for the top line. But again, the types of performances we've had in emerging markets have been quite elevated. And we're trying to do a center cut down the middle of the fairway. Do we hope to do better? We certainly always hope to do better. But we're trying to give the best possible outlook that we can, given what is still an incredibly uncertain environment. I mean, just a few weeks ago, you wouldn't have forecast a type of Delta variant and pandemic disruptions that we're seeing again in North America. Yes, Laurent, thanks for the question. I'd say the supply disruptions that we're seeing are the same things that many in the industry are seeing, everything from a shortage of labor, which is quite challenging. Shortage of even things like pallets. So the whole supply chain was disrupted. And much of that, you can point to China went into lockdown, obviously, very early in the pandemic and was the first out, recovered quite quickly and sucked up a lot of resource, and it's really created supply imbalances throughout the world that everybody has had to deal with, and we've had to deal with inside North America. During that time, we're also adding capacity. We've successfully added capacity throughout the world. We had what we call a vertical start-up of our Pringles line in Poland, which was done very successfully. So we have been able to add capacity. In some areas in North America, it's been a little bit slowed because of some of these supply disruptions. And so we haven't been able to get the level of capacity as quickly as we would want. But it's all in our outlook. So as we talk about the second half of the year and what we expect in the second half of the year, we're doing our best to forecast these types of disruptions and this type of slowed activity relative to a nonpandemic world. Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. Off the top of my head, Frosted Flakes did make up probably more than half of our share loss. And much of that was still not getting back to the levels of commercial activity that we would like. And so we've talked about it in the back half of the year, getting that going again. I did mention a fire in one of our facilities. That will affect Frosted Flakes as well as some of our other brands, but the team is working very, very swiftly and quickly to get that back up to speed. So we're not -- you've heard me say in the past, we're not happy about losing share in U.S. Cereal. We believe it's not going to be a long-term -- or a continuing trend, but we've got work to do to get there. The other thing I'd just remind everybody is, obviously, we've got a lot of other businesses besides U.S. Cereal. It's an important business for us, but it is less than 1/5 of our total global portfolio. Yes. So Rob, I'll start, and Amit can add color. On the first question, I would say, if you look at our first half performance, obviously, a strong top line helped us mitigate a very inflationary environment. And I think that's illustrative of any over-delivery. We would -- it's always going to be profitable. But there's clearly a cost challenge. And I think Amit pointed out in his prepared remarks, when we look at margins, we're still looking at 2019 as a decent base year, and it's likely will come in slightly below that, but the gross profit dollars will be significantly greater. And so that's the way we're thinking. We're always looking for profitable sales. But clearly, there's a lot of cost challenges, we'll try and deliver the best possible P&L shape that we can. And obviously, profitable sales are -- clearly continue to be important. Yes. Eric, thanks for the question. I think, obviously, we all look at the syndicated data. And it is limited to mostly developed markets, less so in developing markets. And distribution opportunities remain important for us, obviously, very important, and are different based on the maturity of the brands. And so if you look at our ACV distribution for our snacks and cereal business in the U.S., obviously very high. And then we'll look to add weighted ACV distribution as we look to launch new innovations, and we track that very closely. And so it's a clear important metric for us. And then with respect to -- what was the second part of the question? The -- oh, penetration. Yes. So we're looking at categories for us that are already very highly penetrated. And so if you look at the penetration gains we've had, we did see penetration gains across our portfolio in our developed markets. And we saw even more of that COVID lift coming from buy rates, though. And so increased household penetration is important. But obviously, looking at buy rates is equally, if not more important, when you're talking about categories which are already quite highly penetrated like U.S. Cereal and U.S. Snacks. Yes. So Eric, I'd say we're seeing all of it come back, but at different rates. We're over-indexed really in travel and lodging, schools, convenience stores, and they're coming back at different rates. So C-stores are coming back faster. Schools, we'll see. We'll see -- right now schools are starting in many parts of the world. And what happens there remains to be seen, but it looks like it will be coming back. Travel and lodging coming back slower and particularly business travel. But then you obviously see leisure travel and the airline starting to fill up planes again. So that seems to be coming back as well. And so it's very uneven, but by and large, coming back, as we said. Now as I said earlier, there's still a degree of uncertainty based on what's happening with the pandemic right now, and it's still below 2019 levels. So not yet close to where we were prepandemic. Yes. Thanks, Steve. I'd say, again, very pleased with the first half performance. As we think about the second half performance, as Amit mentioned, we are seeing decelerating at-home demand. And so we've taken that into account. We've also taken into account the strong delivery in emerging markets and the likelihood that -- continuing that type of performance would be great. But obviously, we're trying to be prudent, and we're trying to be cautious based on supply disruptions that we have seen in the first half that could happen again in the second half. And as I said before, of course, we aim to over-deliver. We hope to over-deliver. But we're trying to take a prudent approach, given the degree of uncertainty that we still see and the trend in deceleration that is, in fact, real. And again, we hope to over-deliver, but this is what we felt was a pretty transparent and fair bit of guidance. No, Jason, far from it. MorningStar Farms continues to be a very exciting category for us, a very exciting brand for us. Underlying consumption is strong on a 1-year and 2-year basis. And Incogmeato -- to put it in perspective, Incogmeato entered a category -- the refrigerated category, which is very exciting, incredibly competitive with lots of entrants coming in, and it's growing share in distribution as we speak. If you look at the last year -- last 4 weeks, syndicated data, it's over a 2- share right now. And so would we like to be even higher than that? Of course, we would. But it's a very competitive category. MorningStar Farms is the leader in the category. And again, underlying 2-year stacked consumption is very good. So we stand by the performance of MorningStar Farms, what the team is doing. And far from falling flat, I think it's doing quite well. Strong growth beyond burgers as well in chicken and others. Thank you, Jason."

            "name": "Amit Banati",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Our financial results for the second quarter are summarized on Slide 10. It was another strong quarter that's viewed on a 2-year basis, because of the unusual period we were lapping from last year. On an organic basis, we nearly matched last year's unusually high net sales, generating 4.5% growth on a 2-year compound annual growth rate or CAGR basis. This came in better than expected, thanks to an impressive momentum in emerging markets and faster improvement than expected in our away-from-home channels. Currency-neutral adjusted-basis operating profit declined against last year's exceptional quarter when it grew 27% despite losing about 8 points to divestiture impact. Excluding those divested businesses from the 2019 base, our operating profit in quarter two this year grew at a 2-year CAGR of about 8%. This is strong growth that indicates underlying margin expansion. Currency-neutral adjusted-basis earnings per share declined as it lapped last year's outsized growth, but it grew about 9% on a 2-year CAGR basis, excluding the divestiture impact on operating profit. And cash flow was again stronger than anticipated for the quarter. And while it lapped last year's unusually high level, this cash flow was again higher than that of quarter two of 2019. So on a 2-year basis, we saw another quarter of good top line growth, margin expansion and conversion of profit into cash flow. That's the kind of balance we strive for. Let's examine these results in a little more detail. We'll start with net sales on Slide 11. Net sales remained strong despite tough comparisons. Volume declined against last year's double-digit surge, but remained up on a 2-year basis, even despite an as-expected reversal of shipment timing from quarter one in North America. Price/mix was again an important driver. Once again, most of this price/mix growth came from revenue growth management initiatives implemented in all 4 regions. Mix was only slightly positive as a mix shift towards Snacks was partially offset by resumed mix shift towards Multipro, our West African distributor business. Our 2-year organic net sales CAGR was 4.5% in quarter two, a very strong performance. Rounding out net sales, foreign currency translation was again positive in quarter two. As we look to the rest of the year, we assume continued deceleration in at-home demand with moderation in away-from-home declines being more modest due to the mix of our channels. We've seen this reflected in our 2-year CAGRs from quarter one to quarter two, and we expect this deceleration to continue into quarter three and quarter four. And based on where forex rates are right now, we would expect to see a less positive impact on net sales in the second half. Moving down the income statement. Slide 12 shows two important drivers of our profit margin performance. As you know, our gross profit margin in quarter two was lapping outsized operating leverage in quarter two, 2020, when our plants ran flat out, producing only a limited lineup of SKUs. But importantly, our gross margin in quarter two, as in quarter one, increased from 2019 levels. Productivity and price realization drove this 2-year improvement, more than overcoming high cost inflation, labor and freight disruptions, COVID-related costs and a mix shift towards emerging markets. So this 2-year improvement is very encouraging. As we'll talk about in a moment, we expect to see more pressure on gross margin in the second half than we did in the first half, reflecting the current operating and cost environment. Operating profit margin remained higher than quarter two, 2019 as well. This reflects the gross margin performance and good discipline on overhead. Brand building investment, while up double digits against last year's delays, was up more modestly versus 2 years ago. As we look to the second half, our SG&A expense may provide some offset to the gross margin pressure. SG&A expense in the second half should moderate year-on-year. Not only because of last year's back-weighted brand building, particularly in quarter four, but also because of lapping last year's incentive compensation. This could be partially offset by a gradual resumption of travel and related activities as economies reopen. Moving down the P&L. Let's turn to Slide 13. During quarter two, interest expense decreased year-on-year on lower debt, and this decrease will continue for the remainder of the year, with quarter four additionally lapping the $20 million debt redemption cost we recorded last year. Of note, during the quarter, we issued our first ever sustainability bond, which was very well received. Other income increased modestly year-on-year to a level that is a little higher than we would expect for the remaining quarters, owing to favorability in various nonpension items. Our effective tax rate of 22.6% was essentially in line with our full year forecast rate. JV earnings and minority interest together were roughly in line with last year. And average shares outstanding decreased year-on-year, reflecting the impact of quarter one's buybacks. We still expect full year average shares outstanding to be around 0.5% lower than 2020. Let's now discuss our cash flow and balance sheet shown on Slide 14. Year-to-date, our cash flow remains below last year's unusually high level as expected, but well above that of the first half of 2019. This 2-year increase is driven by our improved operating profit and improved cash flow conversion. We finished the first half ahead of our expectations for cash flow. And as we look to the rest of the year, cash flow should remain below last year's COVID-aided levels, but still well above 2019. Meanwhile, our balance sheet remains solid. Net debt remains roughly even with last year and lower than each of the prior 2 years, even despite our increase in cash return to shareowners in form of resumed share buybacks and increased dividend. So our financial condition is quite strong. Slide 15 shows where our results stand after the first 6 months of 2021. Obviously, we've had a good year so far, producing strong and balanced financial results on a 2-year basis and staying modestly ahead of our own internal forecast. This strong start is all the more important when you consider just how much more challenging the business environment has gotten lately. Now let's discuss our full year guidance shown on Slide 16. As Steve mentioned, we are affirming our overall guidance. Within that guidance, we are raising our net sales guidance. We are now calling for organic growth of flat to up to 1%, which is a bit higher than our previous guidance for flat, reflecting our business momentum, particularly in emerging markets. This equates to almost 3% growth on a 2-year CAGR basis. Volume will continue to lap last year's large gains but price/mix will remain positive as we execute revenue growth management actions to cover higher input costs. Our guidance for currency-neutral adjusted operating profit is unchanged, still calling for a year-on-year decrease of about 1% to 2%, equating to almost 4% growth on a 2-year CAGR basis, excluding the divestiture impact. This reflects our stronger-than-expected quarter two profit and raised full year net sales outlook, balanced by increased cost pressures and operating challenges that make us a bit more cautious about the second half. Specifically, we have the productivity and revenue growth management actions in place to continue to cover high market-driven cost for commodities and freight. However, the economy-wide supply chain challenges, that Steve mentioned, are impeding production and shipping and creating incremental operating costs as well, particularly in quarter three. Because of this, we now expect gross profit margin to finish 2021 slightly below 2019 levels, but well above 2019 in gross profit dollars. We are also affirming our guidance for 1% to 2% growth in currency-neutral adjusted earnings per share, which equates to almost 5% growth on a 2-year CAGR basis. And we continue to look for cash flow to finish the year in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. This outlook balances the momentum in our business with the challenging operating environment and balances our margin protection actions against heightened cost pressures. To summarize, we remain in strong financial condition, and we remain solidly on track for continued balanced financial delivery on a 2-year basis. And with that, let me turn it back to Steve for a review of our major businesses. Yes. I think just to build on what Steve said. If you look at our inflation, it came in higher than what we had expected in the second quarter. I think we kind of closed the first half at around mid-single-digit rates of inflation. And I think as we look to the second half, we expect that to accelerate to high single digits. I think as you would have seen in our quarter two results, we're seeing strong price/mix come through globally. So across all our markets. And that will continue to be an emphasis in the second half as well. We are taking our revenue growth management actions, and you'll start -- and you will continue to see the impact of that in the second half as well. And then I think just from a margin standpoint, like I mentioned, our outlook now for the year is that our gross margin will be slightly below 2019 levels. But I think it's important to note that our gross profit dollars will be higher than in 2019. I think -- Alexia, this is Amit here. It's broad-based. And I think everyone is seeing it. If you kind of look at labor shortages, there are widespread shortages of labor, particularly here in the U.S. and that's impacting the freight market. We've seen the spot market in the freight significantly up due to a shortage of drivers. It's impacting our operation in our factories in terms of just labor and it's impacting the entire supply chain. So we are seeing it in our suppliers as well. So it is broad-based. And then when you look internationally, COVID is raging in some emerging markets. And so we've seen COVID restrictions kick in, and a couple of our facilities have been impacted because of COVID restrictions. So broad-based. Yes. I think it's hard -- I mean, it's hard to kind of forecast exchange rates. I think if you look at where the rates are today, you'd say that it's about 2% on the EPS from a forex standpoint. It's about 1% to 2% on a net sales basis. So that's kind of the -- if you look at just where rates are today. Yes. So just starting with the pricing. We saw, like I said, around 4% price/mix in the first half, and it was across all our markets, both in the U.S. and in the international markets. And it was more price than mix in the first half, and we'd expect that to continue in the second half. And we'd expect to continue to execute our revenue growth management actions. Yes. The only other thing I'd say is that our at-home demand is decelerating, right? We saw that from quarter one into quarter two. So if you look at our 2-year CAGRs, right, it was 6% in quarter one, it's 4.5% in quarter two. So you are seeing the deceleration of demand at home. So that's built into our outlook as well that we'd continue to see that. Now I think to Steve's point, right, depending on how the pandemic plays out and the twists and turns, it's hard to forecast that. Yes. I think, Malaysia has seen a spike in the Delta variant in the last few weeks. And we have a manufacturing facility there in Malaysia of Pringles. So that line of production there was impacted, but the teams have done a remarkable job to get us back up and running. But we did see some disruption in the quarter. And South Africa, again, we've got a manufacturing location there, and there was some civil strikes and so that impacted production. But I think it's just with the COVID restrictions and with COVID continuing to rage, right, in many of these markets, right, we see these supply restrictions and restrictions on movement coming through. Yes. So I think, our hedging, we're almost now fully hedged for the year, as you'd expect at this time of the year. So I think from a hedging standpoint, for the year, for '21, we're almost fully hedged. I think in terms of inflation, we've seen a little bit of inflation on our commodities. But I think the area that's turned inflationary is packaging, on flexible scans. So that has turned inflationary since our last outlook. And then I think the comment I made earlier around freight, we're seeing freight rates continue to rise. And more importantly, there are widespread shortages. And so just securing the supply of freight, right, is coming at much higher rates than what we had expected. And so I think those are the areas that we're seeing higher costs come through. And then the other one, which is hard to forecast is just the labor shortages. And that's kind of through the supply chain. So those are the areas that we are seeing higher costs come through. And I think just on your U.S. Snacks question. If you look at our first half, right, the 2-year CAGRs are around 4%. I think between the quarters, between quarter one and quarter two, there was some shipment timing. And also these -- remember, these numbers include the away-from-home channel as well, which continues to be impacted. I mean, it's moderating, but it's still below 2019 levels. So I think from an overall consumption standpoint, we're pleased with the consumption that we're seeing and the momentum that we are seeing in our snacks brands in the U.S. Yes. I think the shipment timing. I mean the overall consumption remains strong. And then I think within the shipment, you've got the away-from-home, as well, dynamic playing through. So -- but when you kind of look at retail consumption, it's strong. Thank you, Jason."

After the speaker\u2019s remarks there will be a question-and-answer session with the publishing analysts. Please note, this event is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for Kellogg Company.\nJohn Renwick: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for a review of our first quarter 2021 results as well as an update regarding our outlook for the full-year 2021. I\u2019m joined this morning by Steve Cahillane, our Chairman and CEO; and Amit Banati, our Chief Financial Officer. Slide number 3 shows our forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware, certain statements made today such as projections for Kellogg Company\u2019s future performance, are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the third slide of this presentation as well as to our public SEC filings. This is a particular note during the current COVID-19 pandemic when the length and severity of the crisis and resultant economic and business impacts are so difficult to predict. A recording of today\u2019s webcast and supporting documents will be archived for at least 90 days on the Investor page of kelloggcompany.com. As always, when referring to our results and outlook, unless otherwise noted, we will be referring to them on an organic basis for net sales and on a currency-neutral adjusted basis for operating profit and earnings per share. And now I will turn it over to Steve.\nSteven Cahillane: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are doing well and staying healthy. Here at Kellogg, I\u2019m continuously impressed by the way our organization has remained focused and engaged in executing through what are undeniably challenging circumstances, both at work and at home. Keeping employees safe remains job number one. And in quarter one; we continued to execute safety protocols while following the guidance of local health authorities. Supplying the world with food continued to require agility, including temporary labor and incremental capacity. And of course, we continue to actively support our communities. After all, the pandemic is not behind us. In fact, in some parts of the world, we are seeing it accelerate, and our thoughts and prayers go out to all those affected. Turning to Slide 6. Our deploy for balanced growth strategy remains as relevant and effective as ever during this pandemic. Its growth boosters continue to do their job. As much as anything else, this pandemic has prompted a shift in eating occasions. Our focus on occasions continue to be evident in the first quarter in our tailored consumer messaging and an innovation geared towards specific occasions. The portfolio that we have shaped toward growth has benefited from balance of convenient meals, snacking that can be done at home, plant-based foods and sustained growth in emerging markets. Our building of world-class brands has been evident in our commitment to continued equity building communication as well as leveraging our data and analytics to devise creative ways to reach new consumers and sustain momentum in the marketplace. And our commitment to perfect service, perfect store, tested by the sudden and sharp rise in demand has forced us to get creative around ways to increase throughput, even if it meant temporarily holding back and merchandising activity to ensure inventory and incurring incremental logistics cost to get food to our customers. And we continue to grow rapidly in e-commerce, leveraging our enhanced capabilities there. Environmental, social and governance is not a new area of focus for Kellogg. It has been embedded in our history and strategy for a long, long time. Our ESG oriented better days boosters always a key element of our strategy, have become more important to our communities, employees, customers and consumers. At CAGNY, a few months ago, we discussed our global better days purpose and strategy and on Slide #7, you can see that we continue to progress in this area, addressing the interconnected issues of health, hunger relief and climate. On nourishing with our foods, we have continued to innovate and renovate our foods, providing choices across wellness and indulgence and during the quarter, our Kashi became the first organic cereal to be authorized for the women, infants and children program in the United States. On feeding people in need, we have remained in an elevated level of donations making accelerated progress toward our goal of feeding 375 million families. During the first quarter, Pop-Tarts joined with the United Way to raise money for school vegetable gardens. On nurturing our planet, we announced during the first quarter, our commitment to achieve over 50% renewable electricity to address Kellogg manufacturing globally by the end of 2022, and we celebrated women farmers as part of International Women\u2019s Day. And under living our founders\u2019 values, we launched in the first quarter our new equity, diversity and inclusion vision and strategy to all employees in all four regions. Aligned with those values, we launched a campaign called a Call for Food Justice in Black Communities in partnership with World Food Program U.S.A., tied to some of our biggest brands, including Special K, Morningstar Farms, Kashi and Eggo. Our strategy and execution led to another good quarter, as highlighted on Slide #8. At home demand remained elevated, more than offsetting continued softness in away-from-home channels and on the go occasions. Our biggest brands continued to show strong momentum, aided by sustained consumer communication and innovation activity. There why we gained share in most of our key markets and categories around the world. We continue to bring on our planned capacity increases, which will continue to relieve supply tightness and enable us to return to normal levels of merchandising activity as we get through the first half of the year. Our emerging markets businesses accelerated their growth, proving their metal in what are challenging conditions. From a financial perspective, we continue to seek and deliver balanced financial results. The kind we achieved in 2020, and that is what we did again in the first quarter. Strong net sales growth, even despite lapping last year is pandemic-related surge, and we delivered this organic growth across all four regions and all four global category groups for a fifth consecutive quarter. Positive price mix, reflecting revenue growth management actions made all the more important by the recent rise in input cost inflation. Gross profit margin improved year-on-year despite higher costs and faster growth in our emerging markets, including our distributor business in West Africa. Operating profit increased year-on-year despite lapping last year is strong growth ex divestiture, driven by top line momentum and despite a year-on-year increase in brand investment. Cash flow remained strong, and we were able to accelerate share buybacks into the first quarter. So a very good start to 2021 with the potential to put us a little ahead of where we thought we would be through the first half and its extremely difficult comparisons. This enables us to raise the full-year guidance we provided for you in February even amidst what is undeniably an uncertain business environment. So with that, let me turn it over to Amit, who will take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail.\nAmit Banati: Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Slide 10 offers an at-a-glance summary of our financial results for the first quarter. As you can see, they are quite strong. Particularly when considering the year ago growth they were lapping. Specifically, last year is first quarter featured 8% organic growth on net sales and operating profit that grew roughly 8% excluding the impact of the prior year is divestiture. So we generated very good growth on growth. Net sales grew on a one year and a two-year basis. In developed markets, it was aided by shipment timing and at home demand remaining elevated, partially offset by continued softness in away-from-home channels. In emerging markets, we generated sales performance that was better than expected. Currency-neutral adjusted basis operating profit grew on a one year and a two-year basis, driven by the net sales growth and expansion in gross profit margin and good discipline on overhead, all of which more than offset a year-on-year increase in brand building. Clearly, we are seeing good operating leverage from our strong top line growth. Currency-neutral adjusted basis, earnings per share grew on a one-year and a two-year basis despite a higher effective tax rate. And in what is typically our lightest quarter for cash flow, it was stronger than I anticipated for the quarter. Of course, it is down from last year is unusually high first quarter cash flow but as you can see, it is ahead of the pre pandemic 2019 level. Let\u2019s look at these metrics in a little more detail. Slide 11 breaks quarter one net sales growth into its components. Volume declined against last year is math surge, but it was up on a two-year basis. At home demand remained elevated. Emerging markets sustained momentum and we did see favorable timing of shipments in the U.S. as expected. Price/mix was again positive, which is important given the accelerated cost inflation we are seeing. During quarter one, we saw positive pricing in all four regions, reflecting revenue growth management initiatives, and we also saw an overall mix shift back towards snacks. Currency translation was a slight positive in the quarter. As we look to the remainder of 2021, we still expect to see a moderating top line. We faced our toughest volume comparison in quarter two, and we are assuming continued deceleration in at home demand. Slide 12 offers some perspective on our profit margins which held up very well in spite of higher costs. Our gross profit margin in quarter one improved on a one-year and a two-year basis as productivity and price realization were effective at covering accelerated input cost inflation as well as incremental COVID costs against only a partial quarter of those costs in the year-earlier quarter. We also more than offset a mix shift towards emerging markets and particularly towards our distributor business in West Africa. The flow-through of this higher gross profit margin led to an increase in operating profit margin as well as decreased overhead balanced out a high single-digit increase in brand building. The brand building increase reflects the phasing of our commercial plans relative to last year is modest decrease in quarter one at the onset of the pandemic. Even with this year-on-year increase in brand building, we still grew operating profit at a double-digit rate this quarter. As we look to the rest of the year, we obviously faced our toughest gross profit margin comparison in quarter two due to last year is outsized operating leverage that produce, by far the highest gross profit margin over the past couple of years, as you can see on the slide. In the second half, we are working to hold our margin as close as possible to year ago levels. In spite of our mix shift towards emerging markets and accelerated cost inflation. Further down the P&L, we faced our toughest comparison on brand building in quarter two as well. Because last year is quarter two was when we delayed significant brand investment to the second half. That second half investment helped create the momentum we are seeing today. But we return to more typical levels of brand investment in this year is second half. Turning to the remainder of the income statement and Slide 13, we see that our below the line items were relatively neutral to earnings per share in quarter one. As expected, interest expense decreased year-on-year on lower debt and this will continue for the remainder of the year, with quarter four, additionally lapping the nonrecurring $20 million debt redemption expense we recorded last year. Other income was lower year-on-year and modestly lower than what should be its quarterly run rate for the rest of the year. Our effective tax rate of 22.7% was higher than last year is relatively low level and should still turn out to be around 22.5% for the full-year. Average shares outstanding were flattish year-on-year, with the impact of quarter one\u2019s accelerated buybacks to be more pronounced in the coming quarters, resulting in a full-year average shares outstanding that is a little more than 0.5% lower than 2020. Turning to our cash flow on Slide 14. We had a strong start to the year and maintained good financial flexibility. As expected, our cash flow in quarter one was lower than quarter one 2020\u2019s unusually high level, not because of net earnings or working capital both of which were favorable year-on-year, but because of year-on-year swings in accruals and other balance sheet items as well as lapping last year is delayed capital expenditure. However, as you can see on the chart, quarter one 2021\u2019s cash flow was well above that of quarter one 2019 in what is always our lightest cash flow quarter of the year. Net debt is lower year-on-year, even despite our resumption of share buybacks, and we like the state of our balance sheet. As we look to the rest of the year, cash flow will likely remain below last year is COVID-aided levels but still well above 2019 levels. And between our share buybacks, which we were able to accelerate into the first quarter and an increased dividend, we are meaningfully increasing the cash returned to shareowners. I will conclude with a discussion about full-year guidance shown on Slide 15. As Steve mentioned, our strong quarter one performance gives us the confidence to raise our guidance this early in the year. Specifically, our guidance for full-year organic net sales growth moves up to approximately flat year-on-year from our previous guidance of about negative 1%. This would equate to closer to 3% growth on our two-year compound annual growth rate, effectively eliminating the noise of lapping last year is COVID-related surge. Our guidance for currency-neutral adjusted basis operating profit improves a decline of about 1% to 2% year-on-year versus our previous guidance of minus 2%. This equates to closer to 4% growth on a two-year CAGR basis, excluding our divested businesses from the 2019 base. Our guidance for currency-neutral adjusted basis earnings per share increases to growth of about 1% to 2% year-on-year versus our previous guidance of up 1%. And this equates to something around 5% growth on a two-year CAGR basis, excluding our thins divested businesses from the 2019 base. And our guidance for cash flow moves up to a range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion versus our previous guidance of approximately $1.1 billion. We think this guidance is prudent, given that it is early in the year and given a business environment that is somewhat uncertain in terms of pandemic impacts and cost inflation. Obviously, we are pleased with our start to the year. We are in strong financial condition. Our brands and regions are performing well. And we are solidly on track for continued balanced financial delivery on a two-year basis. And with that, let me turn it back to Steve for a review of our major businesses.\nSteven Cahillane: Thanks, Amit. I will start with a quick review of the quarter one results of each of our regions, and then I will go a little deeper into some of our key brands and categories. The region\u2019s net sales and operating profit growth rates in quarter one are shown on Slide 17. You can see that our growth was broad-based, particularly on the more meaningful two-year growth rates. In North America, our organic net sales grew on top of last year is high-growth with elevated at home consumption and strong momentum in key brands as well as favorable timing of shipments between quarters partially offset by continued softness in away-from-home channels. Operating profit also increased year-on-year despite tough underlying comparisons. The two-year trends only further confirmed that this business got off to a good start to the year. Our business in Europe had another good quarter. Its solid one-year organic net sales growth was on top of last year is strong growth, and it was led by accelerated growth in Pringles, resulting operating leverage produced strong operating profit growth. In Latin America, our strong organic net sales growth was driven by Pringles and cereal and the result in operating leverage boosted operating profit as well. Macro conditions in this region are challenging. So this was a terrific way to start the year. And in EMEA, our strong organic net sales growth was led by Multipro, the distributor portion of our business in West Africa, and across the region by Pringles, cereal and noodles, leading to outstanding growth in operating profit as well. Now let\u2019s go a little deeper in some of our categories, markets and channels. We will start with our global category groups, as shown on Slide #18. As you can see from the chart, we grew all four category groups on both a one-year and two-year basis during quarter one despite lapping last year is COVID-related surge and despite continued softness in away-from-home channels. Our largest global category snacks, sustained growth in the first quarter on both a one-year and two-year basis with growth in all four regions, and that is despite the on the go nature of many of its foods and pack formats. This is a testament to the strength of our snacks brands as well as to our ability to adapt messaging and pack formats to current at home occasions. In cereal, we also recorded growth on both a one-year and two-year basis. We saw notable strength in Europe with share gains led by power brands like Tresor and Crunchy Nut. We posted broad-based growth in Latin America with share gains in key markets led by corn flakes. We also recorded strong growth and share performance in EMEA, where our master brand approach is working well in Asia and innovation activity is contributing across the region. As expected, we had a slow start in the U.S. as we limited merchandising activity on supply-constrained brands, but this should improve in the second half as new capacity comes online. Frozen Foods also grew net sales on both a one-year and two-year basis. This predominantly North America business sustained momentum in both Eggo and especially Morningstar Farms, and I will come back to each of them in a moment. And our noodles and other business, which is predominantly in Africa, continue to generate rapid growth both on a one-year and two-year basis as well, with annual net sales approaching $1 billion, this is going to be a growth contributor for some time. So both on a region basis and a category basis, our reshaped portfolio clearly offers growth and diversification. And within each of these regions and categories are world-class brands that continue to grow. Let\u2019s take a look at a few of these important brands. We will start with our largest global brand, Pringles, whose consumption trends for its biggest markets in each of our four regions are shown on Slide 19. This is more than a $2 billion global brand that has demonstrated exceptional momentum for some time in all four regions. During quarter one, this momentum continued with Pringle sustaining growth on top of very strong year ago growth. This was driven by effective brand building, including the incremental consumer communication we did in late 2020, plus important consumer activations in the first quarter, such as our Super Bowl campaign in the U.S. and our gaming oriented commercial activations in Europe. The growth was also augmented by innovation launches including our more intense flavors under the scorching and sub-lines in the U.S. and U.K., respectively, as well as uniquely local flavors in Asian markets. All of these innovations are off to great starts. It is also aided by increased local production in emerging markets, notably in Brazil, where this relatively new local capacity is enabling exceptional growth. Pringles is truly a world-class brand performing extremely well. Here is another really incredible brand, Cheez-It, shown on Slide 20. Its U.S. consumption and share growth has been exceptional over the last several years, and it has continued in the first quarter. The base product line continues to perform well, helped by effective advertising and sports-related activations as well as new flavors and a reformulation of the Grubes sub line. Meanwhile, the Snap sub line is providing incremental growth enough that we had to add capacity in 2020 in only its second year since launch. And Cheez-It is no longer solely a U.S. brand. We expanded into Canada last year. And during the first quarter, it continued to grow rapidly. And in the first quarter, we brought Cheez-It to Brazil, where it is off to a very good start. This is more than $1 billion-plus retail sales brand that continues to outpace its category in the U.S. and one we have begun to expand internationally. And before we move on from our snacks discussion, I want to point out two other power brands in our Snacks portfolio, shown on Slide 21. The since the outbreak of the pandemic, the portable wholesome snacks category has been declining due to fewer on the go occasions. We have continued to gain share of this category, largely because of two brands that have been able to grow their at home consumption. Pop-Tarts continued to post growth on a two-year basis in quarter one, lapping last year is extremely large growth and sustaining multiyear growth momentum. Rice Krispies Treats consumption and share growth has been impressive over the last several years. And this momentum has continued in quarter one, aided by the launch of new home style treats, again, big brands, sustaining momentum. Let\u2019s turn to cereal markets and brands on Slide 22. Behind our one-year and two-year growth in global cereal net sales in the first quarter are strong performances by key brands in key markets. The chart shows our largest international markets of each region, with consumption growth on a two-year basis to avoid distortion from lapping last year is surge in March and share performance on a one-year basis to show how we are competing. In Europe, we have outpaced the category with share gains in key markets like the U.K. which was propelled by power brands like Crunchy Nut and all brand. And in other European markets, we saw particular strength in global brands like Tresor our largest cereal brand in Europe and Extra, a key wellness oriented brand internationally for us. In Canada, where the category got more immediate lift than we did in the year ago quarter, we outpaced the category in this year is first quarter on the strength of brands like global brand, all brand and local jewel vector. We recorded strong growth in share performance in EMEA, led by our largest cereal market in that region, Australia. The outperformance was led by global brands like our Australian version of Raisin Bran as well as local jewels like our wellness oriented Just Right. We saw broad-based cereal growth in Latin America, where we continued to gain share in key markets like Mexico, Brazil, Puerto Rico and Central America. In Mexico, you can see the strong share performance was driven by big brands like Corn Flakes, and Choco Krispies and across the region; our growth was aided by strong innovation. In short, we are seeing the impact of strong brands and strong execution in all of these markets. Let\u2019s discuss U.S. cereal for a moment, shown on Slide 23. As expected, we experienced a slow start in this market as we limited merchandising activity on supply-constrained brands. In scanner data, you can see this in our larger than category decline in percent of volumes sold on promotion. We will be caught up on supply and capacity around midyear, as we have mentioned previously. But in the first quarter, those supply-constrained brands, Frosted Flakes and Fruit Loops two of the stronger brands in the category accounted for all and more of our share decrease in the first quarter. Excluding them, our consumption kept pace with the category. So our underlying business remains in good shape. We are very pleased with our innovation, which not only outpaced the category\u2019s innovation in the first quarter, but is showing very strong velocities already. This includes additions to the Jumbo Snacks line we successfully launched last year as well as Mini-Wheats Cinema rolled, Little Debbie, Special K blueberries and Keto-friendly Kashi Go offerings. So we get back up to adequate supply and capacity and return to a normal commercial calendar particularly in the second half, we expect our U.S. cereal performance to improve and perform like our other big developed markets. Slide 24 calls out another big brand and is sustaining growth on a two-year basis. Eggo\u2019s reliable growth in consumption over the past few years accelerated to nearly 17% in 2020, and gaining nearly two points of share, but leaving us very tight on capacity. In quarter one, Eggo sustained strong two-year growth of plus 5% despite capacity limiting its upside. This is one of the brands for which we are freeing up capacity over the course of this year. And when you add in Kashi, our overall from the griddle consumption outpaced the category on that two-year CAGR basis. Eggo is in really good shape with more capacity coming on. With effective advertising and promising innovation on the way, this is a nearly $1 billion retail sales brand with an outlook for sustained growth. And even better growth is being generated by our leading plant-based brand, Morningstar Farms, shown on Slide 25. Our overall Morningstar Farms brand franchise is over $400 million in retail sales and is poised to sustain strong growth for years to come. This brand\u2019s consumption growth in the first quarter, even on a one-year basis, added to its multiyear growth trend. And with incremental capacity in place, this brand gained share as well. There is no question that consumers are becoming more aware and interested in plant based foods. Morningstar Farms has increased its household penetration in the last year to a level that remains well above any of our competitors. And yet is still only 8%, suggesting significant room to expand. Morningstar Farms is also unique in the breadth of its offerings. This is evident in our share gains across a spectrum of segments in quarter one, ranging from breakfast meats, to breakfast handhelds to sausage to poultry. Our new line is created a whole other occasion for plant based foods. And now we are reaching an expanded consumer base. Our recently launched Incogmeato by Morningstar Farm sub-brand is aimed at incremental flexitarian consumers. It continues to expand retail distribution, both in the refrigerated and frozen isles and it continues to add food service customers. It is early days, but Incogmeato is great food and is showing a lot of promise. Just this week, the National Restaurant Association awarded 2021 Fabby awards for the year is most delicious, unique and exciting food for restaurant operators and consumers. Among those awarded were three Incogmeato products, homestyle chicken tenders, Italian sausage and original broad worst as well as an iconic veg forward offering, Morningstar Farms Chipotle Black Bean Burger. Simply put, Morningstar Farms is the largest brand with the highest penetration, the broadest portfolio and the most occasions in this plant-based category. So we are realizing good underlying momentum across our major category groups and led by world Class brands. Let\u2019s now shift our discussion to geographic markets. Specifically, our emerging markets, highlighted on Slide 26. Emerging markets accounted for more than 20% of our net sales last year, among the highest percentages in our peer group. This is important because these markets represent outstanding long-term growth prospects for packaged food, owing to their population growth, and expanding middle classes. In 2020, despite COVID-related shutdowns of retailers in schools, economic disruption from depressed oil prices and even bouts of political and social unrest. Our geographically diverse emerging markets businesses actually accelerated their net sales growth. This is a credit to our product portfolios, our brand strength, our local supply chains and experienced management teams in these markets. And in the first quarter of this year, despite lapping an unusually strong year ago quarter, we sustained this momentum, even accelerating again. In Africa, our Multipro distributor business grew more than 20% year-on-year in quarter one, even as it lapped strong high-teens growth in the year earlier quarter, and we also continue to grow our Kellogg\u2019s branded noodles business. In Asia, we sustained double-digit growth in Pringles and cereal. In Russia, we recorded double-digit organic growth in cereal and in snacks. And Latin America\u2019s strong quarter one growth was broad-based and led by cereal in Mexico and Pringles in Brazil. And let\u2019s finish up with a couple of channels to call out on Slide 27. In the first quarter, we sustained tremendous growth momentum in e-commerce. The investments we had made in this channel, everything from reorganizing around it, bringing in external talent and development capabilities paid off in a big way in 2020 when our e-commerce sales doubled year-on-year. And in the first quarter, our growth was about 75% even as it lapped the year ago quarter\u2019s acceleration. This is a shopper behavior that is likely to stick. Now roughly 7% of our total company sales, we know that our brands and categories play well in this channel, and we are building this business for the long term. Of course, on the other end of the spectrum, during the pandemic are away-from-home channels, which have declined sharply amidst shutdowns and restrictions. The slide shows that our U.S. away-from-home business continued to moderate its declines as measured on an average two-year basis to better gauge the trend. Important to know is that we have not been sitting still waiting for consumer mobility to resume and away-from-home outlets to reopen. We have been actively securing future business, signing up new accounts for brands ranging from Rx to Morningstar Farms and Incogmeato. These actions today will pay off well into the future. Let\u2019s wrap up with a brief summary on Slide number 29. Quarter one 2021 was yet another quarter of good performance and investment in the future. We have sustained strong momentum in most of our biggest world class brands, never having let up an innovation or communication with consumers. We are unlocking capacity so we can resume full commercial activity in some of the foods and brands that had reached capacity limitations after good growth in recent years and acceleration since the pandemic. This added capacity will continue to come on stream during the year, continuing to improve service levels and return to full merchandising activity with our retail partners. Our emerging markets have not only managed through challenging macro environments over the past year, they\u2019ve actually accelerated their growth. And we continue to build scale in these long-term growth markets. We are leveraging capabilities that we have been enhancing over the past few years from data and analytics to e-commerce to innovation. These capabilities have only become even more important since the pandemic. Our cash flow and balance sheet are strong, and we have increased cash return to share owners while maintaining financial flexibility. Our results for quarter one were particularly strong, but more importantly, they reflected high-quality balanced financial delivery. We sustained net sales growth, expanded gross profit margin, remain disciplined on overhead and invested behind our brands and still delivered growth in operating profit and earnings per share, leading to strong cash flow. All of which adds up to an early increase in our full-year outlook. As always, I want to salute our 31,000 employees whose dedication and creativity have made this performance possible despite the most challenging business conditions. And with that, we would be happy to take any questions you might have.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Palmer: The question about the 2021 guidance and the implications of that. You had a 3% two-year CAGR that is implied by that. And obviously, this has been an unusual year in 2021. Even if we look past 2020, there is still some COVID related factors. You mentioned supply chain. I think you would take a 3% organic growth rate most years. But could you maybe talk about that 3% CAGR? What has sort of been a tailwind? What has been headwinds? And how would we think about that as you are really executing this turnaround plan, like how you are basically setting up for 2022 and beyond?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Thanks, David. I will start, and Amit can build. But what I would say is it is important to look at those two year CAGRs, as you point out, that is what we have been talking about because 2020 was such an unusual year. Right. But what\u2019s underlying our confidence in that CAGR is the brand performances that we talked about as we went through the prepared remarks. Our snacks business, our frozen business, our veg business, our international business, our emerging markets business, all performing very strong and if you think about our new guidance for 2021, essentially, just from a top line basis, we are saying flat. So what many companies thought of 2020 when there were COVID beneficiaries would be a high watermark is, in fact, we are going to lap that. And so that is because of the strength of our brands, the execution in the marketplace and the plans that we have put in place. So Amit, do you want to\u2026\nAmit Banati: Yes. I think it reflects the strength of our portfolio, and you are seeing that come through I think from a pure guidance standpoint, we are expecting that elevated demand will moderate a little bit from quarter one. So I think that is what\u2019s built into the guidance. We are expecting growth in emerging markets to sustain, maybe not at the double-digit rates that we saw in quarter one. But certainly, we continue to expect growth in the emerging markets.\nOperator: The next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.\nThomas Palmer: It is Tom Palmer on for Ken. Wanted to ask on the inflation picture. So during the prepared remarks, you made mention of rising cost inflation. Could you provide a bit more detail on the inflation you are seeing right now and then what you expect to see as the year plays out and just the timing of your hedges rolling off and then your comfort in terms of offsetting it? I guess, really the major tool, I\u2019m curious about color on is how you think about list pricing. And instituting that this year?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Thanks, Tom. So what I would say is we have talked about the inflationary environment, which is real. We have also talked about the hedging, and I will let Amit build on that, that we have got in place for the first half of the year as well as the back half of the year. On the pricing front and just the cost pressure front, what I would say is we have a host of tools at our disposal. So we think about the suite of offerings we want to always start with productivity and drive productivity as hard as we possibly can. And then we are going to look to revenue growth management and the tools that we have in revenue growth management, whether they be price package architecture, whether they be pricing, which would include list pricing. All of those are at our disposal. But at the end of the day, we have to earn that price in the marketplace, through investing in our brands, through innovating through putting the types of performances that we have been able to put against our brands, which puts us in a good position to have the confidence to slightly raise our guidance even despite increased cost pressures that are quite real. Amit, do you want to?\nAmit Banati: Yes. I think cost for inflation, no question, it is accelerated. I think we are now looking at it being in the high end of the mid- single-digit rate for 2021. We are seeing it across our cost basket from exchange-traded commodities to diesel and energy, ocean freight; we have seen a spike in ocean freight as well. I think all of that has been incorporated into the guidance that we provided today. From a hedging perspective, we are about 76% hedged on the exchange-traded commodities. Obviously, there are other cost pressures outside those as well. But I think we have reflected that in our guidance. And you would have seen that in our quarter one results, we had strong pricing and mix come through. And as Steve mentioned, it is across the whole range of levers, including productivity, including list price increases, including trade optimization and price pack architecture. So the whole suite of revenue growth management tools.\nThomas Palmer: Okay. And just to clarify, where would you have been in the first quarter in terms of that inflationary environment?\nAmit Banati: I think similar levels. Though, obviously, it is accelerating through the year. And then obviously, in quarter one, we were in more hedged than in the later part of the year, as you would expect.\nOperator: The next question is from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nStephen Powers: Maybe just to round out that conversation a little bit more. I think you had said on the last quarter that you were targeting 2021 gross margins ahead of 2019 levels. Is that I guess, first off, is that still realistic? Or has that been ratcheted down a bit and you are thinking. And then given that relatively extensive coverage from a hedge position, it would appear, just given the cost curves that we are seeing in the spot market, it implies some residual inflation carrying over into 2022. I don\u2019t know if there is a way you can kind of frame the extent of that carryover to 2022. But I\u2019m really curious about, given that, if I\u2019m right about that outlook, does that does that impact your plans around the timing of pricing or other discretionary spending at all as 2021 progresses.\nAmit Banati: Yes. So I think our goal is still to expand our gross profit margin on a two-year basis. So I think that is still our goal. And in that context, from a 2021 standpoint, obviously, we were ahead in quarter one. Quarter two is going to be our biggest lap as we lapped last year is outsized operating leverage. And then for the balance of 2021, our goal would be to be as close to flat as possible. So that is kind of the way we are thinking about gross profit margin. Too early to talk about 2022 right now. But certainly, as Steve mentioned, from a revenue growth management standpoint, we are looking at a whole range of tools to offset the inflation that we see.\nOperator: The next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: One quick housekeeping question and then a more robust question. First, housekeeping, I thought I heard you say that the markets benefited from shipment timing in the quarter. Am I right? Did I pick that up; can you clarify and provide any sort of quantification?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. So we definitely did benefit somewhat from shipment timing. And if you think about - back to quarter one 2020 where U.S. consumption growth exceeded shipments fairly markedly because of the surge. You almost have the mere reflection in quarter one 2021 where the reverse was true, where U.S. net sales growth exceeded consumption. And as we have said many times in the past, consumption is a good guide. It evens out over time. And some of this was clearly borrowed from or taken from quarter four, which we talked about when we did our quarter four call. But that is essentially where the net of Amit, you want to?\nAmit Banati: Yes. I think just to build on what Steve said, Jason, in addition to last year is factors and timing versus last year, as we had mentioned in our last call, some of this came from quarter four. Most of it, I would say, the timing came from quarter four. There is been a little bit as it relates to quarter two. So there was some shipment ahead of activities, but most of it came from quarter four.\nJason English: Okay. And then on those activities, Steve, we certainly heard you talk a lot about bringing merchandising activity back to try to get the market share going the right way. How do we think about that in context of the price equation? I mean, the pricing we saw this quarter was phenomenally robust, particularly in EMs, but also in DMs as we think about the glide path forward, net of this more merchandising activity, can you hold the serve like the levels we are looking at or should we expect sort of a migration to net neutral, but how a for the back half of the year, at least within DMs?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. No, thanks, Jason. I would say, obviously, we can\u2019t comment on forward-looking pricing and promotions and so forth. But what we are seeing, what we would expect is a gradual return to normal levels of merchandising activity. As more and more people start to emerge from the pandemic, as capacity for ourselves and others starts to become more normalized. I would just expect that you\u2019ll see a more normal return to levels; I wouldn\u2019t see anything really above that. I wouldn\u2019t see the macro conditions that would drive that. And so yes, I think we can hold serve. And we are off to a good start. It is clear the areas where we want to work on, where we need to work on. And it is clear where we have really good momentum, and we want to continue to push against that as well.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler.\nMichael Lavery: Can you give a sense of how your conversations with retailers are going with respect to pricing? And maybe specifically, are they more sensitive to list pricing and more receptive to other approaches? Or is it similar across the board? Just kind of love to get a temperature check on where they are and how much kind of wiggle room you have from here out?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Thanks, Michael. So obviously, I\u2019m not going to comment on any specific customers, but we have a mantra here that we talk about all the time, we have to earn the pricing that we get in the marketplace. Clearly, there is an inflationary environment that is real. Clearly that is across broad swaths of the economy. And clearly, there is been a lot of reporting on that. But we approach it with the humility that says we have got to invest in our brands. We have got to bring innovation. We have got to do everything that we can to continue to earn our place in the marketplace. But I would also say, we did raise guidance, and we are talking about holding as close to possible to our gross margins. So that reflects the type of confidence that we have that we will be able to get through this by managing our price, mix, innovation with our customers.\nMichael Lavery: And how much can you balance the EBIT margin targets with the brand spending and inflation pressures. Is there some interplay there or do you want to protect the brand spend specifically to allow pricing?\nSteven Cahillane: Well, we have said in the past, we like the brand building that we have got in place. We like the levels that we have in place. In the back half of last year, we were very purposeful in saying what we pulled from the second quarter we are putting in the back half of the year because brands need investments. And we kept to our overall budget from last year, although it was back-half weighted, and that clearly gave us momentum as we entered 2021, whether it be the Pringles example in the U.S. and in Europe. But we like our levels of brand building spending. We think they are important. They clearly give us the opportunity to drive our brands. And as I said, earn what we get in the marketplace. And so I think we are well balanced. I think we are confident. Again, we raised our guidance based on that. And it is still very early in the year, so there is a lot of uncertainty at play. But we like the way it is shaped up. We like the way it started, and we like our plan going forward from a brand-building perspective and a profit delivery perspective.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Growe with Stifel.\nChris Growe: Just a bit of a follow-on to that last answer and to Michael\u2019s question. I guess, just to get a sense of the first quarter profit performance and EPS performance being so much stronger than expected. I guess I want to understand, were there any unique factors. We talked about some maybe some over shipment in relation to consumption. But just to understand kind of how that kind of took hold during the quarter and then the degree to which inflation, I guess, is obviously picking up through the year. Is that picking up more than you expected, such that there is maybe more of a limitation on earnings growth in the remaining quarters. It just seems with this degree of outperformance in the first quarter that it would have led to a stronger performance for the year overall, unless there is some other unique factors I\u2019m not just incorporating here.\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Thanks, Chris. I will start, and Amit can build as well. We did raise guidance, and I think I heard your question, why not more, but we are being prudent. Obviously, we are still in a pandemic, where others are really not even giving guidance beyond the next quarter. We are trying to be as helpful and as transparent as possible. We still have COVID. Obviously, we have lots of challenges in emerging markets based on COVID and other things, but we are off to a good start. And we are confident, and we feel like we can manage all the things that you mentioned, the inflationary environment, the potential disruptions, but we want to be prudent, and we want to be able to deliver what we say we are going to deliver.\nAmit Banati: And just to build on that, maybe a couple of additional points. Just on the shape of the year. So I think quarter two is when we have got the biggest lap, right. So if you look at it from a gross margin standpoint, that was the quarter where we saw the operational - the outsized operational leverage come through. So we are going to lap that in quarter two. Our quarter two was also when we delayed our brand-building into the rest of the year. And just if you recall, quarter two operating profit last year, in 2020, was up 24%. So I think that will just give you a sense of the lap ahead of us and just the shape of the year. I think, like I said, from a gross margin standpoint, in the second half, we target to get as close to flat as possible, recognizing that inflation continues to rise and recognizing that we are probably about 76% hedged. And the SG&A comp should moderate in the second half.\nOperator: That is next question is from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: So two quick ones from me. First is just a follow-up on some of the inflation and commodity question. I mean, we have heard for some other companies, there has been - with some commodities like soybean oil, for instance, where availability is actually a question. So can you just, I guess, give us some insight in terms of your confidence in the availability or your ability to source the raw materials you need?\nAmit Banati: Yes. I think from a sourcing standpoint, we feel very confident in terms of our diverse supplier base. So while, obviously, with ocean freight and containers and the Suez crisis, there is been pressure in the system. But I think from a supply and a security of supply standpoint, we are confident about that.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. And then, Steve, it is been a few years now since the supply for balanced growth and I know there is been some disruption with COVID over the last year or 13-months or so. But I guess, just stepping back, can you just give us a little bit of insight in terms of like where you think you are maybe ahead of what your expectations would have been, kind of what\u2019s in line? And then maybe just where you still think there is some work to do.\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Thanks, Bryan. So I would say we are really where we want to be, right. We are always constructively discontent. We want to do better. We demand of ourselves to do better. But when you think about things like shaping a growth portfolio, that came through and it delivered. The divestiture is behind us. It was a smart thing to do. It was the right thing to do. But you see our emerging markets, you see our snacks brands, you see our many of our portfolio brands really executing well for us. When we think about perfect service and perfect store, built perfectly for the type of pressure that we had to face last year and ongoing and facing this year. We talk about building world-class brands. And we put some investment surges into our brands unapologetically in the past. And because of those things, before the pandemic, I would remind you that we exited the year before the pandemic with 2.7% organic sales growth, right? And we were getting to balance. And then the surge happened and COVID happened. And here we are, we have had this unbelievable sampling opportunity, this reappraisal opportunity, which we have aimed to make the most of but when you look at the two-year stacks and you look at our portfolio and you look at our performance, we are delivering top line growth. We are back to growth reliably and for a lot of quarters now. And we are delivering balanced growth as well. And it is through the strength of our brands and the strength of the execution of our strategy. So we remain eager to do better. We remain hungry, but I think there is no question that deploy for growth has delivered, and we are back to a balanced growth performance.\nAmit Banati: I think the only thing I would add is that we delivered balanced delivery last year. Our goal is to grow our gross margin on a two-year basis. And our cash flow convergence. Last year was an exceptional year. But even if you set that aside, our goal is to increase our cash flow conversion. And our new guidance on cash flow would indicate around 75% to 80% conversion.\nOperator: Our next question is from Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nRobert Moskow: The 5% pricing or price mix in the quarter is a lot higher than what I had modeled, and I think others had too. I think the perception was that the pricing from a list basis and maybe revenue growth management, too, would come later in the year as your hedges roll over. Does this mean that you can accelerate pricing even above 5% as the year goes on or is there something unusual about the 5% maybe related to the timing of promotional programs that would indicate that, that is your peak.\nAmit Banati: Yes. I think most of the price mix came from pricing in the quarter. And like I mentioned, that was the whole range of tools across all the regions. I think in some of our EMs, we took significant pricing to cover for commodity. And remember, in some of these markets, we have also had transactional ForEx impacts through the back half of 2020 into 2021. So you have seen pricing to offset that come through in the pricing. I think we also benefited from mix. With snacks growth coming back certainly from a mix standpoint, that is a positive. So that is kind of what drove the quarter one results.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. So as snacks comes back, that boosts your price mix, but what does it do to your gross margin and operating margin? Is that dilutive to both or just one of those?\nAmit Banati: Yes. We don\u2019t get into the by category profitability, but I would say that, yes, I mean, it is kind of at the mix level, at the margin level, it kind of is neutral-ish at the price level, it is accretive.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.\nAndrew Lazar: Just a quick one, Steve, on the capacity additions that you talked about. I\u2019m curious if you can maybe dimensionalize a little bit how much of that capacity, broadly speaking, would be sort of internal versus, let\u2019s say, leveraging external third-party sources? And really, the reason I ask is just because to the extent that more of the capacity is internal that has the implications for, obviously, your level of conviction around stickiness of demand or elevated levels of demand going forward, let\u2019s say, versus pre pandemic versus if you were doing more of this externally.\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Thanks, Andrew. So I would say most of what we talked about is internal capacity, right? Many times, we look to external capacity when we are starting out. So if you look at like a Cheez-It Snap\u2019d line, we might start with the first-line being external, but I got lots of conviction that second-line was internal. And so when we talk about cereal capacity, when we talk about Eggo capacity, we are talking about internal capacity building and expansion. So you can take from that, that there is real conviction. But what I would say is we are not building based on any kind of pandemic that is going to go away. We are building on what we really need, right? And so like others, we operate our capacity pretty tightly, right? And historically, when you are in categories that are growing low single digits, you would expect that, the surge created a whole different set of circumstances but as I said, 2020 is not really going to be our high watermark, right? And so we are going to lap those things in 2021. And we are going to need the capacity to do that in things like certain elements of our ready-to-eat cereal in Eggo, in some of our Cheez-It lines, but we are in pretty good shape. And so it is all embedded in our guidance, and we feel like we have got a good plan.\nJohn Renwick: I think, operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: And that question comes from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies.\nRob Dickerson: Great. Maybe two quick questions. And one, just a quick follow-up from Andrew on capacity. As that comes on, it sounds like increasingly later this year and then into next year, is that just one of the drivers very simplistically as to why you might feel a little bit better on the gross margin side. I mean, I would assume, right as that comes on, third-party goes away, but then maybe there is also a double positive effect by just bringing more in internally off the volume leverage piece?\nSteven Cahillane: Not really, Rob. A couple of years ago, when we were doing a lot of on the go. We were attacking the on-the-go occasions, and we did a lot of third party, but we also had a lot of manual work being done, that was the case. But now we are more in a normalized environment where we are building capacity based on increasing demand. So not really.\nRob Dickerson: Okay, great. Cool. And then just other quickly, just on the EM pricing piece. I know you said right, there is some transactional impact, obviously, and then also on the cost inflation side, it was very high, right, in EMEA, it is impressive. like was there pricing in there that you would say could also have just been opportunistic given what you are seeing across all of those countries within that segment such that you weren\u2019t pricing that much historically, but maybe there was, like you said, some of that brand building could have been targeted to some of the areas within EMEA. And therefore, you kind of stuck in and took maybe a little bit more pricing that FX or cost inflation may have excuse me I suggested. That is it.\nAmit Banati: No, I think just looking at the cost situation, commodities, ForEx, and obviously, we have seen inflation in both. So I think trying to preserve your margins while also balancing out volume growth and share, I think, and triangulating between those drivers.\nJohn Renwick: Alright, well that concludes it. Thanks very much, everyone, for your interest. And if you have follow-up questions, please do not hesitate to call us.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Steven Cahillane",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are doing well and staying healthy. Here at Kellogg, I'm continuously impressed by the way our organization has remained focused and engaged in executing through what are undeniably challenging circumstances, both at work and at home. Keeping employees safe remains job number one. And in quarter one; we continued to execute safety protocols while following the guidance of local health authorities. Supplying the world with food continued to require agility, including temporary labor and incremental capacity. And of course, we continue to actively support our communities. After all, the pandemic is not behind us. In fact, in some parts of the world, we are seeing it accelerate, and our thoughts and prayers go out to all those affected. Turning to Slide 6. Our deploy for balanced growth strategy remains as relevant and effective as ever during this pandemic. Its growth boosters continue to do their job. As much as anything else, this pandemic has prompted a shift in eating occasions. Our focus on occasions continue to be evident in the first quarter in our tailored consumer messaging and an innovation geared towards specific occasions. The portfolio that we have shaped toward growth has benefited from balance of convenient meals, snacking that can be done at home, plant-based foods and sustained growth in emerging markets. Our building of world-class brands has been evident in our commitment to continued equity building communication as well as leveraging our data and analytics to devise creative ways to reach new consumers and sustain momentum in the marketplace. And our commitment to perfect service, perfect store, tested by the sudden and sharp rise in demand has forced us to get creative around ways to increase throughput, even if it meant temporarily holding back and merchandising activity to ensure inventory and incurring incremental logistics cost to get food to our customers. And we continue to grow rapidly in e-commerce, leveraging our enhanced capabilities there. Environmental, social and governance is not a new area of focus for Kellogg. It has been embedded in our history and strategy for a long, long time. Our ESG oriented better days boosters always a key element of our strategy, have become more important to our communities, employees, customers and consumers. At CAGNY, a few months ago, we discussed our global better days purpose and strategy and on Slide #7, you can see that we continue to progress in this area, addressing the interconnected issues of health, hunger relief and climate. On nourishing with our foods, we have continued to innovate and renovate our foods, providing choices across wellness and indulgence and during the quarter, our Kashi became the first organic cereal to be authorized for the women, infants and children program in the United States. On feeding people in need, we have remained in an elevated level of donations making accelerated progress toward our goal of feeding 375 million families. During the first quarter, Pop-Tarts joined with the United Way to raise money for school vegetable gardens. On nurturing our planet, we announced during the first quarter, our commitment to achieve over 50% renewable electricity to address Kellogg manufacturing globally by the end of 2022, and we celebrated women farmers as part of International Women's Day. And under living our founders' values, we launched in the first quarter our new equity, diversity and inclusion vision and strategy to all employees in all four regions. Aligned with those values, we launched a campaign called a Call for Food Justice in Black Communities in partnership with World Food Program U.S.A., tied to some of our biggest brands, including Special K, Morningstar Farms, Kashi and Eggo. Our strategy and execution led to another good quarter, as highlighted on Slide #8. At home demand remained elevated, more than offsetting continued softness in away-from-home channels and on the go occasions. Our biggest brands continued to show strong momentum, aided by sustained consumer communication and innovation activity. There why we gained share in most of our key markets and categories around the world. We continue to bring on our planned capacity increases, which will continue to relieve supply tightness and enable us to return to normal levels of merchandising activity as we get through the first half of the year. Our emerging markets businesses accelerated their growth, proving their metal in what are challenging conditions. From a financial perspective, we continue to seek and deliver balanced financial results. The kind we achieved in 2020, and that is what we did again in the first quarter. Strong net sales growth, even despite lapping last year is pandemic-related surge, and we delivered this organic growth across all four regions and all four global category groups for a fifth consecutive quarter. Positive price mix, reflecting revenue growth management actions made all the more important by the recent rise in input cost inflation. Gross profit margin improved year-on-year despite higher costs and faster growth in our emerging markets, including our distributor business in West Africa. Operating profit increased year-on-year despite lapping last year is strong growth ex divestiture, driven by top line momentum and despite a year-on-year increase in brand investment. Cash flow remained strong, and we were able to accelerate share buybacks into the first quarter. So a very good start to 2021 with the potential to put us a little ahead of where we thought we would be through the first half and its extremely difficult comparisons. This enables us to raise the full-year guidance we provided for you in February even amidst what is undeniably an uncertain business environment. So with that, let me turn it over to Amit, who will take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail. Thanks, Amit. I will start with a quick review of the quarter one results of each of our regions, and then I will go a little deeper into some of our key brands and categories. The region's net sales and operating profit growth rates in quarter one are shown on Slide 17. You can see that our growth was broad-based, particularly on the more meaningful two-year growth rates. In North America, our organic net sales grew on top of last year is high-growth with elevated at home consumption and strong momentum in key brands as well as favorable timing of shipments between quarters partially offset by continued softness in away-from-home channels. Operating profit also increased year-on-year despite tough underlying comparisons. The two-year trends only further confirmed that this business got off to a good start to the year. Our business in Europe had another good quarter. Its solid one-year organic net sales growth was on top of last year is strong growth, and it was led by accelerated growth in Pringles, resulting operating leverage produced strong operating profit growth. In Latin America, our strong organic net sales growth was driven by Pringles and cereal and the result in operating leverage boosted operating profit as well. Macro conditions in this region are challenging. So this was a terrific way to start the year. And in EMEA, our strong organic net sales growth was led by Multipro, the distributor portion of our business in West Africa, and across the region by Pringles, cereal and noodles, leading to outstanding growth in operating profit as well. Now let's go a little deeper in some of our categories, markets and channels. We will start with our global category groups, as shown on Slide #18. As you can see from the chart, we grew all four category groups on both a one-year and two-year basis during quarter one despite lapping last year is COVID-related surge and despite continued softness in away-from-home channels. Our largest global category snacks, sustained growth in the first quarter on both a one-year and two-year basis with growth in all four regions, and that is despite the on the go nature of many of its foods and pack formats. This is a testament to the strength of our snacks brands as well as to our ability to adapt messaging and pack formats to current at home occasions. In cereal, we also recorded growth on both a one-year and two-year basis. We saw notable strength in Europe with share gains led by power brands like Tresor and Crunchy Nut. We posted broad-based growth in Latin America with share gains in key markets led by corn flakes. We also recorded strong growth and share performance in EMEA, where our master brand approach is working well in Asia and innovation activity is contributing across the region. As expected, we had a slow start in the U.S. as we limited merchandising activity on supply-constrained brands, but this should improve in the second half as new capacity comes online. Frozen Foods also grew net sales on both a one-year and two-year basis. This predominantly North America business sustained momentum in both Eggo and especially Morningstar Farms, and I will come back to each of them in a moment. And our noodles and other business, which is predominantly in Africa, continue to generate rapid growth both on a one-year and two-year basis as well, with annual net sales approaching $1 billion, this is going to be a growth contributor for some time. So both on a region basis and a category basis, our reshaped portfolio clearly offers growth and diversification. And within each of these regions and categories are world-class brands that continue to grow. Let's take a look at a few of these important brands. We will start with our largest global brand, Pringles, whose consumption trends for its biggest markets in each of our four regions are shown on Slide 19. This is more than a $2 billion global brand that has demonstrated exceptional momentum for some time in all four regions. During quarter one, this momentum continued with Pringle sustaining growth on top of very strong year ago growth. This was driven by effective brand building, including the incremental consumer communication we did in late 2020, plus important consumer activations in the first quarter, such as our Super Bowl campaign in the U.S. and our gaming oriented commercial activations in Europe. The growth was also augmented by innovation launches including our more intense flavors under the scorching and sub-lines in the U.S. and U.K., respectively, as well as uniquely local flavors in Asian markets. All of these innovations are off to great starts. It is also aided by increased local production in emerging markets, notably in Brazil, where this relatively new local capacity is enabling exceptional growth. Pringles is truly a world-class brand performing extremely well. Here is another really incredible brand, Cheez-It, shown on Slide 20. Its U.S. consumption and share growth has been exceptional over the last several years, and it has continued in the first quarter. The base product line continues to perform well, helped by effective advertising and sports-related activations as well as new flavors and a reformulation of the Grubes sub line. Meanwhile, the Snap sub line is providing incremental growth enough that we had to add capacity in 2020 in only its second year since launch. And Cheez-It is no longer solely a U.S. brand. We expanded into Canada last year. And during the first quarter, it continued to grow rapidly. And in the first quarter, we brought Cheez-It to Brazil, where it is off to a very good start. This is more than $1 billion-plus retail sales brand that continues to outpace its category in the U.S. and one we have begun to expand internationally. And before we move on from our snacks discussion, I want to point out two other power brands in our Snacks portfolio, shown on Slide 21. The since the outbreak of the pandemic, the portable wholesome snacks category has been declining due to fewer on the go occasions. We have continued to gain share of this category, largely because of two brands that have been able to grow their at home consumption. Pop-Tarts continued to post growth on a two-year basis in quarter one, lapping last year is extremely large growth and sustaining multiyear growth momentum. Rice Krispies Treats consumption and share growth has been impressive over the last several years. And this momentum has continued in quarter one, aided by the launch of new home style treats, again, big brands, sustaining momentum. Let's turn to cereal markets and brands on Slide 22. Behind our one-year and two-year growth in global cereal net sales in the first quarter are strong performances by key brands in key markets. The chart shows our largest international markets of each region, with consumption growth on a two-year basis to avoid distortion from lapping last year is surge in March and share performance on a one-year basis to show how we are competing. In Europe, we have outpaced the category with share gains in key markets like the U.K. which was propelled by power brands like Crunchy Nut and all brand. And in other European markets, we saw particular strength in global brands like Tresor our largest cereal brand in Europe and Extra, a key wellness oriented brand internationally for us. In Canada, where the category got more immediate lift than we did in the year ago quarter, we outpaced the category in this year is first quarter on the strength of brands like global brand, all brand and local jewel vector. We recorded strong growth in share performance in EMEA, led by our largest cereal market in that region, Australia. The outperformance was led by global brands like our Australian version of Raisin Bran as well as local jewels like our wellness oriented Just Right. We saw broad-based cereal growth in Latin America, where we continued to gain share in key markets like Mexico, Brazil, Puerto Rico and Central America. In Mexico, you can see the strong share performance was driven by big brands like Corn Flakes, and Choco Krispies and across the region; our growth was aided by strong innovation. In short, we are seeing the impact of strong brands and strong execution in all of these markets. Let's discuss U.S. cereal for a moment, shown on Slide 23. As expected, we experienced a slow start in this market as we limited merchandising activity on supply-constrained brands. In scanner data, you can see this in our larger than category decline in percent of volumes sold on promotion. We will be caught up on supply and capacity around midyear, as we have mentioned previously. But in the first quarter, those supply-constrained brands, Frosted Flakes and Fruit Loops two of the stronger brands in the category accounted for all and more of our share decrease in the first quarter. Excluding them, our consumption kept pace with the category. So our underlying business remains in good shape. We are very pleased with our innovation, which not only outpaced the category's innovation in the first quarter, but is showing very strong velocities already. This includes additions to the Jumbo Snacks line we successfully launched last year as well as Mini-Wheats Cinema rolled, Little Debbie, Special K blueberries and Keto-friendly Kashi Go offerings. So we get back up to adequate supply and capacity and return to a normal commercial calendar particularly in the second half, we expect our U.S. cereal performance to improve and perform like our other big developed markets. Slide 24 calls out another big brand and is sustaining growth on a two-year basis. Eggo's reliable growth in consumption over the past few years accelerated to nearly 17% in 2020, and gaining nearly two points of share, but leaving us very tight on capacity. In quarter one, Eggo sustained strong two-year growth of plus 5% despite capacity limiting its upside. This is one of the brands for which we are freeing up capacity over the course of this year. And when you add in Kashi, our overall from the griddle consumption outpaced the category on that two-year CAGR basis. Eggo is in really good shape with more capacity coming on. With effective advertising and promising innovation on the way, this is a nearly $1 billion retail sales brand with an outlook for sustained growth. And even better growth is being generated by our leading plant-based brand, Morningstar Farms, shown on Slide 25. Our overall Morningstar Farms brand franchise is over $400 million in retail sales and is poised to sustain strong growth for years to come. This brand's consumption growth in the first quarter, even on a one-year basis, added to its multiyear growth trend. And with incremental capacity in place, this brand gained share as well. There is no question that consumers are becoming more aware and interested in plant based foods. Morningstar Farms has increased its household penetration in the last year to a level that remains well above any of our competitors. And yet is still only 8%, suggesting significant room to expand. Morningstar Farms is also unique in the breadth of its offerings. This is evident in our share gains across a spectrum of segments in quarter one, ranging from breakfast meats, to breakfast handhelds to sausage to poultry. Our new line is created a whole other occasion for plant based foods. And now we are reaching an expanded consumer base. Our recently launched Incogmeato by Morningstar Farm sub-brand is aimed at incremental flexitarian consumers. It continues to expand retail distribution, both in the refrigerated and frozen isles and it continues to add food service customers. It is early days, but Incogmeato is great food and is showing a lot of promise. Just this week, the National Restaurant Association awarded 2021 Fabby awards for the year is most delicious, unique and exciting food for restaurant operators and consumers. Among those awarded were three Incogmeato products, homestyle chicken tenders, Italian sausage and original broad worst as well as an iconic veg forward offering, Morningstar Farms Chipotle Black Bean Burger. Simply put, Morningstar Farms is the largest brand with the highest penetration, the broadest portfolio and the most occasions in this plant-based category. So we are realizing good underlying momentum across our major category groups and led by world Class brands. Let's now shift our discussion to geographic markets. Specifically, our emerging markets, highlighted on Slide 26. Emerging markets accounted for more than 20% of our net sales last year, among the highest percentages in our peer group. This is important because these markets represent outstanding long-term growth prospects for packaged food, owing to their population growth, and expanding middle classes. In 2020, despite COVID-related shutdowns of retailers in schools, economic disruption from depressed oil prices and even bouts of political and social unrest. Our geographically diverse emerging markets businesses actually accelerated their net sales growth. This is a credit to our product portfolios, our brand strength, our local supply chains and experienced management teams in these markets. And in the first quarter of this year, despite lapping an unusually strong year ago quarter, we sustained this momentum, even accelerating again. In Africa, our Multipro distributor business grew more than 20% year-on-year in quarter one, even as it lapped strong high-teens growth in the year earlier quarter, and we also continue to grow our Kellogg's branded noodles business. In Asia, we sustained double-digit growth in Pringles and cereal. In Russia, we recorded double-digit organic growth in cereal and in snacks. And Latin America's strong quarter one growth was broad-based and led by cereal in Mexico and Pringles in Brazil. And let's finish up with a couple of channels to call out on Slide 27. In the first quarter, we sustained tremendous growth momentum in e-commerce. The investments we had made in this channel, everything from reorganizing around it, bringing in external talent and development capabilities paid off in a big way in 2020 when our e-commerce sales doubled year-on-year. And in the first quarter, our growth was about 75% even as it lapped the year ago quarter's acceleration. This is a shopper behavior that is likely to stick. Now roughly 7% of our total company sales, we know that our brands and categories play well in this channel, and we are building this business for the long term. Of course, on the other end of the spectrum, during the pandemic are away-from-home channels, which have declined sharply amidst shutdowns and restrictions. The slide shows that our U.S. away-from-home business continued to moderate its declines as measured on an average two-year basis to better gauge the trend. Important to know is that we have not been sitting still waiting for consumer mobility to resume and away-from-home outlets to reopen. We have been actively securing future business, signing up new accounts for brands ranging from Rx to Morningstar Farms and Incogmeato. These actions today will pay off well into the future. Let's wrap up with a brief summary on Slide number 29. Quarter one 2021 was yet another quarter of good performance and investment in the future. We have sustained strong momentum in most of our biggest world class brands, never having let up an innovation or communication with consumers. We are unlocking capacity so we can resume full commercial activity in some of the foods and brands that had reached capacity limitations after good growth in recent years and acceleration since the pandemic. This added capacity will continue to come on stream during the year, continuing to improve service levels and return to full merchandising activity with our retail partners. Our emerging markets have not only managed through challenging macro environments over the past year, they've actually accelerated their growth. And we continue to build scale in these long-term growth markets. We are leveraging capabilities that we have been enhancing over the past few years from data and analytics to e-commerce to innovation. These capabilities have only become even more important since the pandemic. Our cash flow and balance sheet are strong, and we have increased cash return to share owners while maintaining financial flexibility. Our results for quarter one were particularly strong, but more importantly, they reflected high-quality balanced financial delivery. We sustained net sales growth, expanded gross profit margin, remain disciplined on overhead and invested behind our brands and still delivered growth in operating profit and earnings per share, leading to strong cash flow. All of which adds up to an early increase in our full-year outlook. As always, I want to salute our 31,000 employees whose dedication and creativity have made this performance possible despite the most challenging business conditions. And with that, we would be happy to take any questions you might have. Yes. Thanks, David. I will start, and Amit can build. But what I would say is it is important to look at those two year CAGRs, as you point out, that is what we have been talking about because 2020 was such an unusual year. Right. But what's underlying our confidence in that CAGR is the brand performances that we talked about as we went through the prepared remarks. Our snacks business, our frozen business, our veg business, our international business, our emerging markets business, all performing very strong and if you think about our new guidance for 2021, essentially, just from a top line basis, we are saying flat. So what many companies thought of 2020 when there were COVID beneficiaries would be a high watermark is, in fact, we are going to lap that. And so that is because of the strength of our brands, the execution in the marketplace and the plans that we have put in place. So Amit, do you want to... Yes. Thanks, Tom. So what I would say is we have talked about the inflationary environment, which is real. We have also talked about the hedging, and I will let Amit build on that, that we have got in place for the first half of the year as well as the back half of the year. On the pricing front and just the cost pressure front, what I would say is we have a host of tools at our disposal. So we think about the suite of offerings we want to always start with productivity and drive productivity as hard as we possibly can. And then we are going to look to revenue growth management and the tools that we have in revenue growth management, whether they be price package architecture, whether they be pricing, which would include list pricing. All of those are at our disposal. But at the end of the day, we have to earn that price in the marketplace, through investing in our brands, through innovating through putting the types of performances that we have been able to put against our brands, which puts us in a good position to have the confidence to slightly raise our guidance even despite increased cost pressures that are quite real. Amit, do you want to? Yes. So we definitely did benefit somewhat from shipment timing. And if you think about - back to quarter one 2020 where U.S. consumption growth exceeded shipments fairly markedly because of the surge. You almost have the mere reflection in quarter one 2021 where the reverse was true, where U.S. net sales growth exceeded consumption. And as we have said many times in the past, consumption is a good guide. It evens out over time. And some of this was clearly borrowed from or taken from quarter four, which we talked about when we did our quarter four call. But that is essentially where the net of Amit, you want to? Yes. No, thanks, Jason. I would say, obviously, we can't comment on forward-looking pricing and promotions and so forth. But what we are seeing, what we would expect is a gradual return to normal levels of merchandising activity. As more and more people start to emerge from the pandemic, as capacity for ourselves and others starts to become more normalized. I would just expect that you'll see a more normal return to levels; I wouldn't see anything really above that. I wouldn't see the macro conditions that would drive that. And so yes, I think we can hold serve. And we are off to a good start. It is clear the areas where we want to work on, where we need to work on. And it is clear where we have really good momentum, and we want to continue to push against that as well. Yes. Thanks, Michael. So obviously, I'm not going to comment on any specific customers, but we have a mantra here that we talk about all the time, we have to earn the pricing that we get in the marketplace. Clearly, there is an inflationary environment that is real. Clearly that is across broad swaths of the economy. And clearly, there is been a lot of reporting on that. But we approach it with the humility that says we have got to invest in our brands. We have got to bring innovation. We have got to do everything that we can to continue to earn our place in the marketplace. But I would also say, we did raise guidance, and we are talking about holding as close to possible to our gross margins. So that reflects the type of confidence that we have that we will be able to get through this by managing our price, mix, innovation with our customers. Well, we have said in the past, we like the brand building that we have got in place. We like the levels that we have in place. In the back half of last year, we were very purposeful in saying what we pulled from the second quarter we are putting in the back half of the year because brands need investments. And we kept to our overall budget from last year, although it was back-half weighted, and that clearly gave us momentum as we entered 2021, whether it be the Pringles example in the U.S. and in Europe. But we like our levels of brand building spending. We think they are important. They clearly give us the opportunity to drive our brands. And as I said, earn what we get in the marketplace. And so I think we are well balanced. I think we are confident. Again, we raised our guidance based on that. And it is still very early in the year, so there is a lot of uncertainty at play. But we like the way it is shaped up. We like the way it started, and we like our plan going forward from a brand-building perspective and a profit delivery perspective. Yes. Thanks, Chris. I will start, and Amit can build as well. We did raise guidance, and I think I heard your question, why not more, but we are being prudent. Obviously, we are still in a pandemic, where others are really not even giving guidance beyond the next quarter. We are trying to be as helpful and as transparent as possible. We still have COVID. Obviously, we have lots of challenges in emerging markets based on COVID and other things, but we are off to a good start. And we are confident, and we feel like we can manage all the things that you mentioned, the inflationary environment, the potential disruptions, but we want to be prudent, and we want to be able to deliver what we say we are going to deliver. Yes. Thanks, Bryan. So I would say we are really where we want to be, right. We are always constructively discontent. We want to do better. We demand of ourselves to do better. But when you think about things like shaping a growth portfolio, that came through and it delivered. The divestiture is behind us. It was a smart thing to do. It was the right thing to do. But you see our emerging markets, you see our snacks brands, you see our many of our portfolio brands really executing well for us. When we think about perfect service and perfect store, built perfectly for the type of pressure that we had to face last year and ongoing and facing this year. We talk about building world-class brands. And we put some investment surges into our brands unapologetically in the past. And because of those things, before the pandemic, I would remind you that we exited the year before the pandemic with 2.7% organic sales growth, right? And we were getting to balance. And then the surge happened and COVID happened. And here we are, we have had this unbelievable sampling opportunity, this reappraisal opportunity, which we have aimed to make the most of but when you look at the two-year stacks and you look at our portfolio and you look at our performance, we are delivering top line growth. We are back to growth reliably and for a lot of quarters now. And we are delivering balanced growth as well. And it is through the strength of our brands and the strength of the execution of our strategy. So we remain eager to do better. We remain hungry, but I think there is no question that deploy for growth has delivered, and we are back to a balanced growth performance. Yes. Thanks, Andrew. So I would say most of what we talked about is internal capacity, right? Many times, we look to external capacity when we are starting out. So if you look at like a Cheez-It Snap'd line, we might start with the first-line being external, but I got lots of conviction that second-line was internal. And so when we talk about cereal capacity, when we talk about Eggo capacity, we are talking about internal capacity building and expansion. So you can take from that, that there is real conviction. But what I would say is we are not building based on any kind of pandemic that is going to go away. We are building on what we really need, right? And so like others, we operate our capacity pretty tightly, right? And historically, when you are in categories that are growing low single digits, you would expect that, the surge created a whole different set of circumstances but as I said, 2020 is not really going to be our high watermark, right? And so we are going to lap those things in 2021. And we are going to need the capacity to do that in things like certain elements of our ready-to-eat cereal in Eggo, in some of our Cheez-It lines, but we are in pretty good shape. And so it is all embedded in our guidance, and we feel like we have got a good plan. Not really, Rob. A couple of years ago, when we were doing a lot of on the go. We were attacking the on-the-go occasions, and we did a lot of third party, but we also had a lot of manual work being done, that was the case. But now we are more in a normalized environment where we are building capacity based on increasing demand. So not really."

            "content": "Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Slide 10 offers an at-a-glance summary of our financial results for the first quarter. As you can see, they are quite strong. Particularly when considering the year ago growth they were lapping. Specifically, last year is first quarter featured 8% organic growth on net sales and operating profit that grew roughly 8% excluding the impact of the prior year is divestiture. So we generated very good growth on growth. Net sales grew on a one year and a two-year basis. In developed markets, it was aided by shipment timing and at home demand remaining elevated, partially offset by continued softness in away-from-home channels. In emerging markets, we generated sales performance that was better than expected. Currency-neutral adjusted basis operating profit grew on a one year and a two-year basis, driven by the net sales growth and expansion in gross profit margin and good discipline on overhead, all of which more than offset a year-on-year increase in brand building. Clearly, we are seeing good operating leverage from our strong top line growth. Currency-neutral adjusted basis, earnings per share grew on a one-year and a two-year basis despite a higher effective tax rate. And in what is typically our lightest quarter for cash flow, it was stronger than I anticipated for the quarter. Of course, it is down from last year is unusually high first quarter cash flow but as you can see, it is ahead of the pre pandemic 2019 level. Let's look at these metrics in a little more detail. Slide 11 breaks quarter one net sales growth into its components. Volume declined against last year is math surge, but it was up on a two-year basis. At home demand remained elevated. Emerging markets sustained momentum and we did see favorable timing of shipments in the U.S. as expected. Price/mix was again positive, which is important given the accelerated cost inflation we are seeing. During quarter one, we saw positive pricing in all four regions, reflecting revenue growth management initiatives, and we also saw an overall mix shift back towards snacks. Currency translation was a slight positive in the quarter. As we look to the remainder of 2021, we still expect to see a moderating top line. We faced our toughest volume comparison in quarter two, and we are assuming continued deceleration in at home demand. Slide 12 offers some perspective on our profit margins which held up very well in spite of higher costs. Our gross profit margin in quarter one improved on a one-year and a two-year basis as productivity and price realization were effective at covering accelerated input cost inflation as well as incremental COVID costs against only a partial quarter of those costs in the year-earlier quarter. We also more than offset a mix shift towards emerging markets and particularly towards our distributor business in West Africa. The flow-through of this higher gross profit margin led to an increase in operating profit margin as well as decreased overhead balanced out a high single-digit increase in brand building. The brand building increase reflects the phasing of our commercial plans relative to last year is modest decrease in quarter one at the onset of the pandemic. Even with this year-on-year increase in brand building, we still grew operating profit at a double-digit rate this quarter. As we look to the rest of the year, we obviously faced our toughest gross profit margin comparison in quarter two due to last year is outsized operating leverage that produce, by far the highest gross profit margin over the past couple of years, as you can see on the slide. In the second half, we are working to hold our margin as close as possible to year ago levels. In spite of our mix shift towards emerging markets and accelerated cost inflation. Further down the P&L, we faced our toughest comparison on brand building in quarter two as well. Because last year is quarter two was when we delayed significant brand investment to the second half. That second half investment helped create the momentum we are seeing today. But we return to more typical levels of brand investment in this year is second half. Turning to the remainder of the income statement and Slide 13, we see that our below the line items were relatively neutral to earnings per share in quarter one. As expected, interest expense decreased year-on-year on lower debt and this will continue for the remainder of the year, with quarter four, additionally lapping the nonrecurring $20 million debt redemption expense we recorded last year. Other income was lower year-on-year and modestly lower than what should be its quarterly run rate for the rest of the year. Our effective tax rate of 22.7% was higher than last year is relatively low level and should still turn out to be around 22.5% for the full-year. Average shares outstanding were flattish year-on-year, with the impact of quarter one's accelerated buybacks to be more pronounced in the coming quarters, resulting in a full-year average shares outstanding that is a little more than 0.5% lower than 2020. Turning to our cash flow on Slide 14. We had a strong start to the year and maintained good financial flexibility. As expected, our cash flow in quarter one was lower than quarter one 2020's unusually high level, not because of net earnings or working capital both of which were favorable year-on-year, but because of year-on-year swings in accruals and other balance sheet items as well as lapping last year is delayed capital expenditure. However, as you can see on the chart, quarter one 2021's cash flow was well above that of quarter one 2019 in what is always our lightest cash flow quarter of the year. Net debt is lower year-on-year, even despite our resumption of share buybacks, and we like the state of our balance sheet. As we look to the rest of the year, cash flow will likely remain below last year is COVID-aided levels but still well above 2019 levels. And between our share buybacks, which we were able to accelerate into the first quarter and an increased dividend, we are meaningfully increasing the cash returned to shareowners. I will conclude with a discussion about full-year guidance shown on Slide 15. As Steve mentioned, our strong quarter one performance gives us the confidence to raise our guidance this early in the year. Specifically, our guidance for full-year organic net sales growth moves up to approximately flat year-on-year from our previous guidance of about negative 1%. This would equate to closer to 3% growth on our two-year compound annual growth rate, effectively eliminating the noise of lapping last year is COVID-related surge. Our guidance for currency-neutral adjusted basis operating profit improves a decline of about 1% to 2% year-on-year versus our previous guidance of minus 2%. This equates to closer to 4% growth on a two-year CAGR basis, excluding our divested businesses from the 2019 base. Our guidance for currency-neutral adjusted basis earnings per share increases to growth of about 1% to 2% year-on-year versus our previous guidance of up 1%. And this equates to something around 5% growth on a two-year CAGR basis, excluding our thins divested businesses from the 2019 base. And our guidance for cash flow moves up to a range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion versus our previous guidance of approximately $1.1 billion. We think this guidance is prudent, given that it is early in the year and given a business environment that is somewhat uncertain in terms of pandemic impacts and cost inflation. Obviously, we are pleased with our start to the year. We are in strong financial condition. Our brands and regions are performing well. And we are solidly on track for continued balanced financial delivery on a two-year basis. And with that, let me turn it back to Steve for a review of our major businesses. Yes. I think it reflects the strength of our portfolio, and you are seeing that come through I think from a pure guidance standpoint, we are expecting that elevated demand will moderate a little bit from quarter one. So I think that is what's built into the guidance. We are expecting growth in emerging markets to sustain, maybe not at the double-digit rates that we saw in quarter one. But certainly, we continue to expect growth in the emerging markets. Yes. I think cost for inflation, no question, it is accelerated. I think we are now looking at it being in the high end of the mid- single-digit rate for 2021. We are seeing it across our cost basket from exchange-traded commodities to diesel and energy, ocean freight; we have seen a spike in ocean freight as well. I think all of that has been incorporated into the guidance that we provided today. From a hedging perspective, we are about 76% hedged on the exchange-traded commodities. Obviously, there are other cost pressures outside those as well. But I think we have reflected that in our guidance. And you would have seen that in our quarter one results, we had strong pricing and mix come through. And as Steve mentioned, it is across the whole range of levers, including productivity, including list price increases, including trade optimization and price pack architecture. So the whole suite of revenue growth management tools. I think similar levels. Though, obviously, it is accelerating through the year. And then obviously, in quarter one, we were in more hedged than in the later part of the year, as you would expect. Yes. So I think our goal is still to expand our gross profit margin on a two-year basis. So I think that is still our goal. And in that context, from a 2021 standpoint, obviously, we were ahead in quarter one. Quarter two is going to be our biggest lap as we lapped last year is outsized operating leverage. And then for the balance of 2021, our goal would be to be as close to flat as possible. So that is kind of the way we are thinking about gross profit margin. Too early to talk about 2022 right now. But certainly, as Steve mentioned, from a revenue growth management standpoint, we are looking at a whole range of tools to offset the inflation that we see. Yes. I think just to build on what Steve said, Jason, in addition to last year is factors and timing versus last year, as we had mentioned in our last call, some of this came from quarter four. Most of it, I would say, the timing came from quarter four. There is been a little bit as it relates to quarter two. So there was some shipment ahead of activities, but most of it came from quarter four. And just to build on that, maybe a couple of additional points. Just on the shape of the year. So I think quarter two is when we have got the biggest lap, right. So if you look at it from a gross margin standpoint, that was the quarter where we saw the operational - the outsized operational leverage come through. So we are going to lap that in quarter two. Our quarter two was also when we delayed our brand-building into the rest of the year. And just if you recall, quarter two operating profit last year, in 2020, was up 24%. So I think that will just give you a sense of the lap ahead of us and just the shape of the year. I think, like I said, from a gross margin standpoint, in the second half, we target to get as close to flat as possible, recognizing that inflation continues to rise and recognizing that we are probably about 76% hedged. And the SG&A comp should moderate in the second half. Yes. I think from a sourcing standpoint, we feel very confident in terms of our diverse supplier base. So while, obviously, with ocean freight and containers and the Suez crisis, there is been pressure in the system. But I think from a supply and a security of supply standpoint, we are confident about that. I think the only thing I would add is that we delivered balanced delivery last year. Our goal is to grow our gross margin on a two-year basis. And our cash flow convergence. Last year was an exceptional year. But even if you set that aside, our goal is to increase our cash flow conversion. And our new guidance on cash flow would indicate around 75% to 80% conversion. Yes. I think most of the price mix came from pricing in the quarter. And like I mentioned, that was the whole range of tools across all the regions. I think in some of our EMs, we took significant pricing to cover for commodity. And remember, in some of these markets, we have also had transactional ForEx impacts through the back half of 2020 into 2021. So you have seen pricing to offset that come through in the pricing. I think we also benefited from mix. With snacks growth coming back certainly from a mix standpoint, that is a positive. So that is kind of what drove the quarter one results. Yes. We don't get into the by category profitability, but I would say that, yes, I mean, it is kind of at the mix level, at the margin level, it kind of is neutral-ish at the price level, it is accretive. No, I think just looking at the cost situation, commodities, ForEx, and obviously, we have seen inflation in both. So I think trying to preserve your margins while also balancing out volume growth and share, I think, and triangulating between those drivers."

After the speaker\u2019s remarks there will be a question-and-answer session with publishing analysts. At this time I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for Kellogg Company. Mr. Renwick, you may begin your conference call. \nJohn Renwick: Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for a review of our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results as well as our outlook for 2023. I'm joined this morning by Steve Cahillane, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Amit Banati, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. Slide Number 3 shows our forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware, certain statements made today such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance, are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the third slide of this presentation, as well as to our public SEC filings. This is a particular note amidst the current operating environment, which includes unusually high input cost inflation, global supply disruptions, and other uncertain global macroeconomic conditions, all of whose direction, length, and severity are so difficult to predict. A recording of today's webcast and supporting documents will be archived for at least 90 days on the Investor page of kelloggcompany.com. As always, when referring to our results and outlook, unless otherwise noted, we will be referring to them on an organic basis for net sales and on a currency-neutral adjusted basis for operating profit and earnings per share. And now, I'll turn it over to Steve.\nSteven Cahillane: Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. The fourth quarter completed what was an excellent year, competitively, financially, and in terms of the grit and skill, our organization demonstrated in executing through what were truly extraordinary circumstances. The strength of our snacks portfolio was clearly evident with double-digit net sales growth across all regions underpinned by strong end market performance. We sustained exceptional growth in emerging markets led by our noodles and other portfolio in Africa, but also posting strong growth in snacks and cereal across EMEA and Latin America.  We mitigated the profit impact of unusually high input costs that accelerated during the year, leaning into productivity and carefully executed revenue growth management actions. We navigated through economy wide supply bottlenecks and shortages and worked to restore capacity in much of our business, most notably in North America Cereal and North America Frozen Foods. The result of all of this was strong financial delivery that exceeded expectations throughout the year prompting us to raise guidance more than once this year for net sales, operating profit and EPS and still over deliver that guidance thanks to a strong fourth quarter. We also announced, planned, and made significant progress towards a separation of our company that will not only improve performance of North America Cereal Co., but provide clearer visibility into the strength of the snacks oriented parent company.  With all of this going on and amidst global supply disruptions and high costs, we kept our focus on sustaining momentum in all of our businesses. We stay true to our deploy for growth strategy, leveraging our growth shaped portfolio, orienting our brand building and innovation towards winning occasions and sustaining momentum in our biggest world class brands, all while working to restore service levels and leveraging all levers of revenue growth management in an attempt to keep up with soaring cost inflation. The results of this focus on sustaining momentum are shown clearly in our organic net sales growth which is shown on Slide Number 6. Not only did our sales come in ahead of expectations every quarter, but our growth accelerated sequentially every quarter and this growth was impressively broad based in all four of our regions and in all four of our major category groups, snacks, cereal, frozen and noodles and other. We also remain committed to our better day\u2019s strategy towards environmental, social, and governance practices. Slide Number 7 show some examples of tangible actions taken and recognitions received during the fourth quarter alone, illustrating this continued commitment. And you can expect us to maintain this focus on execution and reliable financial delivery in 2023.  Slide Number 8 shows that you can expect many of the same drivers of this financial delivery as we saw in 2022. Our snacks business, which is roughly half of today's Kellogg Company should see sustained momentum led by truly world class brands. In our strong emerging markets businesses, we expect to continue to drive growth and manage through what are always interesting macroeconomic conditions. Input cost inflation remains high, which means we will again be focused on realizing productivity and cost savings supplemented by utilizing all levers of our database revenue growth management disciplines around the world. And we continue to progress on our supply recovery in specific businesses. As a result, we are forecasting growth in net sales and operating profit that are above our long-term targets even as we continue to invest in the enhancement of capabilities, service levels, and the strength of our brands.  Meanwhile, we continue to March towards the separation into more focused companies, starting with the spinoff of North American Cereal Company still scheduled for late this year. Work has progressed on the carving out of financials, the designing of new organizations, and the separation of key systems and processes. Separately, you'll recall that we were exploring strategic options for the plant based food business which represents about 2% of our company's net sales. Given current market conditions as well as our confidence in this business as a long-term growth vehicle, we have decided to retain it as part of global snacking company. We remain as confident as ever in the value to be created by making global snacking company and North American Cereal Company more focused with better visibility into and valuation of their performance and outlook. In short, we are poised for another good year of results.  Before discussing our businesses in detail, let me now turn it over to Amit for a review of our financials.\nAmit Banati: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide Number 10 provides a summary of our 2022 financial results. A better than expected performance in quarter four drove us to hit or exceed our guidance for the full year. Our net sales led the way accelerating to 16% organic growth in the fourth quarter and resulting in 12% organic growth for the year, which was higher than expected. This top line growth more than offset a sizable year-on-year increase in investment resulting in our adjusted basis operating profit growing 20% on a currency neutral basis in quarter four. This brought our full year growth to 7%, also exceeding expectations.  Our adjusted basis earnings per share increased 17% on a currency neutral basis in quarter four despite being weighed down by the as anticipated increase in interest expense and reduction in pension income related to the decline in financial markets. This quarter four performance resulted in full year EPS growth of 5% on a currency neutral adjusted basis, ahead of our expectations. Cash flow came in at about $1.2 billion and increased from the prior year and in line with our expectations. Excluded from our currency neutral results of course is foreign currency translation, which reduced our net sales, operating profit, and earnings per share by about four percentage points in quarter four and about the same for the full year EPS.  Now let's look at each metric in a little more detail. Slide Number 11 plays out the components of our strong net sales growth. Our double-digit organic growth and net sales in 2022 was driven by price mix which accelerated in the second half as we continued to execute revenue growth management actions around the world to cover accelerated input cost inflation. Volume grew slightly in the quarter due to continued recovery in North America Cereal and declined only modestly for the full year, reflecting both price elasticity that has not moved up as much or as soon as we had expected, as well as our replenishment of trade inventories during the year as our supply improved. Foreign currency translation was a headwind all year, with particularly adverse impacts in quarter three and quarter four.  Let\u2019s discuss gross profit on Slide Number 12. Supply disruptions created incremental costs and inefficiencies throughout the year and input cost inflation accelerated across the year. Yet because of productivity efforts and effective revenue growth management actions around the world, we were able to largely offset the dollar impact of those higher input costs and we grew our overall gross profit dollars this year. In fact, our gross profit dollars came in higher than expected both in quarter four and the full year. From a percentage margin perspective, though, there is a mechanical impact of matching input cost inflation which price realization. And because we could not cover the unpredictable inefficiencies from economy wide bottlenecks and shortages. We did see year-on-year increase in gross profit margin in quarter four as we lapped the first of two quarters impacted by the fire and strike and we finished the full year in line with expectations we had communicated. In 2023 we expect to continue to grow gross profit dollars while our margin stabilizes and improves slightly during the year. Some of this is related to the fire and strike impact being one time in nature largely isolated to quarter four 2021 and quarter one 2022. And some of it will come from bottlenecks and shortages gradually diminishing. But this improved margin performance will also be driven by price realization catching up to input cost inflation that is expected to moderate in the back half of the year. Moving down the income statement on Slide Number 13, we see how our SG&A accelerated its year-on-year increase across the year just as we said it would. After having been curved during severe supply disruptions including the fire and strike in North America our advertising and promotion investment was ramped back in the second half and finished the year roughly flat with 2021. Overhead meanwhile increased year-on-year in all four quarters as we gradually returned to travel and meetings and as we accrued higher incentive compensation related to our above budget financial performance. In 2023 the quarterly phasing of SG&A expense will be affected by lapping last year\u2019s North America\u2019s Cereal pull back on brand building in the first half and rapid ramp up in the second half.  Slide Number 14 shows our continued upward trajectory on operating profit. Operating profit in the fourth quarter was up 16% year-on-year including a negative currency translation impact of almost 4 percentage points. While it was lapping a year earlier decline due to last year\u2019s fire and strike, this year\u2019s quarter four profits was above that of two years ago. Importantly it featured exceptional topline growth and a significant year-on-year increase in investment. For the full year our operating profit increased by 4% after a negative 3% impact for currency translation. As you can see on the slide, this operating profit was not only higher than 2021, it was also higher than two and three years ago.  Slide Number 15 shows are below the line items which were again collectively negative to EPS growth in the quarter and therefore the full year. Driven by non-operating factors, they will be an even larger headwind in 2023. Interest expense was up sharply year-on-year in quarter four as rising interest rates affected the roughly one fifth of our debt that is floating. The quarterly run rate for 2023 interest expense will likely be a bit higher than this quarter four level. Other income decreased in quarter four and the full year. Most of this was related to the media remeasurement of certain U.S. benefit plans, though in quarter four it was partially offset by better than expected FOREX gains and interest income that we do not expect to repeat. As we have discussed previously, the decline in benefit plan income is related to 2022's fall in financial markets, which reduced the value of planned assets and raised interest rates. We remeasured about half of our planned exposure in the second-half of 2022 and 2023 will feel the impact of remeasuring all of our plans. Hence, we could see a year-on-year decline in other income in 2023 that is almost twice the decrease we recorded in 2022. Our effective tax rate came in a little higher than expected in quarter four and therefore the full year, mostly reflecting geography mix. For 2023, we expect the tax rate to be approximately 22%. Our JV earnings and minority interests were collectively flattish year-on-year in quarter four, finishing the year higher than last year, led by good performance by our joint ventures. Collectively, these are expected to be relatively flat in 2023. And average shares outstanding were flattish in 2022 as increased options exercises by employees over the course of the year offset the benefit of share buyback executed early in the year.  Our cash flow and balance sheet also remained in very good shape as shown on Slide Number 16. Our cash flow increased year-on-year despite year-on-year swings in sales and receivables in December as we lapped last year\u2019s fire and strike. This increase in cash flow over the past few years has helped us to reduce our debt right through 2022, leading to lower leverage ratios. This has given us enhanced financial flexibility even as we have continued to increase cash return to shareowners in the form of an increased dividend and buybacks this year. Let's now pivot to 2023, starting with Slide Number 17 and some key assumptions behind our guidance. First and most importantly, we expect to sustain a strong business momentum. Between price realization, the momentum of our categories, and the strength of our brand plans we are confident we can achieve another year of above algorithm net sales growth. And while input costs inflation remains high, it should decelerate year-on-year in the second half, and the same can be said for bottlenecks and shortages. Therefore, we expect to generate above algorithm growth for operating profit as well in 2023. Next, our guidance reflects the impact of headwinds on our non-operating below the line items. Interest expense will increase substantially because of the rise in interest rates worldwide. And non-cash pension income will drop sharply owing to lower asset values entering the year and to a higher interest charge reflecting the rise in interest rates. The pending spinoff of North America Cereal Co, is still targeted to be executed towards the end of the year. For simplicity reasons only our guidance assumes it remains in our results for the full year. Slide Number 18 shows our guidance by key metric. Organic growth in net sales is forecast to be in the 5% to 7% range, another strong year. Given the cost environment this growth will be weighted towards price mix, reflecting revenue growth actions from both 2022 and this year. Importantly, this net sales growth is expected to be broad based across our portfolio and led by momentum in snacks and in emerging markets. On an adjusted basis and excluding currency, we expect operating profit to grow in the 7% to 9% range. This above target growth will be driven by the strong net sales, which drives the growth in gross profit dollars that fuel increased brand building. At the earnings per share level, the strong operating profit growth will be more than offset by the pension and interest headwinds we discussed earlier. The impact of the accounting re-measurement of pension and post retirement alone is negative 7 percentage points to EPS growth. Again, it should be emphasized that this is a noncash, non-operating item, and it was driven by what was a rare steep decline in the financial markets in 2022. Without that item, our EPS would be up 3% to 5%, even despite the higher interest expense and tax rate. Cash flow is expected to come in somewhere between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. Our underlying base business cash flow will continue to grow year-on-year, reaching $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, but there will be roughly $300 million plus of cash outlays related to the pending spin-off. This is a combination of cash costs and capital expenditure, all onetime in nature and all related to executing the transaction and setting up the stand-alone business. So to summarize on Slide Number 19, we continue to feel very good about how we are performing and about our financial condition. Across our regions and category groups, we sustained solid momentum in 2022, and we expect that momentum to continue in 2023. Amidst high cost inflation across inputs and energy, we were able to protect profit dollars through productivity and revenue growth management in 2022, and we will do so again in 2023. In an environment of disruptions up and down the supply chain, we have executed well and steadily improved service levels in 2022 and will continue to do so in 2023. In 2022, we delivered above-target growth in currency-neutral, net sales and operating profit, and we plan on doing that again in 2023. We have increased our cash flow and further deleveraged our balance sheet, giving us excellent financial flexibility going into 2023. And we remain as confident as ever in the value that can be created by spinning off North America Cereal Co. Not only will that business thrive amidst increased focus, but the strength of the remaining global snacking co. will be significantly more visible. So we are looking forward to another good year in 2023. And with that, I'll turn it back to Steve to discuss our individual businesses.\nSteven Cahillane: Thanks, Amit. Let's start with Kellogg North America on Slide Number 21. As you can see, our largest region performed very well in 2022, straight through the fourth quarter. We started the year with a lingering inventory impact and costs arising from the second half 2021 fire and strike as well as other supply disruptions. And quarter-by-quarter, we executed well, both from a supply chain perspective and a commercial perspective, finishing the year with very strong net sales and operating profit growth.  Within North America, our largest segment is snacks, representing over half of our sales in the region. And this segment led the way in 2022, as shown on Slide Number 22. There was some timing of shipments, particularly year-over-year within the quarters, but North America Snacks finished the year in double-digit growth. In fact, North America Snacks has accelerated its organic net sales growth in each of the past four years. Leading the way were world-class brands like Pringles and Cheez-It, both of which generated double-digit consumption growth in 2022, and Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Treats, both of which sustained their multiyear momentum as well. Our North America Cereal business, as depicted on Slide Number 23. This business overcame enormous obstacles on its way to delivering very strong net sales growth. We entered the year depleted on finished goods inventories. As we rebuild those inventories, SKU by SKU, we were able to replenish retailer shelves more quickly than we anticipated. And during the second half, we were able to ramp up our commercial programs, and we've entered the new year with real momentum. Slide Number 24 shows the end market progress we have made since restoring inventories and commercial activity. As you can see, our performance has continued to improve sequentially, accelerating both our consumption growth and our share recovery. This business is back on track and is poised to sustain growth in 2023 when we will have a full year of commercial activity. In addition, with supply back in place, this business has begun to restore its profit margins. North America Frozen Foods is shown on Slide Number 25. This was another business that ran into capacity and supply challenges in 2022. For Eggo, it was simply a matter of strong demand over the last couple of years, putting us up against capacity. We put in capacity in midyear and since that time, Eggo's consumption growth has accelerated. And for Morningstar Farms, we experienced significant production issues at a co-manufacturer. During the fourth quarter, supply came back online and almost immediately, we saw signs of improvement in market. So moving to Slide Number 26, Kellogg North America has all the pieces in place for another good year in 2023. Our snacks brands are demonstrating undeniable momentum, and they represent more than half of our North America regions net sales. Our cereal business continues to outpace what has been very strong category sales growth as we continue to ramp up commercial activity. And our frozen businesses are getting past some severe supply constraints. Meanwhile, our productivity and revenue growth management actions are catching up to what has been steadily rising input cost inflation just as we are starting to see signs of bottlenecks and shortages receding. The result should be margin improvement for North America this year. And of course, North America will be moving full speed ahead with the carving out and spinning off of North America Cereal Company. We're making good progress with detailed implementation plans, all while remaining focused on delivering good financial results and executing in the marketplace. Now let's turn to Europe and Slide Number 27. Cost inflation accelerated faster in this region than others, particularly when energy prices and other costs soared after the outbreak of war in Ukraine. Our revenue growth management actions have yet to catch up to the accelerated cost pressures, pulling down profit in the last couple of quarters and will likely remain a pressure on profits into the first half of 2023. The fourth quarter also featured a meaningful year-on-year increase in brand investment. Nevertheless, Kellogg Europe had another good year, posting its fifth straight year of growth in both organic net sales and operating profit. Leading the way were snacks, which now represent more than half of our Europe region's net sales, as shown on Slide Number 28. And aside from the Russia impact and year-ago comparisons in quarter three, this segment drove strong double-digit net sales growth all year. This momentum is not new. This was our fifth straight year of organic net sales growth for Europe snacks. End market, Pringles generated strong consumption growth across key markets in the quarter and the full year. And in the UK, we also delivered rapid growth for Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Squares. Turning to our European cereal business and Slide Number 29, you can see that this business continues to deliver steady growth. On the strength of commercial activities and revenue growth management needed to cover rising costs, this business showed sequential acceleration in its organic net sales growth in each quarter. End market, category growth rates in markets across the region picked up in the fourth quarter, and we have been particularly pleased with accelerated growth and share gains for brands like Rice Krispies in the UK, Tresor in France, and Special K in several markets. So you can see that Kellogg Europe remains in very good condition as we head into 2023. As indicated on Slide Number 30, we expect to sustain momentum in snacks led by Pringles, but also increasingly accompanied by portable wholesome snacks like Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Squares. In cereal, we have strong brand plans, including renovation and innovation and a campaign celebrating our 25th year of our Better Days social program in the UK. We will continue to manage through cost and supply pressures, which are particularly heavy in the first half. And we have an agreement to divest our Russia business, though the deal's timing, approvals and final details are still pending. This business represents a little more than 5% of Kellogg Europe's total sales. So the impact of this divestiture should not be meaningful to adjusted basis results. Now let's turn to Latin America on Slide Number 31. As the chart shows, Kellogg Latin America grew net sales and operating profit strongly, both in the fourth quarter and full year. In fact, this region posted strong and accelerating organic net sales growth all year attributed to its brands, its commercial execution, and its expansion of route-to-market capabilities as well as its revenue growth management actions and its agility in managing through supply challenges.  Our snacks business in Latin America is shown on Slide Number 32. This business has grown consistently over the years. In 2022, it led the organic net sales growth for the region with year-on-year growth of more than 20% in both the fourth quarter and the full year. The growth was broad-based, finishing the year with the fourth quarter that featured strong double-digit net sales gains across all of our sub regions, Mexico, Brazil, Pacific and the Caribbean and Central America region. The strong growth in the quarter and year was driven by price/mix needed to cover soaring cost inflation and adverse transactional currency impact. And while volume did decline, the elasticity was below historical levels. End market data shows sustained double-digit category growth in the quarter and the full year for our major salty snacks markets, with Pringles gaining share in both of its biggest Latin America markets, which are Mexico and Brazil. Our cereal business in Latin America also grew net sales organically in the fourth quarter and full year, as indicated on Slide Number 33. Early in the year, this business felt the impact of supply disruption coming out of North America's fire and strike, particularly in our Caribbean business. But as you can see, once that was behind us, our cereal net sales reaccelerated strongly. In market, our consumption growth was robust across the region in the quarter and the full year, led by key brands like Frosted Flakes in Mexico and Brazil, Corn Flakes in Brazil and Puerto Rico, and Froot Loops in Colombia. So moving on to Slide Number 34, Latin America, too, is poised for another good year in 2023. We expect to sustain momentum in snacks, led by Pringles, and we expect to continue to grow in cereal. We expect to improve profit margins this year, and work is well under towards carving out our Caribbean cereal business into the North American Cereal Company spin-off. We'll finish up our regional review with EMEA, shown on Slide Number 35. This region continues to deliver exceptional top line and bottom line growth. Net sales grew organically in the high teens or better all year long. In the fourth quarter, as for the full year, this growth was broad-based with growth across all of our sub regions, Africa, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and the Middle East and North Africa. The growth was also strong across all of our category groups: cereal, snacks and noodles and other. Despite enormous cost pressures, the region also delivered double-digit profit growth on a currency-neutral adjusted basis both in the fourth quarter and the full year. Snacks in EMEA posted outstanding organic net sales growth all year, as shown on Slide Number 36. This growth was led by emerging markets ranging from Asia, Africa to the Middle East. And it was led by Pringles, which sustained strong consumption and share growth across key markets, both in the quarter and for the full year. In Australia, we also realized good consumption growth in Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Treats both for the quarter and the full year. This bodes well for further international expansion of those brands. Cereal also posted strong organic net sales growth all year, as shown on Slide Number 37. As with snacks, the growth was led by price mix, with elasticity impact on volume being lower than usual. And we saw growth across all sub regions, both in the fourth quarter and the full year. Growth was most pronounced in Africa and the Middle East, but it also remained solid in Asia and Australia. Overall, for the measured markets of this region, we grew consumption and share in the fourth quarter and the full year. Our most developed market, Australia, posted strong consumption growth in the quarter and year, led by many of our biggest brands, including double-digit gains for corn pops, corn flakes and Sultana Bran.  We also sustained good consumption growth in emerging markets with particular strength in India. And then we come to the largest segment of EMEA, noodles and other, which is shown on Slide Number 38. In every quarter this year, our EMEA noodles and other business recorded organic net sales growth of well over 20%. In fact, it has delivered double-digit organic growth every year since we consolidated the distributor portion of our West African business in 2018. Turning to Slide Number 39, we expect another year of strong top and bottom line growth for EMEA in 2023. Macro conditions can be challenging in Africa, and we have an experienced management team and joint venture partner to execute through them, which should enable us to sustain momentum in noodles and other. We should continue to see growth in cereal, led by our markets in Asia and we believe there is plenty of runway for Pringles to continue its strong growth. Meanwhile, EMEA will be looking to improve its profit margins as well. So with that, allow me to briefly summarize with Slide Number 41. From our results and our outlook, it should be very clear that our Deploy for Growth strategy has us focused on the right priorities and building the right capabilities and that our portfolio has been shaped decidedly towards growth. And following our planned separation later this year, visibility into the strength and performance of this portfolio will be even clearer. In fact, the vast majority of our portfolio is enjoying very strong momentum right now, as shown on Slide Number 41, and this is expected to drive above-target growth in net sales and operating profit in 2023. I want to thank our talented and dedicated Kellogg employees for making sure that nothing, not unusual economic conditions, not declining financial markets and pension accounting, not the preparation of a historical spin-off will distract us from continuing to deliver for our stakeholders. And with that, we'll open up the line for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question for today comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Jason, your line is now open. Please go ahead. \nJason English: Hey, good morning folks. Thanks for sliding me in. Lots of questions still on the table. Amit, maybe we can start real quick with you, housekeeping. We all have restaurants out here but based on current spot rates, where do you see FX coming in, in terms of impact to top and bottom line?\nAmit Banati: Yes. I think, Jason, just looking at the current rates, we'd say probably 1% to 2% impact on EPS and OP, maybe on sales around 3%. So that's kind of the outlook if you look at where the rates are today.\nJason English: Okay. That's helpful. And then Steve, you mentioned that Europe is finishing strong and carrying good momentum in the year, but it sure doesn't look like that from a bottom line perspective. I mean the margins are kind of falling off, and falling off fast, as we exit the year. And I think you mentioned where the pressure is going to carry into next year. I missed part of it, though. I heard you say like higher marketing. Can you unpack that a little bit more for us, what's driving the substantial step down in profitability, and also touch on -- I mean we know you were probably through price negotiation periods right now, can you give us an update on where status sits on negotiating price in that market? Thank you. \nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Sure, Jason. In Europe, it's essentially, we're catching up, right? The inflation came fast and furious, and our ability to catch up to it was impacted in the third and fourth quarter. We also had, obviously, the Russia impact primarily, in the third quarter. Higher A&P continued to bolster our top line, which we're committed to doing. And so we're catching up. It's still going to be a bit of a pressure in the first half, as we mentioned, but our underlying business is very, very solid. And our ability to get price -- earned price has also been solid. It's never easy anywhere, but the European dynamics can be challenging, but we've been making our way through it. And so we have good confidence in the underlying momentum of the business. It's really just -- took a little time to catch up.\nJason English: Okay. And the status on the price negotiations?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes, we're in reasonable shape right now, Jason. We don't like to talk too much about individual negotiations with our customers. They're doing everything that they always do, which is protect the consumer. We want to protect the consumer as well, be as affordable as possible, but we need to maintain our margins. And we're having those adult conversations, and they're proceeding constructively.\nJason English: Okay, thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question for today comes from Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Howard: Hey, can you hear me. Good morning everyone. \nSteven Cahillane: Good morning. \nAlexia Howard: Great, can I ask about the volume situation in the U.S., particularly as we rolled into 2023. I'm looking at the Nielsen data that came out yesterday, and it looked as though, frankly, that a lot of companies that was a bit of a step back. So two questions; one, is there anything you're seeing from the consumer that's shifting or is it just tough compares from Omicron last year? And then secondly, as I look at the U.S. cereal business on a two-year basis, looks like the volumes are still down mid-teens. So are we -- I know that right now, it's looking good year-on-year, but what does that imply for the ongoing price elasticity in that business as we lap the fire and strike from last year? Thanks, and I will pass it on. \nSteven Cahillane: Yes, Alexia. So for us in North America in the fourth quarter, volume was up. And obviously, overall revenue was up nicely. We did have a fairly easy comparison, particularly in North American cereal because of the fire and strike. On a two-year basis, though, we -- well, first of all, the trajectory of our North American cereal business is very, very solid, and we're very, very pleased with it. On a two-year basis, NSV is also up. I'm not sure what you're looking at, but it is up. Volume is down slightly as the category is. But our NSV on a two-year basis and a one-year basis is up in cereal. And we're very confident about the plans in 2023 that we have in place. We're confident about the distribution that we've been able to gain. We're confident about our shelf sets. Our consumer promotions are, as I said, really back on track. You can see Jalen Hurts and Tony the Tiger on television right now as a matter of fact, which is lucky for us that Jalen is in the Super Bowl. So feeling very good about our North American cereal recovery on a one year and two-year basis.\nAmit Banati: And then I think just to build on that from a guidance standpoint, we have incorporated rising elasticity. So that's built into our guidance for 2023.\nAlexia Howard: Thank you very much. I will pass it on. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. Michael, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you, good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the volume piece at a little bit higher level. Contrasting the declines you've had globally throughout the year with the relatively stronger performance in North America, excluding the 1Q hit from cereal obviously, but can you just unpack a little bit of what you're seeing differently and is it stimulus and sort of savings drawdown that supported volumes in the U.S. that now maybe is rolling over, just maybe inform how you think about the differences in the U.S. consumer versus what you're seeing around the world?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. So it's different everywhere around the world. The U.S. has been strong. It's been relatively inelastic, particularly in our categories. So we've definitely benefited from that. There's no question that the U.S. balance sheet, consumer balance sheet still remains stronger than it was pre-pandemic, although continues to erode over time. The employment situation, as you know, in the U.S. is still very strong. So overall, the consumer in the U.S. is in a good place. And when you look at the categories that we play in, it remains very strong, right. So they are cutting out discretionary items, which, we all know, high-ticket items are under a lot of pressure. Our categories are doing very well.  And if you look at the emerging markets, the same could be said, the consumer is very strong, surprisingly resilient in virtually all of our emerging markets, which has been very positive for our results from a category standpoint. And then we're doing well inside those categories. Europe is where you see -- if you go back a couple of quarters ago, we did indicate that we were seeing the beginning of elasticities returning, particularly in the cereal business, and we're seeing a little bit more of that. So the European consumer, I would say, is probably under more pressure than just about anywhere else in the world. And you see that, obviously, in the discretionary categories, and you're starting to see a little bit more of a normal return to elasticities in the European consumer. Still not back to pre-pandemic levels or what we describe as normal levels, but higher than it is in the rest of the world.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. That's helpful color. And can I just squeeze in a housekeeping follow-up on the pensions, that's a big below the line item for you this year, obviously, but is there any meaningful split between cereal and the legacy, the rest of the company and just trying to understand when that happens. Does one side of the business or the other have a disproportionate impact from that?\nAmit Banati: No. I think it's not disproportionate. It's broadly in line with the size of the business.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Dickerson of Jefferies. Rob, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRobert Dickerson: Great, thanks so much. I guess just kind of first question housekeeping is, when should we expect to get a little bit more information on the spend? And then the second question simplistically is just around cash and CAPEX side. I don't know if I heard it. But in terms of the $300 million from the upfront charges and CAPEX of the spin, just provide a little clarity as to kind of where -- what's driving that?\nAmit Banati: Yes. So I think we are on track to execute the spend towards the end of the year. So leading up to that, we'll be providing all the information as well as having the Investor Day as you'd expect. So towards the end of the year is what we're working towards. I think the $300 million, it's a combination of onetime costs related to executing the transaction. So consultants, I think we're working very closely with some blue-chip advisers on program management, ensuring that we have a comprehensive program to manage the change and develop a comprehensive plan of action. I think it includes your typical banker loyal fees as well, as well as some capital expenditure to realign the supply chain to get IT systems up and running for the new cereal company.\nRobert Dickerson: Okay, I will follow-up. Thanks so much. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Goldman of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nKenneth Goldman: Hi, I just wanted to ask about your guidance for a -- I think the word was stabilizing gross margin this year. Just curious, does stabilizing mean down versus 2022 but at a maybe decelerating rate of decline? And I'm just curious, rather, what it implies for SG&A either as a percentage of sales or on a dollar basis. It would seem to imply that both would have to come down a little bit but just curious what your thoughts were on there?\nAmit Banati: I think on a full year basis, it will be flat to slightly up on gross margins, and I think it'll improve progressively as we go through the year. So I think that's kind of the range where we are on gross margin. And then I think from -- and I think just the puts and goals in gross margin, obviously, from a positive, we've been lapping the fire and the strike. We do expect bottlenecks and shortages to moderate as we go through the year. We are starting to see that in -- as well. So that, I think, would be a positive tailwind from a gross margin standpoint.  I think from an input cost standpoint, we expect mid-teens inflation, and that's what our guidance incorporates. So it's still elevated. It's moderated from what we saw in 2022, but still elevated. And I think we continue to see input cost inflation in oils, in corn, in wheat, rice, potatoes. So that's been built in. And I think from a phasing standpoint, we'd expect gradual improvement in the year-on-year change of gross profit margin as the year progresses.  And then I think to your question on SG&A -- now I think on your question on SG&A, I think we'd expect an increase in overheads broadly in line with inflation, I think as normal activity continues to restore. And then from a brand building standpoint, we'd expect an increase as we -- as supply is restored full year of brand building through the year.\nKenneth Goldman: Great, thank you so much. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar from Barclays. Andrew, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Lazar: Great, thanks so much. Steve, there's a concern, I think, among investors for the group as a whole, right, that supply constraints ease and the benefit from pricing wanes, food companies will somehow choose to sort of ramp promotional spending to maybe more irrational levels to drive volume. And I guess this concern seems particularly acute, I think, in really cereal space, partly because Kellogg is obviously heading towards a split of the business. And I'm just curious how you'd kind of respond to that concern and get a sense for what your plans are in terms of in-market sort of activity as you go through the year? Thanks so much. \nSteven Cahillane: Yes, Andrew, we really don't have that concern. We haven't seen anything that would point to an irrational environment on the horizon. And as our supply has improved, we've been gradually restoring merchandising activity, which is an effective complement to our brand building, always has been. And so it's not a bad thing. It's not a bad thing to obviously drive displays, as you well know, drive merchandising activity. And from a supply standpoint, it's not as if there's a lot of excess capacity in our categories for us, certainly, and I think even for some of our competitors. So when you look at that, when you look at the supply availability, when you look at the demand creation, which is out there, and available, I see a very rational environment on the horizon.\nAndrew Lazar: Thanks so much. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question for today comes from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Robert, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thanks. Amit, I was hoping for a little more color on the phasing for your operating profit growth by quarter. Like first quarter, for example, I think you have an easy comparison on gross profit dollars, but then you're going to increase SG&A investment. So do you think first quarter profit growth is higher than your annual average or is it not really much different?\nAmit Banati: Yes. I think certainly, from a gross margin standpoint, as I mentioned, right, we'd be lapping the fire and strike in quarter one. But I think on the brand building in particular, right, if you recall, last year in quarter one and quarter two, we had pulled back as we were emerging from the strike. So you're going to have that negative lap in quarter one and into quarter two as well. So it's kind of -- those are the puts and goals from an operating profit phasing standpoint.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. A quick follow-up, can you give a little more color on what your process was for pursuing the spin-off of Morningstar, did you also seek a buyer in this process, and what do you think the results will be like in 2023, can it improve off of 2022 or expect a weak year?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes, Rob, I would say definitely will improve in 2023. That is our plan. And the process was very thorough. We said from the beginning, we were going to pursue a spin but would look at other strategic alternatives. We did that. And if you recall, when we began this process, valuation for peer companies were stratospheric compared to where they are today. They've come down quite substantially. So the thesis when we started the process was to truly unlock shareholder value if we could attract the same types of multiples in the public market, we should pursue that. The environment has clearly changed. And when we look at what's on the horizon for this category, we see an imminent shakeout coming. It's happening already. And there'll be a couple of players left standing, and Morningstar Farms still has some of the highest household penetration, highest name recognition, fantastic foods, strong in the freezer space where this consumer is migrating back to, and profitable, unlike many of the peers. So as we step back and look at it, we are the best parent for Morningstar Farms. And when we shared with our people this morning that we were keeping the business, there was elation. And so there's a lot of momentum underlying in our people, in their plans, and we're optimistic for 2023. And more importantly, we're optimistic beyond that because when the shakeout continues, there'll be a few left standing. And the underlying consumer drivers around health and wellness, around environmental concerns, around moving away from animal proteins, all still remain. And Morningstar Farms has one of the cleanest labels out there. And so there's a lot going from Morningstar Farms, and we're excited to keep it.\nRobert Moskow: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Bryan, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks operator. Good morning everyone. Steve, maybe just to take a step back on the snacking business. And obviously, there's a lot of focus on getting these businesses separated. But as we look forward, like how do you -- how opportunistic or how aggressive can you be in M&A, there's a lot of opportunities for acquisitions in snacking, it's definitely proven to be a very resilient category through everything we've been through the last couple of years, so just trying to get a sense of how quickly you might be able to begin adding to the portfolio or it's not really part of what you think the strategy will be going forward?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Thanks, Bryan. I think it will be part of the strategy. Obviously, we're going to execute the spin. That's priority number one. And we'll execute the spin, and we'll have a global snacking company with a very strong balance sheet, cereal company as well. And so as we look for opportunities, we'll look for organic and inorganic opportunities. And our organic opportunities, as you can see, with Pringles remain exceptional, with Cheez-It, Rice Krispies Treats, remain exceptional. Cheez-It is only now really leaving the United States and expanding overseas in Canada, Brazil, and soon other geographies as well. So on balance, we'll look at those opportunities for continued organic growth, but where we can supplement our portfolio with additions, we'll definitely look to that because we do have great capabilities in snacking, great route-to-market, and bolt-ons or bigger will be part of our considerations going forward.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, just as we're thinking about the split going forward, how dependent -- like is there any risk that if the markets really melt down or valuations change or just what's the risk that you decide to pull it or is there -- like what conditions would create a scenario where you delay it or pull it?\nSteven Cahillane: Well, Bryan, you never say never, obviously, right. But we are very, very confident that there's no condition by which we won't execute the spin by the end of this year. It's a tax-free spin-off, a dividend to our shareholders really. And so we don't have to rely on the debt markets. We don't have to rely on IPO markets, equity markets. It's a dividend to our shareowners and nothing is without risk, but we have a very high degree of confidence, and we absolutely plan on executing this by the end of the year.\nBryan Spillane: Great, thanks. We look forward to see you guys on a CAGNY.\nSteven Cahillane: Thanks Bryan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Larson of Seaport Research Partners. Eric, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nEric Larson: Yeah, thanks for squeezing in everybody. Congratulations on a good year. So my question is really this, Europe seems to be the one area that might have a little more uncertainty for the kind of the forward look, probably a pretty difficult first half comparison, maybe better second half. Do you expect Europe to make a good positive contribution this year to the U.S. total? And are there any special onetime events that you had last year, either as a headwind or a tailwind, such as promotional events where Pringles has been very strong in things like soccer events, etcetera? Is there -- can you kind of peel back an onion a little bit for us on kind of the forward 12-month outlook for Europe?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes, Eric, thanks for the question. I'd say there's nothing unusual that we're lapping aside from an easier comp when we get to the Russian comparisons is one. And the first half is really the catch-up -- pricing catching up to costs, and we're very confident that we're going to do that. The underlying brand strength remains very strong. Europe has just completed their fifth year of growth and so it's been a long story of underlying momentum driven by great execution on Pringles. We've got a great plan for Pringles again based on a number of different activities, strong consumer engagement, strong customer engagement with Pringles. Our cereal brands remain strong. And one of the real surprises has been our portable wholesome snacks has really returned to growth and is doing quite well. And so it's a first half, second half, but it's really more in terms of catching up, which we're in process of doing. And we can see it. We can see it in our forecast that it's happening, and it gives us a great deal of confidence that there'll be a sixth year of growth in Europe. You want to add anything?\nAmit Banati: No, I think just building on the phasing comment, I think we'd be expecting to catch up on the pricing at an increasing rate through the first half. And then I think in the second half, the combination of the pricing having been caught up as well as easier comp and, hopefully, moderating inflation, I think, would lead to a higher growth, OP growth in the -- operating profit growth in the second half.\nEric Larson: One quick follow-up. Given that your pension income is really kind of a noncash event, but I think it gets priced and looked at as a cash event, have you ever considered reporting your EPS on a cash EPS basis as opposed to the way you report it now?\nAmit Banati: No, we haven't, but we'll certainly study that.\nEric Larson: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question for today comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Steve, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nStephen Powers: Hey, great. Good morning. Thanks guys. Maybe to start, just some follow-up on a couple of topics that came up earlier. Just -- the first one on the cash cost, the CAPEX associated to $300 million, is that -- is there any kind of timing element on that, does that -- has that come pretty equally throughout the year, does it build as we get closer to the actual event? And on pricing, I'm sure there's incremental pricing in 2023 in the emerging markets. It sounds like there's pricing to come in Europe. My question is, is there any kind of material magnitude of pricing anticipated in the U.S. and if so, could you give us a little sense of the magnitude there?\nSteven Cahillane: I'll start with the pricing and let Amit take the CAPEX. I'll start with what we always talk about in terms of we're not going to get into forward-looking pricing and customer negotiations and things of that nature, but we always start with the first line of defense against rising costs is productivity. And so this is -- the receding of bottlenecks and shortages have given us the opportunity to really put together more historic productivity plans because all that noise is starting to recede. And so we will have an aggressive productivity plan. But as Amit talked about, our intention is to stabilize margins to slightly grow them. So that's going to require revenue growth management throughout the year, and that'll look different throughout the year, depending on what geography it is. But that is our intention.\nAmit Banati: And I think in terms of the onetime costs and the phasing through the year, I mean, we're right in the middle of the program. And so I think you could expect it to be spent through the year. So there's nothing particular to call out in that.\nStephen Powers: Okay. Yes. Okay, great, thank you. And I guess the other question is and I appreciate that a lot more will be forthcoming on this. But just in terms of thinking about the North American Cereal Company and its anticipated prospects over the course of 2023 relative to the total enterprise and the guidance you gave this morning. Is there a way to frame the expectations for organic growth and operating profit growth of that North American cereal portion of the business relative to the total company guidance you gave today?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. We don't go into that category level, but you can look at the momentum that we have and the comments I made earlier. We plan on continuing that momentum, getting back TDPs that were lost that's been very successful up to this point and to continue to grow our gross margin. We came to a low point, obviously, because of the fire and strike. So we're coming off that. But the underlying momentum, the trajectory of the business, we feel very good about, and we aim to continue that trajectory.\nStephen Powers: Okay. Thank you very much.\nJohn Renwick: Operator, we are at 10:30, so we are out of time. But everybody, thank you for your interest in Kellogg. And please give us a call if you have any follow-up questions.\nOperator: Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your line.",

            "name": "Steven Cahillane",
            "content": "Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. The fourth quarter completed what was an excellent year, competitively, financially, and in terms of the grit and skill, our organization demonstrated in executing through what were truly extraordinary circumstances. The strength of our snacks portfolio was clearly evident with double-digit net sales growth across all regions underpinned by strong end market performance. We sustained exceptional growth in emerging markets led by our noodles and other portfolio in Africa, but also posting strong growth in snacks and cereal across EMEA and Latin America.  We mitigated the profit impact of unusually high input costs that accelerated during the year, leaning into productivity and carefully executed revenue growth management actions. We navigated through economy wide supply bottlenecks and shortages and worked to restore capacity in much of our business, most notably in North America Cereal and North America Frozen Foods. The result of all of this was strong financial delivery that exceeded expectations throughout the year prompting us to raise guidance more than once this year for net sales, operating profit and EPS and still over deliver that guidance thanks to a strong fourth quarter. We also announced, planned, and made significant progress towards a separation of our company that will not only improve performance of North America Cereal Co., but provide clearer visibility into the strength of the snacks oriented parent company.  With all of this going on and amidst global supply disruptions and high costs, we kept our focus on sustaining momentum in all of our businesses. We stay true to our deploy for growth strategy, leveraging our growth shaped portfolio, orienting our brand building and innovation towards winning occasions and sustaining momentum in our biggest world class brands, all while working to restore service levels and leveraging all levers of revenue growth management in an attempt to keep up with soaring cost inflation. The results of this focus on sustaining momentum are shown clearly in our organic net sales growth which is shown on Slide Number 6. Not only did our sales come in ahead of expectations every quarter, but our growth accelerated sequentially every quarter and this growth was impressively broad based in all four of our regions and in all four of our major category groups, snacks, cereal, frozen and noodles and other. We also remain committed to our better day's strategy towards environmental, social, and governance practices. Slide Number 7 show some examples of tangible actions taken and recognitions received during the fourth quarter alone, illustrating this continued commitment. And you can expect us to maintain this focus on execution and reliable financial delivery in 2023.  Slide Number 8 shows that you can expect many of the same drivers of this financial delivery as we saw in 2022. Our snacks business, which is roughly half of today's Kellogg Company should see sustained momentum led by truly world class brands. In our strong emerging markets businesses, we expect to continue to drive growth and manage through what are always interesting macroeconomic conditions. Input cost inflation remains high, which means we will again be focused on realizing productivity and cost savings supplemented by utilizing all levers of our database revenue growth management disciplines around the world. And we continue to progress on our supply recovery in specific businesses. As a result, we are forecasting growth in net sales and operating profit that are above our long-term targets even as we continue to invest in the enhancement of capabilities, service levels, and the strength of our brands.  Meanwhile, we continue to March towards the separation into more focused companies, starting with the spinoff of North American Cereal Company still scheduled for late this year. Work has progressed on the carving out of financials, the designing of new organizations, and the separation of key systems and processes. Separately, you'll recall that we were exploring strategic options for the plant based food business which represents about 2% of our company's net sales. Given current market conditions as well as our confidence in this business as a long-term growth vehicle, we have decided to retain it as part of global snacking company. We remain as confident as ever in the value to be created by making global snacking company and North American Cereal Company more focused with better visibility into and valuation of their performance and outlook. In short, we are poised for another good year of results.  Before discussing our businesses in detail, let me now turn it over to Amit for a review of our financials. Thanks, Amit. Let's start with Kellogg North America on Slide Number 21. As you can see, our largest region performed very well in 2022, straight through the fourth quarter. We started the year with a lingering inventory impact and costs arising from the second half 2021 fire and strike as well as other supply disruptions. And quarter-by-quarter, we executed well, both from a supply chain perspective and a commercial perspective, finishing the year with very strong net sales and operating profit growth.  Within North America, our largest segment is snacks, representing over half of our sales in the region. And this segment led the way in 2022, as shown on Slide Number 22. There was some timing of shipments, particularly year-over-year within the quarters, but North America Snacks finished the year in double-digit growth. In fact, North America Snacks has accelerated its organic net sales growth in each of the past four years. Leading the way were world-class brands like Pringles and Cheez-It, both of which generated double-digit consumption growth in 2022, and Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Treats, both of which sustained their multiyear momentum as well. Our North America Cereal business, as depicted on Slide Number 23. This business overcame enormous obstacles on its way to delivering very strong net sales growth. We entered the year depleted on finished goods inventories. As we rebuild those inventories, SKU by SKU, we were able to replenish retailer shelves more quickly than we anticipated. And during the second half, we were able to ramp up our commercial programs, and we've entered the new year with real momentum. Slide Number 24 shows the end market progress we have made since restoring inventories and commercial activity. As you can see, our performance has continued to improve sequentially, accelerating both our consumption growth and our share recovery. This business is back on track and is poised to sustain growth in 2023 when we will have a full year of commercial activity. In addition, with supply back in place, this business has begun to restore its profit margins. North America Frozen Foods is shown on Slide Number 25. This was another business that ran into capacity and supply challenges in 2022. For Eggo, it was simply a matter of strong demand over the last couple of years, putting us up against capacity. We put in capacity in midyear and since that time, Eggo's consumption growth has accelerated. And for Morningstar Farms, we experienced significant production issues at a co-manufacturer. During the fourth quarter, supply came back online and almost immediately, we saw signs of improvement in market. So moving to Slide Number 26, Kellogg North America has all the pieces in place for another good year in 2023. Our snacks brands are demonstrating undeniable momentum, and they represent more than half of our North America regions net sales. Our cereal business continues to outpace what has been very strong category sales growth as we continue to ramp up commercial activity. And our frozen businesses are getting past some severe supply constraints. Meanwhile, our productivity and revenue growth management actions are catching up to what has been steadily rising input cost inflation just as we are starting to see signs of bottlenecks and shortages receding. The result should be margin improvement for North America this year. And of course, North America will be moving full speed ahead with the carving out and spinning off of North America Cereal Company. We're making good progress with detailed implementation plans, all while remaining focused on delivering good financial results and executing in the marketplace. Now let's turn to Europe and Slide Number 27. Cost inflation accelerated faster in this region than others, particularly when energy prices and other costs soared after the outbreak of war in Ukraine. Our revenue growth management actions have yet to catch up to the accelerated cost pressures, pulling down profit in the last couple of quarters and will likely remain a pressure on profits into the first half of 2023. The fourth quarter also featured a meaningful year-on-year increase in brand investment. Nevertheless, Kellogg Europe had another good year, posting its fifth straight year of growth in both organic net sales and operating profit. Leading the way were snacks, which now represent more than half of our Europe region's net sales, as shown on Slide Number 28. And aside from the Russia impact and year-ago comparisons in quarter three, this segment drove strong double-digit net sales growth all year. This momentum is not new. This was our fifth straight year of organic net sales growth for Europe snacks. End market, Pringles generated strong consumption growth across key markets in the quarter and the full year. And in the UK, we also delivered rapid growth for Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Squares. Turning to our European cereal business and Slide Number 29, you can see that this business continues to deliver steady growth. On the strength of commercial activities and revenue growth management needed to cover rising costs, this business showed sequential acceleration in its organic net sales growth in each quarter. End market, category growth rates in markets across the region picked up in the fourth quarter, and we have been particularly pleased with accelerated growth and share gains for brands like Rice Krispies in the UK, Tresor in France, and Special K in several markets. So you can see that Kellogg Europe remains in very good condition as we head into 2023. As indicated on Slide Number 30, we expect to sustain momentum in snacks led by Pringles, but also increasingly accompanied by portable wholesome snacks like Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Squares. In cereal, we have strong brand plans, including renovation and innovation and a campaign celebrating our 25th year of our Better Days social program in the UK. We will continue to manage through cost and supply pressures, which are particularly heavy in the first half. And we have an agreement to divest our Russia business, though the deal's timing, approvals and final details are still pending. This business represents a little more than 5% of Kellogg Europe's total sales. So the impact of this divestiture should not be meaningful to adjusted basis results. Now let's turn to Latin America on Slide Number 31. As the chart shows, Kellogg Latin America grew net sales and operating profit strongly, both in the fourth quarter and full year. In fact, this region posted strong and accelerating organic net sales growth all year attributed to its brands, its commercial execution, and its expansion of route-to-market capabilities as well as its revenue growth management actions and its agility in managing through supply challenges.  Our snacks business in Latin America is shown on Slide Number 32. This business has grown consistently over the years. In 2022, it led the organic net sales growth for the region with year-on-year growth of more than 20% in both the fourth quarter and the full year. The growth was broad-based, finishing the year with the fourth quarter that featured strong double-digit net sales gains across all of our sub regions, Mexico, Brazil, Pacific and the Caribbean and Central America region. The strong growth in the quarter and year was driven by price/mix needed to cover soaring cost inflation and adverse transactional currency impact. And while volume did decline, the elasticity was below historical levels. End market data shows sustained double-digit category growth in the quarter and the full year for our major salty snacks markets, with Pringles gaining share in both of its biggest Latin America markets, which are Mexico and Brazil. Our cereal business in Latin America also grew net sales organically in the fourth quarter and full year, as indicated on Slide Number 33. Early in the year, this business felt the impact of supply disruption coming out of North America's fire and strike, particularly in our Caribbean business. But as you can see, once that was behind us, our cereal net sales reaccelerated strongly. In market, our consumption growth was robust across the region in the quarter and the full year, led by key brands like Frosted Flakes in Mexico and Brazil, Corn Flakes in Brazil and Puerto Rico, and Froot Loops in Colombia. So moving on to Slide Number 34, Latin America, too, is poised for another good year in 2023. We expect to sustain momentum in snacks, led by Pringles, and we expect to continue to grow in cereal. We expect to improve profit margins this year, and work is well under towards carving out our Caribbean cereal business into the North American Cereal Company spin-off. We'll finish up our regional review with EMEA, shown on Slide Number 35. This region continues to deliver exceptional top line and bottom line growth. Net sales grew organically in the high teens or better all year long. In the fourth quarter, as for the full year, this growth was broad-based with growth across all of our sub regions, Africa, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and the Middle East and North Africa. The growth was also strong across all of our category groups: cereal, snacks and noodles and other. Despite enormous cost pressures, the region also delivered double-digit profit growth on a currency-neutral adjusted basis both in the fourth quarter and the full year. Snacks in EMEA posted outstanding organic net sales growth all year, as shown on Slide Number 36. This growth was led by emerging markets ranging from Asia, Africa to the Middle East. And it was led by Pringles, which sustained strong consumption and share growth across key markets, both in the quarter and for the full year. In Australia, we also realized good consumption growth in Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Treats both for the quarter and the full year. This bodes well for further international expansion of those brands. Cereal also posted strong organic net sales growth all year, as shown on Slide Number 37. As with snacks, the growth was led by price mix, with elasticity impact on volume being lower than usual. And we saw growth across all sub regions, both in the fourth quarter and the full year. Growth was most pronounced in Africa and the Middle East, but it also remained solid in Asia and Australia. Overall, for the measured markets of this region, we grew consumption and share in the fourth quarter and the full year. Our most developed market, Australia, posted strong consumption growth in the quarter and year, led by many of our biggest brands, including double-digit gains for corn pops, corn flakes and Sultana Bran.  We also sustained good consumption growth in emerging markets with particular strength in India. And then we come to the largest segment of EMEA, noodles and other, which is shown on Slide Number 38. In every quarter this year, our EMEA noodles and other business recorded organic net sales growth of well over 20%. In fact, it has delivered double-digit organic growth every year since we consolidated the distributor portion of our West African business in 2018. Turning to Slide Number 39, we expect another year of strong top and bottom line growth for EMEA in 2023. Macro conditions can be challenging in Africa, and we have an experienced management team and joint venture partner to execute through them, which should enable us to sustain momentum in noodles and other. We should continue to see growth in cereal, led by our markets in Asia and we believe there is plenty of runway for Pringles to continue its strong growth. Meanwhile, EMEA will be looking to improve its profit margins as well. So with that, allow me to briefly summarize with Slide Number 41. From our results and our outlook, it should be very clear that our Deploy for Growth strategy has us focused on the right priorities and building the right capabilities and that our portfolio has been shaped decidedly towards growth. And following our planned separation later this year, visibility into the strength and performance of this portfolio will be even clearer. In fact, the vast majority of our portfolio is enjoying very strong momentum right now, as shown on Slide Number 41, and this is expected to drive above-target growth in net sales and operating profit in 2023. I want to thank our talented and dedicated Kellogg employees for making sure that nothing, not unusual economic conditions, not declining financial markets and pension accounting, not the preparation of a historical spin-off will distract us from continuing to deliver for our stakeholders. And with that, we'll open up the line for your questions. Yes. Sure, Jason. In Europe, it's essentially, we're catching up, right? The inflation came fast and furious, and our ability to catch up to it was impacted in the third and fourth quarter. We also had, obviously, the Russia impact primarily, in the third quarter. Higher A&P continued to bolster our top line, which we're committed to doing. And so we're catching up. It's still going to be a bit of a pressure in the first half, as we mentioned, but our underlying business is very, very solid. And our ability to get price -- earned price has also been solid. It's never easy anywhere, but the European dynamics can be challenging, but we've been making our way through it. And so we have good confidence in the underlying momentum of the business. It's really just -- took a little time to catch up. Yes, we're in reasonable shape right now, Jason. We don't like to talk too much about individual negotiations with our customers. They're doing everything that they always do, which is protect the consumer. We want to protect the consumer as well, be as affordable as possible, but we need to maintain our margins. And we're having those adult conversations, and they're proceeding constructively. Good morning. Yes, Alexia. So for us in North America in the fourth quarter, volume was up. And obviously, overall revenue was up nicely. We did have a fairly easy comparison, particularly in North American cereal because of the fire and strike. On a two-year basis, though, we -- well, first of all, the trajectory of our North American cereal business is very, very solid, and we're very, very pleased with it. On a two-year basis, NSV is also up. I'm not sure what you're looking at, but it is up. Volume is down slightly as the category is. But our NSV on a two-year basis and a one-year basis is up in cereal. And we're very confident about the plans in 2023 that we have in place. We're confident about the distribution that we've been able to gain. We're confident about our shelf sets. Our consumer promotions are, as I said, really back on track. You can see Jalen Hurts and Tony the Tiger on television right now as a matter of fact, which is lucky for us that Jalen is in the Super Bowl. So feeling very good about our North American cereal recovery on a one year and two-year basis. Yes. So it's different everywhere around the world. The U.S. has been strong. It's been relatively inelastic, particularly in our categories. So we've definitely benefited from that. There's no question that the U.S. balance sheet, consumer balance sheet still remains stronger than it was pre-pandemic, although continues to erode over time. The employment situation, as you know, in the U.S. is still very strong. So overall, the consumer in the U.S. is in a good place. And when you look at the categories that we play in, it remains very strong, right. So they are cutting out discretionary items, which, we all know, high-ticket items are under a lot of pressure. Our categories are doing very well.  And if you look at the emerging markets, the same could be said, the consumer is very strong, surprisingly resilient in virtually all of our emerging markets, which has been very positive for our results from a category standpoint. And then we're doing well inside those categories. Europe is where you see -- if you go back a couple of quarters ago, we did indicate that we were seeing the beginning of elasticities returning, particularly in the cereal business, and we're seeing a little bit more of that. So the European consumer, I would say, is probably under more pressure than just about anywhere else in the world. And you see that, obviously, in the discretionary categories, and you're starting to see a little bit more of a normal return to elasticities in the European consumer. Still not back to pre-pandemic levels or what we describe as normal levels, but higher than it is in the rest of the world. Yes, Andrew, we really don't have that concern. We haven't seen anything that would point to an irrational environment on the horizon. And as our supply has improved, we've been gradually restoring merchandising activity, which is an effective complement to our brand building, always has been. And so it's not a bad thing. It's not a bad thing to obviously drive displays, as you well know, drive merchandising activity. And from a supply standpoint, it's not as if there's a lot of excess capacity in our categories for us, certainly, and I think even for some of our competitors. So when you look at that, when you look at the supply availability, when you look at the demand creation, which is out there, and available, I see a very rational environment on the horizon. Yes, Rob, I would say definitely will improve in 2023. That is our plan. And the process was very thorough. We said from the beginning, we were going to pursue a spin but would look at other strategic alternatives. We did that. And if you recall, when we began this process, valuation for peer companies were stratospheric compared to where they are today. They've come down quite substantially. So the thesis when we started the process was to truly unlock shareholder value if we could attract the same types of multiples in the public market, we should pursue that. The environment has clearly changed. And when we look at what's on the horizon for this category, we see an imminent shakeout coming. It's happening already. And there'll be a couple of players left standing, and Morningstar Farms still has some of the highest household penetration, highest name recognition, fantastic foods, strong in the freezer space where this consumer is migrating back to, and profitable, unlike many of the peers. So as we step back and look at it, we are the best parent for Morningstar Farms. And when we shared with our people this morning that we were keeping the business, there was elation. And so there's a lot of momentum underlying in our people, in their plans, and we're optimistic for 2023. And more importantly, we're optimistic beyond that because when the shakeout continues, there'll be a few left standing. And the underlying consumer drivers around health and wellness, around environmental concerns, around moving away from animal proteins, all still remain. And Morningstar Farms has one of the cleanest labels out there. And so there's a lot going from Morningstar Farms, and we're excited to keep it. Yes. Thanks, Bryan. I think it will be part of the strategy. Obviously, we're going to execute the spin. That's priority number one. And we'll execute the spin, and we'll have a global snacking company with a very strong balance sheet, cereal company as well. And so as we look for opportunities, we'll look for organic and inorganic opportunities. And our organic opportunities, as you can see, with Pringles remain exceptional, with Cheez-It, Rice Krispies Treats, remain exceptional. Cheez-It is only now really leaving the United States and expanding overseas in Canada, Brazil, and soon other geographies as well. So on balance, we'll look at those opportunities for continued organic growth, but where we can supplement our portfolio with additions, we'll definitely look to that because we do have great capabilities in snacking, great route-to-market, and bolt-ons or bigger will be part of our considerations going forward. Well, Bryan, you never say never, obviously, right. But we are very, very confident that there's no condition by which we won't execute the spin by the end of this year. It's a tax-free spin-off, a dividend to our shareholders really. And so we don't have to rely on the debt markets. We don't have to rely on IPO markets, equity markets. It's a dividend to our shareowners and nothing is without risk, but we have a very high degree of confidence, and we absolutely plan on executing this by the end of the year. Thanks Bryan. Yes, Eric, thanks for the question. I'd say there's nothing unusual that we're lapping aside from an easier comp when we get to the Russian comparisons is one. And the first half is really the catch-up -- pricing catching up to costs, and we're very confident that we're going to do that. The underlying brand strength remains very strong. Europe has just completed their fifth year of growth and so it's been a long story of underlying momentum driven by great execution on Pringles. We've got a great plan for Pringles again based on a number of different activities, strong consumer engagement, strong customer engagement with Pringles. Our cereal brands remain strong. And one of the real surprises has been our portable wholesome snacks has really returned to growth and is doing quite well. And so it's a first half, second half, but it's really more in terms of catching up, which we're in process of doing. And we can see it. We can see it in our forecast that it's happening, and it gives us a great deal of confidence that there'll be a sixth year of growth in Europe. You want to add anything? I'll start with the pricing and let Amit take the CAPEX. I'll start with what we always talk about in terms of we're not going to get into forward-looking pricing and customer negotiations and things of that nature, but we always start with the first line of defense against rising costs is productivity. And so this is -- the receding of bottlenecks and shortages have given us the opportunity to really put together more historic productivity plans because all that noise is starting to recede. And so we will have an aggressive productivity plan. But as Amit talked about, our intention is to stabilize margins to slightly grow them. So that's going to require revenue growth management throughout the year, and that'll look different throughout the year, depending on what geography it is. But that is our intention. Yes. We don't go into that category level, but you can look at the momentum that we have and the comments I made earlier. We plan on continuing that momentum, getting back TDPs that were lost that's been very successful up to this point and to continue to grow our gross margin. We came to a low point, obviously, because of the fire and strike. So we're coming off that. But the underlying momentum, the trajectory of the business, we feel very good about, and we aim to continue that trajectory."

            "name": "Amit Banati",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide Number 10 provides a summary of our 2022 financial results. A better than expected performance in quarter four drove us to hit or exceed our guidance for the full year. Our net sales led the way accelerating to 16% organic growth in the fourth quarter and resulting in 12% organic growth for the year, which was higher than expected. This top line growth more than offset a sizable year-on-year increase in investment resulting in our adjusted basis operating profit growing 20% on a currency neutral basis in quarter four. This brought our full year growth to 7%, also exceeding expectations.  Our adjusted basis earnings per share increased 17% on a currency neutral basis in quarter four despite being weighed down by the as anticipated increase in interest expense and reduction in pension income related to the decline in financial markets. This quarter four performance resulted in full year EPS growth of 5% on a currency neutral adjusted basis, ahead of our expectations. Cash flow came in at about $1.2 billion and increased from the prior year and in line with our expectations. Excluded from our currency neutral results of course is foreign currency translation, which reduced our net sales, operating profit, and earnings per share by about four percentage points in quarter four and about the same for the full year EPS.  Now let's look at each metric in a little more detail. Slide Number 11 plays out the components of our strong net sales growth. Our double-digit organic growth and net sales in 2022 was driven by price mix which accelerated in the second half as we continued to execute revenue growth management actions around the world to cover accelerated input cost inflation. Volume grew slightly in the quarter due to continued recovery in North America Cereal and declined only modestly for the full year, reflecting both price elasticity that has not moved up as much or as soon as we had expected, as well as our replenishment of trade inventories during the year as our supply improved. Foreign currency translation was a headwind all year, with particularly adverse impacts in quarter three and quarter four.  Let's discuss gross profit on Slide Number 12. Supply disruptions created incremental costs and inefficiencies throughout the year and input cost inflation accelerated across the year. Yet because of productivity efforts and effective revenue growth management actions around the world, we were able to largely offset the dollar impact of those higher input costs and we grew our overall gross profit dollars this year. In fact, our gross profit dollars came in higher than expected both in quarter four and the full year. From a percentage margin perspective, though, there is a mechanical impact of matching input cost inflation which price realization. And because we could not cover the unpredictable inefficiencies from economy wide bottlenecks and shortages. We did see year-on-year increase in gross profit margin in quarter four as we lapped the first of two quarters impacted by the fire and strike and we finished the full year in line with expectations we had communicated. In 2023 we expect to continue to grow gross profit dollars while our margin stabilizes and improves slightly during the year. Some of this is related to the fire and strike impact being one time in nature largely isolated to quarter four 2021 and quarter one 2022. And some of it will come from bottlenecks and shortages gradually diminishing. But this improved margin performance will also be driven by price realization catching up to input cost inflation that is expected to moderate in the back half of the year. Moving down the income statement on Slide Number 13, we see how our SG&A accelerated its year-on-year increase across the year just as we said it would. After having been curved during severe supply disruptions including the fire and strike in North America our advertising and promotion investment was ramped back in the second half and finished the year roughly flat with 2021. Overhead meanwhile increased year-on-year in all four quarters as we gradually returned to travel and meetings and as we accrued higher incentive compensation related to our above budget financial performance. In 2023 the quarterly phasing of SG&A expense will be affected by lapping last year's North America's Cereal pull back on brand building in the first half and rapid ramp up in the second half.  Slide Number 14 shows our continued upward trajectory on operating profit. Operating profit in the fourth quarter was up 16% year-on-year including a negative currency translation impact of almost 4 percentage points. While it was lapping a year earlier decline due to last year's fire and strike, this year's quarter four profits was above that of two years ago. Importantly it featured exceptional topline growth and a significant year-on-year increase in investment. For the full year our operating profit increased by 4% after a negative 3% impact for currency translation. As you can see on the slide, this operating profit was not only higher than 2021, it was also higher than two and three years ago.  Slide Number 15 shows are below the line items which were again collectively negative to EPS growth in the quarter and therefore the full year. Driven by non-operating factors, they will be an even larger headwind in 2023. Interest expense was up sharply year-on-year in quarter four as rising interest rates affected the roughly one fifth of our debt that is floating. The quarterly run rate for 2023 interest expense will likely be a bit higher than this quarter four level. Other income decreased in quarter four and the full year. Most of this was related to the media remeasurement of certain U.S. benefit plans, though in quarter four it was partially offset by better than expected FOREX gains and interest income that we do not expect to repeat. As we have discussed previously, the decline in benefit plan income is related to 2022's fall in financial markets, which reduced the value of planned assets and raised interest rates. We remeasured about half of our planned exposure in the second-half of 2022 and 2023 will feel the impact of remeasuring all of our plans. Hence, we could see a year-on-year decline in other income in 2023 that is almost twice the decrease we recorded in 2022. Our effective tax rate came in a little higher than expected in quarter four and therefore the full year, mostly reflecting geography mix. For 2023, we expect the tax rate to be approximately 22%. Our JV earnings and minority interests were collectively flattish year-on-year in quarter four, finishing the year higher than last year, led by good performance by our joint ventures. Collectively, these are expected to be relatively flat in 2023. And average shares outstanding were flattish in 2022 as increased options exercises by employees over the course of the year offset the benefit of share buyback executed early in the year.  Our cash flow and balance sheet also remained in very good shape as shown on Slide Number 16. Our cash flow increased year-on-year despite year-on-year swings in sales and receivables in December as we lapped last year's fire and strike. This increase in cash flow over the past few years has helped us to reduce our debt right through 2022, leading to lower leverage ratios. This has given us enhanced financial flexibility even as we have continued to increase cash return to shareowners in the form of an increased dividend and buybacks this year. Let's now pivot to 2023, starting with Slide Number 17 and some key assumptions behind our guidance. First and most importantly, we expect to sustain a strong business momentum. Between price realization, the momentum of our categories, and the strength of our brand plans we are confident we can achieve another year of above algorithm net sales growth. And while input costs inflation remains high, it should decelerate year-on-year in the second half, and the same can be said for bottlenecks and shortages. Therefore, we expect to generate above algorithm growth for operating profit as well in 2023. Next, our guidance reflects the impact of headwinds on our non-operating below the line items. Interest expense will increase substantially because of the rise in interest rates worldwide. And non-cash pension income will drop sharply owing to lower asset values entering the year and to a higher interest charge reflecting the rise in interest rates. The pending spinoff of North America Cereal Co, is still targeted to be executed towards the end of the year. For simplicity reasons only our guidance assumes it remains in our results for the full year. Slide Number 18 shows our guidance by key metric. Organic growth in net sales is forecast to be in the 5% to 7% range, another strong year. Given the cost environment this growth will be weighted towards price mix, reflecting revenue growth actions from both 2022 and this year. Importantly, this net sales growth is expected to be broad based across our portfolio and led by momentum in snacks and in emerging markets. On an adjusted basis and excluding currency, we expect operating profit to grow in the 7% to 9% range. This above target growth will be driven by the strong net sales, which drives the growth in gross profit dollars that fuel increased brand building. At the earnings per share level, the strong operating profit growth will be more than offset by the pension and interest headwinds we discussed earlier. The impact of the accounting re-measurement of pension and post retirement alone is negative 7 percentage points to EPS growth. Again, it should be emphasized that this is a noncash, non-operating item, and it was driven by what was a rare steep decline in the financial markets in 2022. Without that item, our EPS would be up 3% to 5%, even despite the higher interest expense and tax rate. Cash flow is expected to come in somewhere between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. Our underlying base business cash flow will continue to grow year-on-year, reaching $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, but there will be roughly $300 million plus of cash outlays related to the pending spin-off. This is a combination of cash costs and capital expenditure, all onetime in nature and all related to executing the transaction and setting up the stand-alone business. So to summarize on Slide Number 19, we continue to feel very good about how we are performing and about our financial condition. Across our regions and category groups, we sustained solid momentum in 2022, and we expect that momentum to continue in 2023. Amidst high cost inflation across inputs and energy, we were able to protect profit dollars through productivity and revenue growth management in 2022, and we will do so again in 2023. In an environment of disruptions up and down the supply chain, we have executed well and steadily improved service levels in 2022 and will continue to do so in 2023. In 2022, we delivered above-target growth in currency-neutral, net sales and operating profit, and we plan on doing that again in 2023. We have increased our cash flow and further deleveraged our balance sheet, giving us excellent financial flexibility going into 2023. And we remain as confident as ever in the value that can be created by spinning off North America Cereal Co. Not only will that business thrive amidst increased focus, but the strength of the remaining global snacking co. will be significantly more visible. So we are looking forward to another good year in 2023. And with that, I'll turn it back to Steve to discuss our individual businesses. Yes. I think, Jason, just looking at the current rates, we'd say probably 1% to 2% impact on EPS and OP, maybe on sales around 3%. So that's kind of the outlook if you look at where the rates are today. And then I think just to build on that from a guidance standpoint, we have incorporated rising elasticity. So that's built into our guidance for 2023. No. I think it's not disproportionate. It's broadly in line with the size of the business. Yes. So I think we are on track to execute the spend towards the end of the year. So leading up to that, we'll be providing all the information as well as having the Investor Day as you'd expect. So towards the end of the year is what we're working towards. I think the $300 million, it's a combination of onetime costs related to executing the transaction. So consultants, I think we're working very closely with some blue-chip advisers on program management, ensuring that we have a comprehensive program to manage the change and develop a comprehensive plan of action. I think it includes your typical banker loyal fees as well, as well as some capital expenditure to realign the supply chain to get IT systems up and running for the new cereal company. I think on a full year basis, it will be flat to slightly up on gross margins, and I think it'll improve progressively as we go through the year. So I think that's kind of the range where we are on gross margin. And then I think from -- and I think just the puts and goals in gross margin, obviously, from a positive, we've been lapping the fire and the strike. We do expect bottlenecks and shortages to moderate as we go through the year. We are starting to see that in -- as well. So that, I think, would be a positive tailwind from a gross margin standpoint.  I think from an input cost standpoint, we expect mid-teens inflation, and that's what our guidance incorporates. So it's still elevated. It's moderated from what we saw in 2022, but still elevated. And I think we continue to see input cost inflation in oils, in corn, in wheat, rice, potatoes. So that's been built in. And I think from a phasing standpoint, we'd expect gradual improvement in the year-on-year change of gross profit margin as the year progresses.  And then I think to your question on SG&A -- now I think on your question on SG&A, I think we'd expect an increase in overheads broadly in line with inflation, I think as normal activity continues to restore. And then from a brand building standpoint, we'd expect an increase as we -- as supply is restored full year of brand building through the year. Yes. I think certainly, from a gross margin standpoint, as I mentioned, right, we'd be lapping the fire and strike in quarter one. But I think on the brand building in particular, right, if you recall, last year in quarter one and quarter two, we had pulled back as we were emerging from the strike. So you're going to have that negative lap in quarter one and into quarter two as well. So it's kind of -- those are the puts and goals from an operating profit phasing standpoint. No, I think just building on the phasing comment, I think we'd be expecting to catch up on the pricing at an increasing rate through the first half. And then I think in the second half, the combination of the pricing having been caught up as well as easier comp and, hopefully, moderating inflation, I think, would lead to a higher growth, OP growth in the -- operating profit growth in the second half. No, we haven't, but we'll certainly study that. And I think in terms of the onetime costs and the phasing through the year, I mean, we're right in the middle of the program. And so I think you could expect it to be spent through the year. So there's nothing particular to call out in that."

Welcome to the Kellogg Company's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session with publishing analysts.  At this time I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for Kellogg Company. \nJohn Renwick : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for a review of our third quarter results and an update regarding our outlook for 2022. I'm joined this morning by Steve Cahillane, our Chairman and CEO; and Amit Banati, our Chief Financial Officer. Slide number three shows our forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware, certain statements made today such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance, are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the third slide of this presentation, as well as to our public SEC filings. This is a particular note amidst the current operating environment, which includes unusually high input cost inflation, global supply disruptions and uncertain global macroeconomic conditions, all of whose direction, length and severity are so difficult to predict.  A recording of today's webcast and supporting documents will be archived for at least 90 days on the Investor page of kelloggcompany.com. As always, when referring to our results and outlook, unless otherwise noted, we will be referring to them on an organic basis for net sales and on a currency-neutral adjusted basis for operating profit and earnings per share.  And now, I'll turn it over to Steve.\nSteven Cahillane: Thanks John and good morning everyone. We are delighted to be able to report yet another quarter of momentum, progress, better than expected results and an improved full year outlook. Our organization once again exhibited grit and creativity in navigating and executing through a global operating environment that showed little to no signs of easing.  We continue to improve our service levels in spite of persistent bottlenecks and shortages of everything from materials and equipment to trucks and containers. We also continued to mitigate the profit impact of exceptionally high cost inflation with good execution of productivity initiatives and revenue growth management actions, and even in this unusual operating environment, we again saw the strength of our portfolio play out.  We sustained our strong growth momentum in snacks around the world and our emerging markets saw strong growth in all key category groups. And in our North America Cereal business, we continue to recover inventory and share more quickly than expected from enormous disruptions late last year.  At the same time, work continues on the planned separations which we announced in June. A recent milestone was the announcement of our North America serial company leadership team and we continue to work on organizational design and carve out financials. And through all this, we delivered a financial performance for quarter three that exceeded our expectations and enables us to raise our guidance for the full year. In short, another good quarter, adding to a track record of dependable delivery and with plenty of reasons to be confident that this kind of delivery can continue.  You can tell our Deploy for Growth strategy is working from the quality of our results. Slide number six shows one key metric, our net sales growth. As you know, our momentum is not new. Our third quarter showed acceleration of a trend that has been running above our long term target for the past few years, and while this third quarter acceleration was led by price realization necessary to keep up with soaring costs, the elasticity impact on volume has been less than expected and our world class brands continue to perform especially well in the market.  We are seeing this momentum across markets and category groups. We grew net sales organically in all four regions and in all four category groups within those regions. From snacks to cereal to frozen foods to noodles and other. So this momentum is broad based and long running and another reason to believe in our strategy, portfolio and people. As a key element of our Deploy for Growth strategy, our ESG strategy is also working. A few highlights from quarter three are shown on slide number seven.  Let me now turn over to Amit, who will explain our financial results and outlook in more detail. \nAmit Banati : Thanks Steve and good morning everyone. Slide number nine provides a summary of our third quarter and year-to-date financial results. Our net sales in quarter three grew more than 13% year-on-year on an organic basis, coming in higher than expected and bringing year-to-date organic growth to 10%.  Our adjusted basis operating profit grew 4% on a currency neutral basis in quarter three, overcoming the impact of high costs, bottlenecks and shortages and increased investment. This too was better than expected and it puts a year to date growth at a similar 4%. Our adjusted basis earnings per share declined 3% on a currency neutral basis in quarter three, due to the as anticipated reduction in pension income related to remeasuring the pension assets and interest rates. Nevertheless, through the end of the third quarter, our EPS was up 3% on this currency neutral adjusted basis.  Cash flow through the first three quarters remained well ahead of last year. Excluded from our currency neutral results, of course is foreign currency translation, which reduced our net sales, operating profit and earnings per share by 4 to 5 percentage points each, as the dollar strengthened meaningfully further during the quarter.  Now let's look at each metric in a little more detail. Slide number 10 lays out components of our strong net sales growth this year. Despite supply challenges and our suspension of Pringles shipments to Russia, volume only declined relatively modestly, suggesting that price elasticity has not moved up as much or as soon as we had expected. Price mix accelerated again in quarter three and it accelerated in all four regions as they continue to utilize revenue growth management to help offset higher input costs. All four regions delivered double digit increases in price mix in quarter three. Both of these components, volume and price mix were relatively consistent with the year-to-date trends.  Turning now to gross profits, slide number eleven illustrates how each region is facing enormously high cost pressure. Year-to-date our COGS per kilo inflation has run in the high teens or worse in each region, driven by both input cost inflation and costs and inefficiencies arising from global bottlenecks and shortages, not to mention adverse transactional foreign exchange, and keep in mind that this is net of the good work we're doing on productivity.  Our net sales per kilo, which is how we measure price mix is up in the mid-teens, covering a sizable portion of our input cost inflation. However, it is not able to cover the unpredictable impacts of supply disruptions and the first quarter impacts related to last year's second half fire and strike.  Our net sales per kilo accelerated sequentially in quarter three, in part reflecting revenue growth management actions taken during the quarter. However, our COGS per kilo accelerated too, indicating that these pressures are not behind us.  Slide number 12 shows that our gross profit dollars increased year-on-year, both in quarter three and on a year-to-date basis. During quarter three our margin decline narrowed as we had indicated it would and our net sales grew enough that gross profit dollars increased at a mid-single digit rate year-on-year. So even though our margins have been pressured by the current environment, our gross profit dollars remained on an upward trajectory.  As we look to quarter four, we expect both margins and dollars to increase year-on-year as we lap last year's fire and strike impact. However, based on the current economic conditions, we no longer anticipate bottlenecks and shortages to diminish in quarter four. As a result, while we still expect gross profit margin to increase year-on-year in the quarter, it won't be as much as previously projected. And this will mean finishing the full year with a gross margin that is down a bit more than the 100 basis points previously mentioned, but still growing in dollars.  Moving down the income statement on slide number 13, we see how our SG&A accelerated its year-on-year increase just as we said it would. As expected, advertising and promotion investment increased year-on-year as our U.S. Cereal business resumes commercial activity now that it has got up on inventory. And overhead increased year-on-year, reflecting higher incentive compensation and a resumption of travel and meetings. As we enter quarter four, we expect to see an even larger year-on-year increase in SG&A as North America Cereal, restores more of its commercial activity.  Slide number 14 shows that in spite of these extreme operating conditions, not to mention this year's meaningfully adverse currency translation, we remain on an upward trajectory on operating profit. Operating profit in the third quarter was up 4% year-on-year on a currency neutral basis, and flat after the adverse currency translation. Year-to-date it was up both on currency neutral basis and after adverse foreign exchange. We expect to see that continue in quarter four.  Slide number 15 shows our below the line items which were again collectively negative to EPS growth in the quarter. Interest expense was up modestly year-on-year in quarter three, as lower debt balances were offset by higher interest rates. As we mentioned last quarter, rising interest rates will affect the roughly 20% of our debt that is floating, and this will become much more acute in quarter four.  As expected, other income decreased significantly year-on-year due to the mid-year remeasurement of two of our U.S. Pension plans, which adjust for currently lower asset values and higher interest rates. This will similarly affect other income in quarter four, and as mentioned previously, depending on how financial markets finish this year, this will be an even more significant headwind in 2023 as we\u2019ll have a full year impact across all of our post retirement plans. Of course, this is a non-cash, non-operating item.  Our effective tax rate in quarter three was relatively flat year-on-year after benefiting from country mix and discrete benefits. We now look for our full year effective tax rate to be somewhere above 21.5%.  Our JV earnings and minority interests were collectively down against an unusually high year-on-year period following our mid-year \u201921 consolidation of Africa joint ventures, but remain fairly consistent with more recent quarters, and average shares outstanding were relatively flat year-on-year as the impact of our share buybacks early in the year was offset by increased options exercises by employees. As a result, we now think average shares outstanding will be flattish for the full year.  Our cash flow and balance sheet also remain in very good shape as shown on slide number 16. Our absolute cash flow has remained on an upward trajectory right through quarter three, and this cash flow has enabled us to reduce our net debt over the past few years leading to lower leverage ratios. This has given us enhanced financial flexibility, even as we have continued to increase our cash return to shareowners in the form of an increased dividend and buybacks this year.  Let's now turn to slide number 17 and discuss where we think we'll finish the year. As Steve mentioned, we are raising our guidance today based on our strong quarter three delivery and good top line momentum going into quarter four. We are raising our full year outlook for organic net sales growth to approximately 10%, a sizable increase from our previous guidance of 7% to 8%. This reflects our better than expected performance in quarter three and it implies continued double digit growth in the fourth quarter led by price mix and sustained momentum in our business, partially offset by rising price elasticity and Russia impact.  This improved sales outlook is prompting us to raise our full year outlook for adjusted basis, currency neutral operating profit growth to approximately 6%, up from our previous guidance of 4% to 5%. This is despite sustained high teens cost inflation and our revised assumption around bottlenecks and shortages, which we now expect to persist through the fourth quarter.  We are also raising our full year outlook for adjusted basis earnings per share growth to approximately 3% growth on a currency neutral basis, up from our previous guidance of 2%. This reflects the higher operating profit outlook, partially offset by a worsened outlook for below the line items. This includes our remeasured pension income and higher interest expense due to the rise in rates, only partially offset by an effective tax rate that comes down slightly because of Q3\u2019s favorability.  We deliberately stick to currency neutral guidance because of the difficulty in protecting foreign exchange rates. But because of the dollar's meaningful strengthening lately and the number of investor questions we received regarding its impact, I will mention that if today's exchange rates were to hold, we would absorb a negative impact of 3% to 4% on a full year net sales, operating profit and EPS growth, and a higher negative impact in quarter four.  Our full year outlook for cash flow remains approximately $1.2 billion. Remember that this guidance incorporates incremental upfront cash outlays in 2022, related to the previously announced separation transactions.  So to summarize, our financial position on slide number 18, we feel very good about how we are performing and our financial condition. Our business is showing strong underlying momentum. Our efforts around productivity and revenue growth management are helping to mitigate unusually high cost pressures. We are raising our outlook for the full year, largely on the strength of what we've already delivered, and our cash flow and balance sheet are giving us good financial flexibility.  And with that, I'll turn it back to Steve to discuss our individual businesses. \nSteven Cahillane: Thanks Amit. I'll start with a review of each of our regions beginning with Kellogg North America on slide number 20.  This region had another good quarter, delivering notably strong net sales growth with organic growth in both volume and price mix. Our sales growth was led by what is by far our largest business in North America and that\u2019s snacks. This business had another quarter of strong organic volume growth and price realization, and its net sales growth acceleration was accompanied by a similar acceleration in consumption. We'll talk more about these brands in a moment.  Cereal in North America also recorded another quarter of accelerated net sales growth, reaching double digits year-on-year, roughly in line with its consumption growth. We'll talk more about this business's rapid recovery also in a minute.  In our Frozen businesses where we've experienced pronounced supply constraints this year, we return to organic net sales growth in the quarter. This was aided by newly installed waffle capacity. Kellogg North America in the third quarter delivered sequentially better operating profit growth as well, despite no let-up in input cost inflation or bottlenecks and shortages and despite increased reinvestment. So overall, North America continues to perform well and is poised for a strong finish to a strong year.  Kellogg\u2019s Europe's results are shown on slide number 21. Ever since the war broke out in Ukraine, we've known that Kellogg\u2019s Europe would have two very different halves of the year. Because as we suspended Pringles shipments into Russia right away during the first quarter, it took some time to work through inventories. Now in the second half, we feel the brunt of this lost revenue and profit.  Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine has contributed to a surge in energy costs and bottlenecks and shortages, as well as devaluations in currencies against the U.S. dollar and a pinched consumer that is contributing to increasing elasticities, at least on Cereal. And yet Kellogg Europe in the third quarter still managed to sustain top line growth and mitigate the profit pressure, even as it lapped the year earlier quarters, enormous sales and profit growth.  In snacks which represent almost half of Kellogg Europe sales, the lost sales in Russia were more than offset by double digit organic growth elsewhere. Pringles maintained its double digit consumption growth momentum, and portable wholesome snacks are generating strong consumption growth on the strength of Pop-Tarts, Rice Krispies Squares and Barrette Nut Bars. Cereal net sales also grew organically, reflecting revenue growth management and broad based consumption growth, even as price elasticity continued to move toward historical levels. The fourth quarter faces similar Russia and cost headwind as quarter three, as well as increased reinvestment, but the underlying momentum in the business will be sustained.  Let's turn to Kellogg Latin America as shown on slide number 22. Strong organic net sales growth was broad based across the region, with double digit growth in both snacks and cereal and driven by revenue growth management actions.  In snacks, which represent more than a third of our annual net sales in Latin America, we continue to drive very strong consumption growth in key markets, including double digit growth and share gains for Pringles in the key markets of Mexico and Brazil. In Cereal, the net sales and consumption growth was led by Brazil, Columbia and Mexico.  Productivity and revenue growth management actions helped to mitigate the impact of high cost inflation, adverse transactional foreign exchange and supply disruptions, leading the solid growth in Latin America's operating profit. In the remaining quarter this year, Latin America should sustain sales and profit growth, even as we expect price elasticities to rise gradually and as we work to offset continued cost inflation and supply challenges.  We'll finish our regional review with Kellogg AMEA in slide number 23. In the third quarter our AMEA region sustained its exceptional momentum, accelerating its organic net sales growth for a third consecutive quarter. From a category perspective, noodles and other is our biggest segment in AMEA, representing almost half of the region sales and led by our West African distributor business, Multipro.  In the third quarter, it sustained organic net sales growth of more than 20%, just as it has all year. Snacks accelerated its organic net sales growth in the quarter, led by Pringles, which sustained its broad based momentum in consumption growth, with notable outperformance in emerging markets. Cereal also sustained good, broad based, net sales growth with particular strength in the Middle East and India.  Despite facing the high cost pressures in the region, a function of input costs, ocean freight costs and adverse transactional foreign exchange, AMEA still managed to grow its currency neutral, adjusted basis, operating profit in the double digits in the third quarter. We expect similar dynamics and momentum to play out in the fourth quarter, making this a very strong year for an AMEA region.  Now let's dig into each of our category groups and brands in a little more detail, shaping our discussion in terms of the businesses that comprise the planned post separation companies. A breakout of these businesses is shown on slide number 24.  As you can see, the businesses that represent 80% of our portfolios net sales today, and they will comprise global snacking company after the separations, have continued to show outstanding growth this year. In fact, this portfolios net sales have grown organically at a double digit rate so far this year. For North America Cereal Company, you can see that our net sales are up organically in the low single digits this year. The only business where there has been softness is Plant Company, which has continued to experience supply disruption as we'll discuss in a moment.  Let's look at each of these businesses and their key brands. Slide number 25 shows how our world-class snacks brands sustained their in-market momentum in the third quarter around the world. Pringles with $2.5 billion in annual net sales globally once again generated double digit consumption growth in virtually every one of our major markets around the world.  Cheez-It with over $1 billion of annual net sales sustained its double digit growth in quarter three, both in Canada and the U.S. where our new Pop'd platform has been incremental to the franchise. Pop-Tarts closing in on $1 billion of annual net sales continued to post good growth in the third quarter in its primary market, the U.S., while continuing to show why we believe it has so much promise internationally.  Rice Krispies Treats with $0.5 billion of annual net sales was supply constrained in the U.S. during the third quarter and still grew consumption in the mid-single digits with its new Homestyle sub-line proving to be incremental to the franchise, and the brand is showing good growth in international markets as well. These are important brands. The four brands collectively represent more than 40% of the total net sales of what will be Global Snacking Company.  Slide number 26 provides a glimpse of our international cereal businesses. As you can see, good consumption growth continued in the third quarter, with the growth led by world class brands and by emerging markets. In more developed cereal markets like those in Europe, Australia, Japan and Korea, we are starting to see price elasticity move higher. Nevertheless, we grew consumption across key European markets in the third quarter with SpecialK, back to growth, aided by a new campaign and the launch of SpecialK Granola with 30% less sugar.  We also grew consumption in Australia, and our consumption is beginning to improve in Japan and Korea on the relaunch and expansion of Granola offerings. In emerging markets, which represent about half of our international cereal sales annually, consumption growth remains robust, both for us and the category. On the slide, note the solid consumption growth rates in key Latin America markets and in India.  Slide number 27 shows the sustained double digit organic net sales growth of our noodles and other category group. This is a $1 billion plus business annually, comprised of our distributor business in West Africa and our Kellogg's branded noodles business elsewhere in Africa and the Middle East. And as we've already discussed, this business again sustained exceptional growth in the third quarter, adding to a track record of consistent double digit or high single digit growth. As we've said before, this reflects the competitive advantage Multipro offers, as well as the value of offering a Kellogg's product line at the lower end of the price pyramid.  Now let's look at frozen breakfast and slide number 28. Eggo is another world class brand in our portfolio with about $750 million in annual net sales globally. In the U.S., the brand has sustained steady consumption growth this year despite being very constrained on capacity for both waffles and pancakes.  But while we remain constrained on pancakes, we did add internal waffle capacity during the second quarter. This enabled our waffles to accelerate consumption gradually during the third quarter, even returning to volume growth, and this has lifted the brands overall consumption growth sequentially as shown on this slide. And another driver of this growth has been the launch of the Liege-Style Waffles, an on-the-go offering that is proving to be incremental to the franchise.  Now let's look at North America Cereal. Slide number 29 shows how our consumption and share are recovering in the U.S., following our unfortunate fire and labor strike in late 2021. Recall that we rebuilt inventory, both our own and that of our retailers faster than anticipated during the first half. In quarter three we have seen our share continue to recover across key brands and this has continued into October. This reflects not only increased on-shelf availability, but also our gradual resumption of commercial activity behind these brands.  The good news is that the category is showing robust growth right now, accelerating to the double digits in quarter three on the strength of increased prices and below average elasticity. The even better news is that our consumption growth has accelerated even faster than the category as you can see in the chart on the left, and our share is already back to its pre-strike level, as you can see on the chart on the right. Clearly we are building momentum as we return to commercial activity, and while this chart focuses on our recovery in the U.S., it has been just as impressive in Canada where we return to share gains in the third quarter.  And in both markets, we have a strong lineup of commercial activity continuing in the fourth quarter. Just a few of these are shown on slide number 30, ranging from innovation like strawberry frosted flakes, the seasonal offerings like Halloween Rice Krispies and the perennial favorite Elf on the Shelf to bringing back indulgent license foods like Cinnabon and Little Debbie.  We have our Mission Tiger program back in full swing and we're experimenting with an innovative just add water product called Instabowls. In short, we feel good about where we are in this business. We've restored inventory levels, we're back on shelf and we are rapidly recovering share. In addition, we've turned back on our commercial programs and equally importantly, we are making good early progress toward restoring profit margins in this business.  We'll now turn to plant based foods in slide number 31. For context, this business represents only about 2% of our total net sales, but it gets a lot of attention because of its promising long-term prospects and because of the recent slowdown of its category. This is a category that experienced the equivalent of a few years' worth of acceleration in a single year 2020. It had already been in elevated growth with new entrants, new technologies and new space in stores, then COVID hit and product proliferation was soaked up by the surge in at-home demand, bringing penetration and buy rates up with it.  The category lapped that surge in 2021 and in 2022 it has experienced a pause in growth and point of distribution have decreased in stores as many retailers consolidated into the frozen aisle. But household penetration remains above pre-COVID levels with ample opportunities to return to consistent growth behind underlying consumer focus on health and environmental concerns. These are demand fundamentals that remain firmly in place for a long runway of growth.  As you know, our MorningStar Farms brand has been severely impacted by supply disruptions at a key co-manufacturer this year, and this disruption has not yet been fully resolved in quarter three. It has also forced us to prioritize SKUs.  While we have not yet been able to fully resume commercial activity, we have been able to support products that are not capacity constrained. A good example is Sausage Links and we are generating double digit consumption and good share growth in that segment. This supply disruption is a temporary issue and we continue to work through it. The brand remains a leader in plant based foods with strong plans and a new media campaign once it restores full supply. So despite near term disruptions, this is a business that remains in good condition with excellent prospects.  So with that, allow me to briefly summarize with slide number 33. I could not be prouder of our organization for how it has navigated through an incredibly volatile environment, identifying issues, resolving them and executing. Our people and culture truly are a competitive advantage for Kellogg. Our strategy is working and our portfolio is showing its strength. We continue to deliver solid results and we are again raising our outlook. Yet we are anything but complacent. We are working hard on a set of plans that will navigate through the current macro headwinds and enable us to drive balanced financial delivery again in 2023 and thereafter.  And with that, we'll open up the line for questions. Operator. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Cody Ross with UBS. Your line is now open. \nCody Ross: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. You are outpacing\u2026\nSteve Cahillane: Good morning Cody. \nAmit Banati: Good morning Cody. \nCody Ross: Hey! Good morning guys. You outpaced Nielson\u2019s consumption by roughly four points this quarter. How much of your 14% organic growth in North America was related to the cereal inventory replenishment and do you expect to continue to ship above consumption moving forward? \nSteve Cahillane: Yes, thanks for the question, Cody. There\u2019s not really any meaningful difference between shipments and consumption. It's moved around a lot obviously, because we had to rebuild inventory on cereal in quarter one, quarter two, but we're pretty much right in balance right now. We may actually see some shipments come out in the fourth quarter, because we're kind of back to where we want to be, but there's not really a meaningful thing to talk about when it comes to differences between shipments and consumption in North America or anywhere around the world for that matter. \nCody Ross: Got you, that\u2019s helpful. And then I just want to talk about the North American profit margin a little bit. The decline accelerated in the quarter. How did that compare to your expectations and what were the key drivers in the quarter? And should we look at the third quarter profit margin as the trough for North America? Thank you. \nSteve Cahillane: Yeah, I'll start and I can turn it to Amit. But you know, North America, if you look at the way they performed in the third quarter and year-to-date, it's pretty exceptional. You know I didn't really think we'd be talking about 14% organic net sales growth in North America, which is really outstanding.  But inflation is running so very hot that you know getting pricing to cover input costs I think is an exceptional achievement and then you've got the bottlenecks and shortages, which are very difficult to price for obviously and to forecast, and so whether or not it's a trough on bottlenecks and shortages remains to be seen.  It stopped getting worse, but there's not a meaningful improvement in it. But you know the price mix in North America was strong, the ability to cover costs was strong, the underlying brand performance was exceptionally strong and so the outlook for North America is strong. It's been a terrific year.  Amit, do you want to\u2026 \nAmit Banati : Yeah, just a couple of other things Cody. So one was, you know we've seen input costs accelerate through the quarter, and I think you know we had talked previously of sequential improvement. We did see the sequential improvement in gross margins, but it was not as much as we expected, and really the primary driver for that was acceleration of input costs, so we saw that happen. We've taken incremental action from a revenue growth management. I think within the quarter there was probably a bit of a lag, so you're seeing the impact of that on margins.  I think as Steve mentioned, bottlenecks and shortages persisted. I think the other factor as well is we resumed as we had said that SG&A would be back and waited. We restored ANP behind cereal as we\u2019ve built back inventory, so you've seen that come through in the quarter as well. And you know we'd expect that in quarter four as well. So you know the SG&A has been kind of back weighted this year. \nCody Ross: Thank you for the color. I'll pass it on. \nOperator: Thank you for your question. The next question is from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Good morning. I know there's always a lot of controversy and talk about stranded costs in the separation. If there's any sort of increased visibility on that, love to hear that. But also a question on Europe. The sales trends are positive, but I'm wondering how you're seeing price elasticity there. I see that volumes are down 8%, so any thoughts about not just the price elasticity, but the ability to get through pricing going forward in Europe would be helpful. Thanks so much. \nSteve Cahillane: Yeah David, I'll start and Amit can add any color. Starting with the stranded costs, we're not prepared to talk about that today. We will be as we get into next year, but we continue to make very solid progress. I would remind you that we've got a lot of experience around this when we divested the portions of the Keebler business. We were very successful at extracting stranded costs. We will have the opportunity to have TSAs as well and the business is growing very, very strongly, so we \u2013 and that the plans are moving forward very nicely. So when we get to the point where we can do that, we\u2019ll of course provide that visibility.  In terms of Kellogg Europe, you know they continue to perform very, very well. This quarter was a tale of what they were lapping last year. So if you look at the operating profit being down, on a two year CAGR, it's actually up over 20% because of that lap. You also have the most impact coming from the stoppage in Russia, obviously what's happening there and so they are cycling that. In terms of pricing, the team has been very, very successful in executing revenue growth management in \u2013 you know in the most difficult environment in the world. They've done an exceptional job. You know we've got David who runs the business there doing a terrific job. Miranda Prins who runs Continental Europe has done an exceptional job with our customers, really putting together joint business plans with them into next year that help us cover, you know cover the high inflation that exists there. So lots of good work happening in Europe, continued strong momentum despite exceptional headwinds.  In terms of elasticity, the one area where we're starting to see a little bit of return to normal elasticity would be in cereal in Europe. In the UK actually it looked like it was starting in Continental Europe, but there's a lot of noise, so I wouldn't point to that as anything significant right now. There's a lot of variables in it, but it's the one area where elasticity is probably emerging faster than anywhere else in the world. \nDavid Palmer: It's helpful, thank you. \nOperator: Thank you for your question. The next question is from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Your line is now open. \nAndrew Lazar : Great! Thanks so much. Steven, in North America cereal, obviously the fire and the strike were certainly disruptive, but I guess I'm curious if there was an opportunity to make any structural changes to how you compete as you return product to the shelf. So like in other words, was there an opportunity to come back with an even more optimized SKU assortment than before or you know as you return to commercial activity.  What are you seeing in terms of ROIs on those activities, again versus like before the strike, or maybe there are other structural elements that you're working on there that I may not be thinking of. And maybe I'm making too much of this and the focus was simply on just getting product back on the shelves. But what I'm trying to do is think ahead of it from here about you know when this unit is ultimately on its own. Thanks so much. \nSteve Cahillane: Yes, thanks Andrew. I'd say we actually are emerging stronger from what was an incredibly trying time. Obviously you have a major fire and then you have a strike that lasts a full quarter, an exceptionally difficult environment. But we were confident that we could restore the business and we have been sequentially and now as we look forward, we're looking at even better year-over-year performance, and that's coming from some of the things that you mentioned.  We did prioritize SKUs. We cut out a number of tails, which allows us to consolidate some of our investment around our strongest brands. So some of the things I mentioned you know, you know Tony the Tiger being back, you know lots of good promotional activity being back, the ROIs are rising for us and you can see that in some of the shares of our leading brands. The pricing we've been and the revenue growth management has been exceptional behind you know those programs and those ROIs. Our shelf sets if you walk the stores look very, very good, you know compared to where they looked only six months ago. So it is about prioritized SKU's, prioritized brand investment, getting the commercial activity back there. Our fourth quarter has got really good innovation coming through that's been well accepted. So I'd say the cereal business has emerged as a stronger business and that's why you heard the optimism when we talk about the business going forward, it's been very strong. And then in Canada, you know even stronger, so terrific job by the team. \nAndrew Lazar : Thanks so much. \nOperator: Thank you for your questions. The next question is from the line of Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nPamela Kaufman : Hi! Good morning. \nA - Steve Cahillane: Good morning.\nAmit Banati: Good morning.\nPamela Kaufman : You pointed to continued challenges on the supply chain and are seeing continued acceleration in inflation. So just wondering what your updated inflation expectation is for this year and can you talk about what you are seeing in the supply chain and where you've seen slower improvement relative to inflation. \nSteve Cahillane: Yes, I'll start on supply chain and turn it over to Amit on inflation, the first part of your question.  On supply chain, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, it has not gotten any worse, right. So you know we were in a position where each quarter continued to accelerate in terms of disruptions, what we call things that get to the attention of our control tower and right now that stopped getting worse. I would say there's not \u2013 as we look out on the horizon, there's not a lot of signals that it's going to get better any time soon or significantly better. So we're operating in an environment that continues to be somewhat tumultuous. But the execution that we're able to bring forward has gotten better and better as we continue to get used to an environment with so many disruptions. And Amit, do you want to talk about inflation?\nAmit Banati: I think from an inflation standpoint, you know we did see meaningful acceleration during the quarter. So we saw input cost inflation at around the 20\u2019s, into the 20\u2019s, and so I think you know from a full year standpoint and we expect similar levels of inflation in quarter four as well. And I think you know given the acceleration we've seen in quarter three into quarter four, I think our full year inflation, you know from the high teens is now kind of pushing close to the 20% level from an inflation standpoint. \nPamela Kaufman : Great! Thanks. And then are you expecting to or do you need to take incremental pricing to offset the inflation that you're seeing in the business, and how should we think about \u2013 and how are you thinking about kind of the balance of incremental pricings versus your commentary around increasing elasticities in certain categories? \nAmit Banati: I think as always, and as you've seen in our results right, it's a combination of productivity, it's a combination of revenue growth management, and I think as you saw in our quarter three results, our price mix accelerated during the quarter. So I think you know the teams are doing a terrific job navigating through what is a high cost inflation environment by taking instrumental actions as needed.  I would say that on gross margins we saw sequential improvement despite all the inflation, we saw sequential improvement in quarter three, and I think our expectation is that we will see margin improve and gross profit dollars improve in quarter four as we lapped you know the fire and strike. I think from a full year gross margin standpoint, our previous guidance was around 100 basis points declined. You know we'd expect that to be a bit more than the 100 basis points that we had guided to, but I think you know that gives you an indication that despite the higher inflation, you know the amount of incremental actions that the teams have taken, and just the strength of our brands. \nPamela Kaufman : Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you for your questions. The next question is from the line of Chris Growe was Stifel. Your line is now open. \nChris Growe : Hi! Good morning. \nA - Steve Cahillane: Good morning Chris! \nChris Growe : Just had a couple of questions for you. The first one, just for you to follow-on a little bit on the questions around Europe just as we're getting a sense of the incremental elasticity in those markets and those other markets as well. Snacks was a little softer in its growth as well. Then I thought, are you seeing that in snacks or was that more of the comp of the prior year? \nA - Steve Cahillane: I think Chris it was more the comp of the prior year. We're really not seeing elasticities in Europe. You know our snacks business led by Pringles is very, very strong. In fact, if you look at \u2013 you know we stopped all shipments into Russia as you know and we quickly diverted all that. You know we were able to sell that volume elsewhere immediately and we're still you know somewhat capacity constrained as the business has been so strong. \nAmit Banati: It was up over 22 \u2013 it was up almost 22% in the year ago quarter Chris. \nChris Growe : Right, I know it was a tough comp. Just have you indicated how much the volume drag in Europe there was from Russia, not shipping into Russia? \nA - Steve Cahillane: Virtually all of Europe's volume declined. \nAmit Banati: Yep. \nChris Growe : Okay, and I just have one follow-on, which is in the AMEA division and the noodles and other business continues to grow very strongly along with the other businesses there. Is that a business that's growing volume as well as pricing. I know it's been a very inflationary environment. Are you seeing volume growth in that business as well?\nSteve Cahillane: It's a pricing story there Chris, it's almost all price. In fact it is all price and our ability to take that level of price has been obviously impressive, but it's a pricing story. \nChris Growe : Okay, thank you for that color. \nA - Steve Cahillane: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. The next question is from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. \nRobert Moskow : Hi! I think Pamela tried to get at this question, but into 2023, I would expect you'd have continued high levels of inflation to get what you're saying about the acceleration in the third quarter. Would it be fair to assume you know double digit inflation in 2023? And then maybe, can you give us a little more color as to why it accelerated in 3Q? I mean we're looking at spot values for commodities and they don't seem to be going up higher sequentially. You know what is your cost going higher?\nA - Steve Cahillane: Yeah, so Rob I would say you definitely should plan on double digit inflation going into next year and I don't think that's going to be unique to Kellogg. In fact, I know it's not going to be unique to Kellogg.  If you look at spot prices, you know it doesn't always tell the full story. Year-over-year price changes even in spot are still up double digits. You know corn up over 20%, cooking oil is up over 20%, wheat in double digits, you know diesel nearing 50%. You know price, you know this whole inflation was going to be transitory, was always obviously ridiculous, and so we continue to see strong inflation ingredients in Coleman, in packaging, across the board.  So I think as a total country and globe, we need to prepare for the same type of inflation, and this is double digit inflation on top of the inflation we've seen this year. So it's a pretty significant macroeconomic event. \nRobert Moskow : Okay, maybe a follow up. It seems like there's more kind of knock-on costs like labor, energy, co-packing. Is it more difficult to pass along those costs to retailers or is there a good understanding that, \u2018hey, that's just the rising cost of business.\u2019 \nAmit Banati: Yeah, I think you know we've largely been successful right in covering inflation on our input costs and our packaging costs, right, and so I think you know \u2013 I think what, from a disruption standpoint, that's probably and you know some of the unplanned, because of supply chain bottlenecks and some of those inefficiencies are probably the ones that you know it's hard to forecast and hard to plan around that we probably have not been able to pass on. \nRobert Moskow : Okay, thank you. \nOperator: Thank you for your question. The next question is from the line of Ken Goldman with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. \nKen Goldman : Hi! Thank you. I just wanted to clarify and make sure I heard correctly what you were saying about the European volumes. I think you said that almost all of the downturn in European volume this quarter was because of the Russia situation. But I also maybe heard you say that that volume was sold elsewhere, so I may have just heard that wrong. I was just trying to get a sense of you know how to think about that as a put and take maybe. \nA - Amit Banati: So I think in the quarter right, when you were lapping, when you compare the Russia business itself right, we stopped shipments in. So yes, you know all the decline was driven by the Russia, by the Russia stop shipments. I think you know the teams have done a remarkable job right, in terms of finding alternative users of that volume, not just in Europe, but around the world into AMEA as well and so I think you know, we've been able to work through that, through the network. \nKen Goldman : Thank you, and then a quick follow up Amit just on the \u2013 and thank you for the guidance regarding pension income into the fourth quarter. You know I understand a lot can change between now and next year and you're not guiding to \u201923. But you did mention that we should expect an incremental headwind in \u201823. So I'm just trying to give a sense for you know how big that headwind might be given that we have obviously limited information about what the stock market and interest rates will be. But are there any rough numbers we can kind of model in, just in comparison to the $38 million other income line we saw this past quarter? \nAmit Banati: Yeah. So I think you know we'd firstly say, we'd expect a similar amount for quarter four right, so I think that's the first thing. Obviously it depends really on what happens on markets, because the remeasurement would really be at the year end, and where the markets are at the end of the year. What we\u2019ve seen this year is like I said, it's about on two of our plans. They are roughly around 50% of our value, of our pension assets, and you've seen it for about half a year.  So you know we'd expect a full year impact next year. We need to re-measure all the plans, but, it really depends on where markets are at the end of the year. So it's hard to forecast and we\u2019ll obviously talk a lot more about that when we are guiding for \u201823 in our February call. And this is not unique to us. I think it's driven by what's happening in interest rates, as well as markets, and it's of course non-operating and non-cash. \nCody Ross: Understood. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you for your question. The next question is from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. \nMichael Lavery: Good morning. \nA - Steve Cahillane: Good morning. \nAmit Banati: Good morning. \nMichael Lavery: Just wanted to come back to revenue guidance and it just looks like the 10% or so on the full year would suggest something around a 7% organic growth in the fourth quarter. I imagine certainly there\u2019s some conservatism, but what would drive a deceleration like that? Is there stepped up promotional spending; is it just your assumptions around elasticities. Can you help us unpack some of how you're thinking about that?\nAmit Banati: Yeah, you know the guidance for the quarter four is roughly in line with the year-to-date rate at double digit levels. So it's \u2013 yeah, so it's similar to that. You would see the Russia impact as we saw in quarter three and quarter four as well. So you know as we cycled the stop shipments of Pringles into Russia. And so you know directionally it's in line with the year-to-date.  As always, you know we made some assumptions around rising pricing elasticity. So we\u2019d see how that plays out. I think also from a lab standpoint, quarter four last year was when we took the most revenue growth management actions last year. So we'd be lapping that. So I think you know there are a couple of factors there, but broadly I'd say that the quarter four guide is in line with the year-to-date rates. \nMichael Lavery: Okay, that's helpful. And just on the developed markets outside the U.S., you touched on the increases in the cereal elasticities. Just as far as how the consumer behavior is evolving, do you have a sense how much they are trading down to something like private label or exiting the category or what's their response been when you see these elasticities growing? \nSteve Cahillane: It hasn't been interestingly trading down, so \u2013 and by the way, it's still low levels of price elasticity. So we're just saying this is the first maybe early indicators that it's returning in some of those regions, but still low, still not back to historical levels. And when you look at private label, there's a lot of variables all around the world, but by and large we see no empirical evidence of private label growing in any of our markets, really in any of our categories in a meaningful way.  We see in fact quite the opposite in some markets and where they are growing, they tend to be growing off year ago comparisons, which were challenged, and so that's really what we're seeing. The concern I think overall is just the absolute nature of household budgets and as inflation throughout the economy continues to rage, you know how that affects the absolute dollars available for households.  But what you see in our categories is we tend to be affected less than discretionary consumer goods and travel and dining out and things of that nature, so. But it's one to watch. We do not take it for granted. We watch our price gaps very much. We continue to invest in our brands. We're not complacent by any means, but we just haven't seen the empirical evidence that private label is making meaningful inroads in any of our categories or geographies. \nMichael Lavery: Okay, thanks so much. \nOperator: Thank you for your question. The next question is from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is now open. \nBryan Spillane: Thanks operator. Good morning guys. Just two quick follow-ups. \nSteve Cahillane: Hi Bryan! \nBryan Spillane: Yep, hi! So just two quick follow-ups. Amit, as I guess with SG&A spending coming back in the second half, is the \u201923 full year SG&A base a reasonably good base to think of for next year or did you end this year still not spending at a normalized level? \nAmit Banati: I think you know we are pleased with the level of spending. I think the phasing and we think we are spending competitively in the marketplace to drive the brands. I think there was some phasing obviously between the first half and the second half, but overall from a full year standpoint right, you know we are pleased with where we are. \nBryan Spillane: Okay, and then just the second one, last one is just related to the discussion about the pension remeasurement and the effect on P&L. Is there any \u2013 are there any cash consequences, you know just given where markets have moved? Is there \u2013 are you fully funded? Will you need to put cash in? Just trying to understand if there's going to be any cash consequences related to that. \nAmit Banati: No cash consequences, really. I mean, you know I think the level of funding, because both your assets and your liabilities go down. So your level of funding is \u2013 you know it moves a little bit, but not meaningfully, so this is really more driven by accounting and like I said, its non-cash, non-operating, and I think the level of funding in the pension plans doesn't change meaningfully. \nBryan Spillane: Okay, great. Thanks guys. \nJohn Renwick: Operator, we might have time for one last question. \nOperator: Thank you. The final question is from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital. Your line is now open. \nNik Modi: Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. The question is just \u2013 I know obviously stranded costs or something you're still looking into, but I was curious if you had a view yet or a strategy on what you're going to do on the supply chain side in terms of which business is actually going to own the trucks, you know just some of that stuff. Will you have a TSA agreement? Just was curious if you had any developments on that front?  And then from a consumer insight standpoint, will the cereal business have to develop its own system or will you be able to leverage existing insight from the snacking company? Thank you. \nSteve Cahillane: If I understand the question, again, next year we'll be providing much more transparent information on it. In terms of things like who owns the trucks, we outsource the vast majority of our logistics right now, so we'll be working through warehousing and all those types of things. But when you look at the scale of both of our businesses, you know they are pretty scaled businesses, so it's \u2013 we're not going to be running half truckloads anywhere. We'll be running full truck loads and it's the work that's being done right now.  And yes, there will be TSA agreements between the businesses, mainly the snacks business providing TSA to the Cereal Co. In terms of things like IT, you know the classic way to do this is you typically clone systems and then separate and we've got a lot of experts helping us with that. A number of us have been through these things before and are you know, you get a lot of experience at it.  So a lot of work going on right now, but what you should hear from us is a very, very high degree of confidence that the work is progressing exactly as we expected and that we have a high degree of confidence in the value creation opportunity that exists, and that's exactly why we're doing it. \nNik Modi: Excellent! Thank you, Steve. \nJohn Renwick: Operator, we are at the hour here. \nOperator: Thank you for your questions. \nJohn Renwick: So everybody, thank you for interest. Thank you for your interest, and if you do have follow-ups, please feel free to call. \nOperator: That concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation.

            "name": "Steven Cahillane",
            "content": "Thanks John and good morning everyone. We are delighted to be able to report yet another quarter of momentum, progress, better than expected results and an improved full year outlook. Our organization once again exhibited grit and creativity in navigating and executing through a global operating environment that showed little to no signs of easing.  We continue to improve our service levels in spite of persistent bottlenecks and shortages of everything from materials and equipment to trucks and containers. We also continued to mitigate the profit impact of exceptionally high cost inflation with good execution of productivity initiatives and revenue growth management actions, and even in this unusual operating environment, we again saw the strength of our portfolio play out.  We sustained our strong growth momentum in snacks around the world and our emerging markets saw strong growth in all key category groups. And in our North America Cereal business, we continue to recover inventory and share more quickly than expected from enormous disruptions late last year.  At the same time, work continues on the planned separations which we announced in June. A recent milestone was the announcement of our North America serial company leadership team and we continue to work on organizational design and carve out financials. And through all this, we delivered a financial performance for quarter three that exceeded our expectations and enables us to raise our guidance for the full year. In short, another good quarter, adding to a track record of dependable delivery and with plenty of reasons to be confident that this kind of delivery can continue.  You can tell our Deploy for Growth strategy is working from the quality of our results. Slide number six shows one key metric, our net sales growth. As you know, our momentum is not new. Our third quarter showed acceleration of a trend that has been running above our long term target for the past few years, and while this third quarter acceleration was led by price realization necessary to keep up with soaring costs, the elasticity impact on volume has been less than expected and our world class brands continue to perform especially well in the market.  We are seeing this momentum across markets and category groups. We grew net sales organically in all four regions and in all four category groups within those regions. From snacks to cereal to frozen foods to noodles and other. So this momentum is broad based and long running and another reason to believe in our strategy, portfolio and people. As a key element of our Deploy for Growth strategy, our ESG strategy is also working. A few highlights from quarter three are shown on slide number seven.  Let me now turn over to Amit, who will explain our financial results and outlook in more detail. Thanks Amit. I'll start with a review of each of our regions beginning with Kellogg North America on slide number 20.  This region had another good quarter, delivering notably strong net sales growth with organic growth in both volume and price mix. Our sales growth was led by what is by far our largest business in North America and that's snacks. This business had another quarter of strong organic volume growth and price realization, and its net sales growth acceleration was accompanied by a similar acceleration in consumption. We'll talk more about these brands in a moment.  Cereal in North America also recorded another quarter of accelerated net sales growth, reaching double digits year-on-year, roughly in line with its consumption growth. We'll talk more about this business's rapid recovery also in a minute.  In our Frozen businesses where we've experienced pronounced supply constraints this year, we return to organic net sales growth in the quarter. This was aided by newly installed waffle capacity. Kellogg North America in the third quarter delivered sequentially better operating profit growth as well, despite no let-up in input cost inflation or bottlenecks and shortages and despite increased reinvestment. So overall, North America continues to perform well and is poised for a strong finish to a strong year.  Kellogg's Europe's results are shown on slide number 21. Ever since the war broke out in Ukraine, we've known that Kellogg's Europe would have two very different halves of the year. Because as we suspended Pringles shipments into Russia right away during the first quarter, it took some time to work through inventories. Now in the second half, we feel the brunt of this lost revenue and profit.  Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine has contributed to a surge in energy costs and bottlenecks and shortages, as well as devaluations in currencies against the U.S. dollar and a pinched consumer that is contributing to increasing elasticities, at least on Cereal. And yet Kellogg Europe in the third quarter still managed to sustain top line growth and mitigate the profit pressure, even as it lapped the year earlier quarters, enormous sales and profit growth.  In snacks which represent almost half of Kellogg Europe sales, the lost sales in Russia were more than offset by double digit organic growth elsewhere. Pringles maintained its double digit consumption growth momentum, and portable wholesome snacks are generating strong consumption growth on the strength of Pop-Tarts, Rice Krispies Squares and Barrette Nut Bars. Cereal net sales also grew organically, reflecting revenue growth management and broad based consumption growth, even as price elasticity continued to move toward historical levels. The fourth quarter faces similar Russia and cost headwind as quarter three, as well as increased reinvestment, but the underlying momentum in the business will be sustained.  Let's turn to Kellogg Latin America as shown on slide number 22. Strong organic net sales growth was broad based across the region, with double digit growth in both snacks and cereal and driven by revenue growth management actions.  In snacks, which represent more than a third of our annual net sales in Latin America, we continue to drive very strong consumption growth in key markets, including double digit growth and share gains for Pringles in the key markets of Mexico and Brazil. In Cereal, the net sales and consumption growth was led by Brazil, Columbia and Mexico.  Productivity and revenue growth management actions helped to mitigate the impact of high cost inflation, adverse transactional foreign exchange and supply disruptions, leading the solid growth in Latin America's operating profit. In the remaining quarter this year, Latin America should sustain sales and profit growth, even as we expect price elasticities to rise gradually and as we work to offset continued cost inflation and supply challenges.  We'll finish our regional review with Kellogg AMEA in slide number 23. In the third quarter our AMEA region sustained its exceptional momentum, accelerating its organic net sales growth for a third consecutive quarter. From a category perspective, noodles and other is our biggest segment in AMEA, representing almost half of the region sales and led by our West African distributor business, Multipro.  In the third quarter, it sustained organic net sales growth of more than 20%, just as it has all year. Snacks accelerated its organic net sales growth in the quarter, led by Pringles, which sustained its broad based momentum in consumption growth, with notable outperformance in emerging markets. Cereal also sustained good, broad based, net sales growth with particular strength in the Middle East and India.  Despite facing the high cost pressures in the region, a function of input costs, ocean freight costs and adverse transactional foreign exchange, AMEA still managed to grow its currency neutral, adjusted basis, operating profit in the double digits in the third quarter. We expect similar dynamics and momentum to play out in the fourth quarter, making this a very strong year for an AMEA region.  Now let's dig into each of our category groups and brands in a little more detail, shaping our discussion in terms of the businesses that comprise the planned post separation companies. A breakout of these businesses is shown on slide number 24.  As you can see, the businesses that represent 80% of our portfolios net sales today, and they will comprise global snacking company after the separations, have continued to show outstanding growth this year. In fact, this portfolios net sales have grown organically at a double digit rate so far this year. For North America Cereal Company, you can see that our net sales are up organically in the low single digits this year. The only business where there has been softness is Plant Company, which has continued to experience supply disruption as we'll discuss in a moment.  Let's look at each of these businesses and their key brands. Slide number 25 shows how our world-class snacks brands sustained their in-market momentum in the third quarter around the world. Pringles with $2.5 billion in annual net sales globally once again generated double digit consumption growth in virtually every one of our major markets around the world.  Cheez-It with over $1 billion of annual net sales sustained its double digit growth in quarter three, both in Canada and the U.S. where our new Pop'd platform has been incremental to the franchise. Pop-Tarts closing in on $1 billion of annual net sales continued to post good growth in the third quarter in its primary market, the U.S., while continuing to show why we believe it has so much promise internationally.  Rice Krispies Treats with $0.5 billion of annual net sales was supply constrained in the U.S. during the third quarter and still grew consumption in the mid-single digits with its new Homestyle sub-line proving to be incremental to the franchise, and the brand is showing good growth in international markets as well. These are important brands. The four brands collectively represent more than 40% of the total net sales of what will be Global Snacking Company.  Slide number 26 provides a glimpse of our international cereal businesses. As you can see, good consumption growth continued in the third quarter, with the growth led by world class brands and by emerging markets. In more developed cereal markets like those in Europe, Australia, Japan and Korea, we are starting to see price elasticity move higher. Nevertheless, we grew consumption across key European markets in the third quarter with SpecialK, back to growth, aided by a new campaign and the launch of SpecialK Granola with 30% less sugar.  We also grew consumption in Australia, and our consumption is beginning to improve in Japan and Korea on the relaunch and expansion of Granola offerings. In emerging markets, which represent about half of our international cereal sales annually, consumption growth remains robust, both for us and the category. On the slide, note the solid consumption growth rates in key Latin America markets and in India.  Slide number 27 shows the sustained double digit organic net sales growth of our noodles and other category group. This is a $1 billion plus business annually, comprised of our distributor business in West Africa and our Kellogg's branded noodles business elsewhere in Africa and the Middle East. And as we've already discussed, this business again sustained exceptional growth in the third quarter, adding to a track record of consistent double digit or high single digit growth. As we've said before, this reflects the competitive advantage Multipro offers, as well as the value of offering a Kellogg's product line at the lower end of the price pyramid.  Now let's look at frozen breakfast and slide number 28. Eggo is another world class brand in our portfolio with about $750 million in annual net sales globally. In the U.S., the brand has sustained steady consumption growth this year despite being very constrained on capacity for both waffles and pancakes.  But while we remain constrained on pancakes, we did add internal waffle capacity during the second quarter. This enabled our waffles to accelerate consumption gradually during the third quarter, even returning to volume growth, and this has lifted the brands overall consumption growth sequentially as shown on this slide. And another driver of this growth has been the launch of the Liege-Style Waffles, an on-the-go offering that is proving to be incremental to the franchise.  Now let's look at North America Cereal. Slide number 29 shows how our consumption and share are recovering in the U.S., following our unfortunate fire and labor strike in late 2021. Recall that we rebuilt inventory, both our own and that of our retailers faster than anticipated during the first half. In quarter three we have seen our share continue to recover across key brands and this has continued into October. This reflects not only increased on-shelf availability, but also our gradual resumption of commercial activity behind these brands.  The good news is that the category is showing robust growth right now, accelerating to the double digits in quarter three on the strength of increased prices and below average elasticity. The even better news is that our consumption growth has accelerated even faster than the category as you can see in the chart on the left, and our share is already back to its pre-strike level, as you can see on the chart on the right. Clearly we are building momentum as we return to commercial activity, and while this chart focuses on our recovery in the U.S., it has been just as impressive in Canada where we return to share gains in the third quarter.  And in both markets, we have a strong lineup of commercial activity continuing in the fourth quarter. Just a few of these are shown on slide number 30, ranging from innovation like strawberry frosted flakes, the seasonal offerings like Halloween Rice Krispies and the perennial favorite Elf on the Shelf to bringing back indulgent license foods like Cinnabon and Little Debbie.  We have our Mission Tiger program back in full swing and we're experimenting with an innovative just add water product called Instabowls. In short, we feel good about where we are in this business. We've restored inventory levels, we're back on shelf and we are rapidly recovering share. In addition, we've turned back on our commercial programs and equally importantly, we are making good early progress toward restoring profit margins in this business.  We'll now turn to plant based foods in slide number 31. For context, this business represents only about 2% of our total net sales, but it gets a lot of attention because of its promising long-term prospects and because of the recent slowdown of its category. This is a category that experienced the equivalent of a few years' worth of acceleration in a single year 2020. It had already been in elevated growth with new entrants, new technologies and new space in stores, then COVID hit and product proliferation was soaked up by the surge in at-home demand, bringing penetration and buy rates up with it.  The category lapped that surge in 2021 and in 2022 it has experienced a pause in growth and point of distribution have decreased in stores as many retailers consolidated into the frozen aisle. But household penetration remains above pre-COVID levels with ample opportunities to return to consistent growth behind underlying consumer focus on health and environmental concerns. These are demand fundamentals that remain firmly in place for a long runway of growth.  As you know, our MorningStar Farms brand has been severely impacted by supply disruptions at a key co-manufacturer this year, and this disruption has not yet been fully resolved in quarter three. It has also forced us to prioritize SKUs.  While we have not yet been able to fully resume commercial activity, we have been able to support products that are not capacity constrained. A good example is Sausage Links and we are generating double digit consumption and good share growth in that segment. This supply disruption is a temporary issue and we continue to work through it. The brand remains a leader in plant based foods with strong plans and a new media campaign once it restores full supply. So despite near term disruptions, this is a business that remains in good condition with excellent prospects.  So with that, allow me to briefly summarize with slide number 33. I could not be prouder of our organization for how it has navigated through an incredibly volatile environment, identifying issues, resolving them and executing. Our people and culture truly are a competitive advantage for Kellogg. Our strategy is working and our portfolio is showing its strength. We continue to deliver solid results and we are again raising our outlook. Yet we are anything but complacent. We are working hard on a set of plans that will navigate through the current macro headwinds and enable us to drive balanced financial delivery again in 2023 and thereafter.  And with that, we'll open up the line for questions. Operator."

            "name": "Amit Banati",
            "content": "Thanks Steve and good morning everyone. Slide number nine provides a summary of our third quarter and year-to-date financial results. Our net sales in quarter three grew more than 13% year-on-year on an organic basis, coming in higher than expected and bringing year-to-date organic growth to 10%.  Our adjusted basis operating profit grew 4% on a currency neutral basis in quarter three, overcoming the impact of high costs, bottlenecks and shortages and increased investment. This too was better than expected and it puts a year to date growth at a similar 4%. Our adjusted basis earnings per share declined 3% on a currency neutral basis in quarter three, due to the as anticipated reduction in pension income related to remeasuring the pension assets and interest rates. Nevertheless, through the end of the third quarter, our EPS was up 3% on this currency neutral adjusted basis.  Cash flow through the first three quarters remained well ahead of last year. Excluded from our currency neutral results, of course is foreign currency translation, which reduced our net sales, operating profit and earnings per share by 4 to 5 percentage points each, as the dollar strengthened meaningfully further during the quarter.  Now let's look at each metric in a little more detail. Slide number 10 lays out components of our strong net sales growth this year. Despite supply challenges and our suspension of Pringles shipments to Russia, volume only declined relatively modestly, suggesting that price elasticity has not moved up as much or as soon as we had expected. Price mix accelerated again in quarter three and it accelerated in all four regions as they continue to utilize revenue growth management to help offset higher input costs. All four regions delivered double digit increases in price mix in quarter three. Both of these components, volume and price mix were relatively consistent with the year-to-date trends.  Turning now to gross profits, slide number eleven illustrates how each region is facing enormously high cost pressure. Year-to-date our COGS per kilo inflation has run in the high teens or worse in each region, driven by both input cost inflation and costs and inefficiencies arising from global bottlenecks and shortages, not to mention adverse transactional foreign exchange, and keep in mind that this is net of the good work we're doing on productivity.  Our net sales per kilo, which is how we measure price mix is up in the mid-teens, covering a sizable portion of our input cost inflation. However, it is not able to cover the unpredictable impacts of supply disruptions and the first quarter impacts related to last year's second half fire and strike.  Our net sales per kilo accelerated sequentially in quarter three, in part reflecting revenue growth management actions taken during the quarter. However, our COGS per kilo accelerated too, indicating that these pressures are not behind us.  Slide number 12 shows that our gross profit dollars increased year-on-year, both in quarter three and on a year-to-date basis. During quarter three our margin decline narrowed as we had indicated it would and our net sales grew enough that gross profit dollars increased at a mid-single digit rate year-on-year. So even though our margins have been pressured by the current environment, our gross profit dollars remained on an upward trajectory.  As we look to quarter four, we expect both margins and dollars to increase year-on-year as we lap last year's fire and strike impact. However, based on the current economic conditions, we no longer anticipate bottlenecks and shortages to diminish in quarter four. As a result, while we still expect gross profit margin to increase year-on-year in the quarter, it won't be as much as previously projected. And this will mean finishing the full year with a gross margin that is down a bit more than the 100 basis points previously mentioned, but still growing in dollars.  Moving down the income statement on slide number 13, we see how our SG&A accelerated its year-on-year increase just as we said it would. As expected, advertising and promotion investment increased year-on-year as our U.S. Cereal business resumes commercial activity now that it has got up on inventory. And overhead increased year-on-year, reflecting higher incentive compensation and a resumption of travel and meetings. As we enter quarter four, we expect to see an even larger year-on-year increase in SG&A as North America Cereal, restores more of its commercial activity.  Slide number 14 shows that in spite of these extreme operating conditions, not to mention this year's meaningfully adverse currency translation, we remain on an upward trajectory on operating profit. Operating profit in the third quarter was up 4% year-on-year on a currency neutral basis, and flat after the adverse currency translation. Year-to-date it was up both on currency neutral basis and after adverse foreign exchange. We expect to see that continue in quarter four.  Slide number 15 shows our below the line items which were again collectively negative to EPS growth in the quarter. Interest expense was up modestly year-on-year in quarter three, as lower debt balances were offset by higher interest rates. As we mentioned last quarter, rising interest rates will affect the roughly 20% of our debt that is floating, and this will become much more acute in quarter four.  As expected, other income decreased significantly year-on-year due to the mid-year remeasurement of two of our U.S. Pension plans, which adjust for currently lower asset values and higher interest rates. This will similarly affect other income in quarter four, and as mentioned previously, depending on how financial markets finish this year, this will be an even more significant headwind in 2023 as we'll have a full year impact across all of our post retirement plans. Of course, this is a non-cash, non-operating item.  Our effective tax rate in quarter three was relatively flat year-on-year after benefiting from country mix and discrete benefits. We now look for our full year effective tax rate to be somewhere above 21.5%.  Our JV earnings and minority interests were collectively down against an unusually high year-on-year period following our mid-year '21 consolidation of Africa joint ventures, but remain fairly consistent with more recent quarters, and average shares outstanding were relatively flat year-on-year as the impact of our share buybacks early in the year was offset by increased options exercises by employees. As a result, we now think average shares outstanding will be flattish for the full year.  Our cash flow and balance sheet also remain in very good shape as shown on slide number 16. Our absolute cash flow has remained on an upward trajectory right through quarter three, and this cash flow has enabled us to reduce our net debt over the past few years leading to lower leverage ratios. This has given us enhanced financial flexibility, even as we have continued to increase our cash return to shareowners in the form of an increased dividend and buybacks this year.  Let's now turn to slide number 17 and discuss where we think we'll finish the year. As Steve mentioned, we are raising our guidance today based on our strong quarter three delivery and good top line momentum going into quarter four. We are raising our full year outlook for organic net sales growth to approximately 10%, a sizable increase from our previous guidance of 7% to 8%. This reflects our better than expected performance in quarter three and it implies continued double digit growth in the fourth quarter led by price mix and sustained momentum in our business, partially offset by rising price elasticity and Russia impact.  This improved sales outlook is prompting us to raise our full year outlook for adjusted basis, currency neutral operating profit growth to approximately 6%, up from our previous guidance of 4% to 5%. This is despite sustained high teens cost inflation and our revised assumption around bottlenecks and shortages, which we now expect to persist through the fourth quarter.  We are also raising our full year outlook for adjusted basis earnings per share growth to approximately 3% growth on a currency neutral basis, up from our previous guidance of 2%. This reflects the higher operating profit outlook, partially offset by a worsened outlook for below the line items. This includes our remeasured pension income and higher interest expense due to the rise in rates, only partially offset by an effective tax rate that comes down slightly because of Q3's favorability.  We deliberately stick to currency neutral guidance because of the difficulty in protecting foreign exchange rates. But because of the dollar's meaningful strengthening lately and the number of investor questions we received regarding its impact, I will mention that if today's exchange rates were to hold, we would absorb a negative impact of 3% to 4% on a full year net sales, operating profit and EPS growth, and a higher negative impact in quarter four.  Our full year outlook for cash flow remains approximately $1.2 billion. Remember that this guidance incorporates incremental upfront cash outlays in 2022, related to the previously announced separation transactions.  So to summarize, our financial position on slide number 18, we feel very good about how we are performing and our financial condition. Our business is showing strong underlying momentum. Our efforts around productivity and revenue growth management are helping to mitigate unusually high cost pressures. We are raising our outlook for the full year, largely on the strength of what we've already delivered, and our cash flow and balance sheet are giving us good financial flexibility.  And with that, I'll turn it back to Steve to discuss our individual businesses. Good morning Cody. Yeah, just a couple of other things Cody. So one was, you know we've seen input costs accelerate through the quarter, and I think you know we had talked previously of sequential improvement. We did see the sequential improvement in gross margins, but it was not as much as we expected, and really the primary driver for that was acceleration of input costs, so we saw that happen. We've taken incremental action from a revenue growth management. I think within the quarter there was probably a bit of a lag, so you're seeing the impact of that on margins.  I think as Steve mentioned, bottlenecks and shortages persisted. I think the other factor as well is we resumed as we had said that SG&A would be back and waited. We restored ANP behind cereal as we've built back inventory, so you've seen that come through in the quarter as well. And you know we'd expect that in quarter four as well. So you know the SG&A has been kind of back weighted this year. Good morning. I think from an inflation standpoint, you know we did see meaningful acceleration during the quarter. So we saw input cost inflation at around the 20's, into the 20's, and so I think you know from a full year standpoint and we expect similar levels of inflation in quarter four as well. And I think you know given the acceleration we've seen in quarter three into quarter four, I think our full year inflation, you know from the high teens is now kind of pushing close to the 20% level from an inflation standpoint. I think as always, and as you've seen in our results right, it's a combination of productivity, it's a combination of revenue growth management, and I think as you saw in our quarter three results, our price mix accelerated during the quarter. So I think you know the teams are doing a terrific job navigating through what is a high cost inflation environment by taking instrumental actions as needed.  I would say that on gross margins we saw sequential improvement despite all the inflation, we saw sequential improvement in quarter three, and I think our expectation is that we will see margin improve and gross profit dollars improve in quarter four as we lapped you know the fire and strike. I think from a full year gross margin standpoint, our previous guidance was around 100 basis points declined. You know we'd expect that to be a bit more than the 100 basis points that we had guided to, but I think you know that gives you an indication that despite the higher inflation, you know the amount of incremental actions that the teams have taken, and just the strength of our brands. It was up over 22 \u2013 it was up almost 22% in the year ago quarter Chris. Yep. Yeah, I think you know we've largely been successful right in covering inflation on our input costs and our packaging costs, right, and so I think you know \u2013 I think what, from a disruption standpoint, that's probably and you know some of the unplanned, because of supply chain bottlenecks and some of those inefficiencies are probably the ones that you know it's hard to forecast and hard to plan around that we probably have not been able to pass on. Yeah. So I think you know we'd firstly say, we'd expect a similar amount for quarter four right, so I think that's the first thing. Obviously it depends really on what happens on markets, because the remeasurement would really be at the year end, and where the markets are at the end of the year. What we've seen this year is like I said, it's about on two of our plans. They are roughly around 50% of our value, of our pension assets, and you've seen it for about half a year.  So you know we'd expect a full year impact next year. We need to re-measure all the plans, but, it really depends on where markets are at the end of the year. So it's hard to forecast and we'll obviously talk a lot more about that when we are guiding for \u201823 in our February call. And this is not unique to us. I think it's driven by what's happening in interest rates, as well as markets, and it's of course non-operating and non-cash. Good morning. Yeah, you know the guidance for the quarter four is roughly in line with the year-to-date rate at double digit levels. So it's \u2013 yeah, so it's similar to that. You would see the Russia impact as we saw in quarter three and quarter four as well. So you know as we cycled the stop shipments of Pringles into Russia. And so you know directionally it's in line with the year-to-date.  As always, you know we made some assumptions around rising pricing elasticity. So we'd see how that plays out. I think also from a lab standpoint, quarter four last year was when we took the most revenue growth management actions last year. So we'd be lapping that. So I think you know there are a couple of factors there, but broadly I'd say that the quarter four guide is in line with the year-to-date rates. I think you know we are pleased with the level of spending. I think the phasing and we think we are spending competitively in the marketplace to drive the brands. I think there was some phasing obviously between the first half and the second half, but overall from a full year standpoint right, you know we are pleased with where we are. No cash consequences, really. I mean, you know I think the level of funding, because both your assets and your liabilities go down. So your level of funding is \u2013 you know it moves a little bit, but not meaningfully, so this is really more driven by accounting and like I said, its non-cash, non-operating, and I think the level of funding in the pension plans doesn't change meaningfully."

            "content": "Good morning. Good morning Chris! I think Chris it was more the comp of the prior year. We're really not seeing elasticities in Europe. You know our snacks business led by Pringles is very, very strong. In fact, if you look at \u2013 you know we stopped all shipments into Russia as you know and we quickly diverted all that. You know we were able to sell that volume elsewhere immediately and we're still you know somewhat capacity constrained as the business has been so strong. Virtually all of Europe's volume declined. You bet. Yeah, so Rob I would say you definitely should plan on double digit inflation going into next year and I don't think that's going to be unique to Kellogg. In fact, I know it's not going to be unique to Kellogg.  If you look at spot prices, you know it doesn't always tell the full story. Year-over-year price changes even in spot are still up double digits. You know corn up over 20%, cooking oil is up over 20%, wheat in double digits, you know diesel nearing 50%. You know price, you know this whole inflation was going to be transitory, was always obviously ridiculous, and so we continue to see strong inflation ingredients in Coleman, in packaging, across the board.  So I think as a total country and globe, we need to prepare for the same type of inflation, and this is double digit inflation on top of the inflation we've seen this year. So it's a pretty significant macroeconomic event. Good morning."

At this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for Kellogg Company. Mr. Renwick, you may begin your conference call.\nJohn Renwick: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for a review of our second quarter results and an update on our outlook for 2022. I'm joined this morning by Steve Cahillane, our Chairman and CEO; and Amit Banati, our Chief Financial Officer. Slide 3 shows our forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware, certain statements made today, such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance, are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the third slide of this presentation as well as to our public SEC filings. This is a particular note during the current COVID-19 pandemic, volatile input costs and supply disruptions when the length and severity of these issues and resultant economic and business impacts are so difficult to predict.

And now I'll turn it over to Steve.\nSteven Cahillane: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We are obviously pleased to be able to report yet another quarter of strong performance, one that puts us in a position to raise our outlook for the full year. Before we get into the specific results and guidance, let me emphasize how we are navigating so well through what is undoubtedly a challenging business environment. First, we continue to execute our Deploy for Balanced Growth strategy depicted on Slide 5. As you'll see in the coming slides, it is clearly working. We remain equally committed to our planet and community as evidenced by our strong push in various areas of ESG. Some of our quarter two actions, achievements and recognitions are shown on Slide 6. For a more in-depth look at our ESG work, be on the lookout for our latest annual global ESG report, which will be published next week.  The result of this continued focus on execution is another quarter of strong results, as indicated on Slide 7. As you'll see in a moment, our momentum in snacks remains impressive around the world and led by world-class brands. Our international regions collectively posted yet another quarter of strong growth in sales and profit, a performance that is driven not only by snacks but also Cereal and Noodles & Other in emerging markets.  We also had an exceptional quarter for North America. This was driven not only by snacks but also by cereal. Our North America Cereal business continues to replenish inventory, both ours and net of our customers, leading to gradual resumption of commercial activity and recovery of share. We continue to mitigate the margin pressure created by decades-high cost inflation and bottlenecks and shortages evident across the entire economy. Our productivity initiatives continue to work and our revenue growth management actions continue to be effective.  As a result, we remain on an upward trajectory for operating profit. We're generating strong cash flow, which is providing enhanced financial flexibility, contributing to an increase this year in our dividend and in our share buybacks, all while reducing our net debt year-on-year as well. So we're executing well and delivering ahead of our own financial expectations. And as a result, today, we are raising our full year guidance.  Meanwhile, with June's public kickoff announcement, we continue to progress towards separating our company to 3 stronger, more focused companies as shown on Slide 8. We strongly believe that North America Cereal Co. and Plant Co. will be stronger as separate companies, able to focus on their specific strategies, priorities and resource needs.  Another key precept of our decision was the strength of our remaining Global Snacking Co. business. And our quarter two results only reemphasize that strength. As with any spinoff, this will require organizational design work and carving out the financials of the to-be-separated businesses, which in our structure today are integrated across business units. Work is well underway and we'll keep you apprised of our progress over the next several months. We will also remain laser-focused on delivering on our strategy and financial objectives in the meantime.  So we feel good about our first half of 2022. We feel confident about our second half, and we are excited about our separation plans. Let me now turn it over to Amit, who will explain our financial results and outlook in more detail.\nAmit Banati: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We'll start with a brief summary of our quarter two financial results on Slide 10. Our net sales growth in quarter two again came in better than projected. This was a result of good momentum, particularly in snacks and Noodles & Other as well as price elasticity not returning as quickly to historical levels as we had assumed. It was also driven by North America Cereals recovery happening faster than planned.  Our adjusted basis operating profit grew 10% on a currency-neutral basis in quarter two. This was better than expected and it brings our first half into year-on-year growth. This growth comes despite high cost inflation, industry-wide supply disruptions and incremental costs and lost sales stemming from a fire and strike in our North America Cereal business in the second half of 2021.  Our adjusted basis earnings per share grew a better-than-expected 8% on a currency-neutral basis, bringing our year-to-date growth up to 5%. Cash flow through the first two quarters was ahead of our projections and significantly higher than last year. So clearly, it was a strong quarter, and we entered the second half ahead of where we thought we'd be at this juncture.  Now let's look into each of these metrics in closer detail. Slide 11 lays out the components of our net sales growth this year. On an organic basis, we recorded 12% net sales growth in quarter two. Volume remained pressured in quarter two by bottlenecks and shortages, but the decline was more moderate than expected. Price elasticity did not increase as much as we had anticipated. And our North America Cereal business recovered inventory and shipments faster than expected.  Price/mix remained elevated in quarter two, even accelerating as all 4 regions utilized all levers of revenue growth management in order to complement productivity initiatives. This is all in an effort to protect gross profit dollars amidst enormously high input cost inflation. Through the first half, our net sales grew organically by 8%, with price/mix growth more than offsetting the negative volume impacts of supply disruptions, most notably in North America Cereal and price elasticity.  Foreign currency translation negatively impacted net sales growth by more than 3 percentage points in quarter two as currencies around the globe weakened further against the U.S. dollar. Slide 12 shows the organic basis net sales growth rates of each region during the first 2 quarters of this year. We have generated solid growth in all 4 regions year-to-date, even despite unusual supply disruptions principally in North America. For our international regions, quarter two strong growth was a continuation of a multi-quarter and multi-year trend. And for our North America region, the quarter two growth reflected continued strength in snacks, complemented by better-than-expected recovery in cereal, including trade inventory replenishment.  Overall, for the second half, we expect to see price/mix continue to drive our sales growth, reflecting revenue growth management actions already executed as well as further RGM activity to be taken in the second half. On volume, we are taking the planning stance of assuming a gradual return to normal levels of price elasticity, and additionally, we face a larger impact from lost Russia volume.  Turning now to gross profit. Slide 13 offers a glimpse at just how impactful input cost inflation and supply disruptions have been as well as how each region has utilized revenue growth management to help protect the dollar profit impact. COGS per kilo is a metric that captures the rate of cost across all factors from input cost inflation to adverse transactional foreign exchange to supply disruptions, which create lost absorption and the need to utilize more expensive spot markets.  These metrics also captures productivity savings and changes in mix. As you can see on the chart, this comprehensive cost per kilo was up in the high teens year-on-year in the first half, even after productivity savings. The good news is that our net sales per kilo, which is how we measure price/mix, is up in the low teens, covering a sizable portion of our input cost inflation. However, it's not able to cover the unpredictable impacts of supply disruptions and impacts related to last year's second half fire and strike.  Our objective during this unusually high cost environment is to protect gross profit dollars as much as we can. Slide 14 shows that our gross profit through the first half is down year-on-year, but it wouldn't have been were it not for the fire and strike's residual impact in quarter 1. Moreover, it remains higher than our pre-COVID first half 2019 level with or without the businesses we divested later that year. So even though our margins have been pressured by the current environment, our gross profit dollars remain on an upward trajectory.  As we get into the second half, we no longer have fire and strike impact. In fact, we lap it in quarter 4. Input cost inflation is likely to remain ahead of our productivity and RGM offsets, and we now assume no moderation in bottlenecks and shortages until quarter 4. As a result, we believe we will see gross profit dollars narrow the year-on-year deficit in quarter 3 and then swing to year-on-year growth in quarter 4 when we lap the worst of the fire and strike.  SG&A expense, meanwhile, will work in the opposite direction in the second half. Slide 15 shows how our SG&A began to decline in the second half of 2021 when supply disruptions, starting with bottlenecks and shortages and then worsening with fire and strike forced us to pull back on A&P investment. This was mainly the case in North America Cereal, which continue to refrain from this investment during quarter 1 and only started to resume investment in a relatively small way during quarter two. But you can see how SG&A returned to year-on-year growth in quarter two and should continue to do so in the second half. This will be driven by increased A&P as we restore commercial activity as well as by higher incentive compensation related to our improved outlook and a return to travel and meetings.  Putting it all together, we see on Slide 16 our quarter two and first half operating profit performance in the context of prior years. Leaving aside 2020, which stood out for its pandemic-related lift from shoppers stocking up, our operating profit remains on an upward trajectory. And we grew operating profit year-on-year in quarter two and the first half with and without currency translation. We expect to sustain this upward dollar profit trajectory in the second half as well in spite of cost and supply pressures and increased investment.  Turning now to our below-the-line items on Slide 17. These items were collectively negative to EPS growth in the quarter and only slightly positive for the first half. Interest expense was again down year-on-year in quarter two, owing to lower average debt. However, rising interest rates on the roughly 20% of our debt that is floating will swing interest expense into a year-on-year headwind in the second half.  Other income, which is predominantly the nonoperating portion of pension expense, decreased meaningfully year-on-year in quarter two and the first half, attributable to lower asset values at the beginning of the year. In the second half, an update of higher interest rates and lower pension asset values, reflecting this year's sharply lower fixed income and equity markets will pull down other income in the second half by more than previously forecast. And barring a significant comeback in the financial markets over the remainder of the year, this will be a sizable headwind in 2023 as well.  Our effective tax rate in quarter two was up year-on-year. But through the first half, it was right in line with the approximately 22% rate we expect for the full year. Our JV earnings and minority interest were collectively less negative to net income, thanks to consolidating some of our Africa joint ventures at midyear in 2021. We have now lapped that consolidation so it is no longer a tailwind for this line item.  And average shares outstanding decreased slightly year-on-year, a reflection of our share buybacks during quarter 1. Based on accelerated options exercises and higher stock price, we now expect shares outstanding to decrease less than 0.5% for the full year.  Let's now look at our cash flow, starting with our cash flow conversion ratio shown on Slide 18. In recent years, we've made it a priority to improve our conversion of earnings into cash flow. And while 2020 was distorted by the various effects of the pandemic, you can see that our ratio of cash flow to adjusted basis net income has been on an upward trajectory.  Slide 19 shows what this focus and discipline has done for us. On the left side, you can see that our absolute cash flow has remained on an upward trajectory, and this continued in quarter two. And on the right-hand side, you can see that this cash flow, along with proceeds from our 2019 divestiture, has enabled us to reduce our net debt, leading to lower leverage ratios. This has given us enhanced financial flexibility, even as we have continued to increase our dividend and buy back shares.  Let's now turn to Slide 20 and a discussion about our guidance for the full year. As Steve mentioned, our first half was strong enough and our momentum durable enough that we feel comfortable raising our guidance on all 4 metrics. We are raising our full year outlook for net sales to organic growth of 7% to 8%, a sizable increase from our previous guidance of approximately 4% growth. We are raising our full year outlook for adjusted basis operating profit to 4% to 5% growth on a currency-neutral basis, up significantly from our previous guidance of 1% to 2% growth.  We are raising our full year outlook for adjusted basis earnings per share to approximately 2% growth on a currency-neutral basis, up from our previous guidance of 1% to 2% growth. This is held back only by the pension remeasurement we discussed earlier. This is a nonoperating noncash item. We are raising our full year outlook for cash flow to approximately $1.2 billion, up from our previous guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. This reflects not only a higher cash earnings, but it also incorporates incremental upfront cash outlays in 2022 related to the upcoming separation transactions.  So to summarize on Slide 21, we feel very good about our financial condition as we enter the second half. As Steve mentioned, the work continues towards the separations. As of now, we estimate that we'll incur between $70 million to $80 million in upfront costs in 2022 related to readying for the transactions. To ensure visibility into the ongoing results of the businesses, the company will disclose these upfront costs and exclude them from its adjusted basis operating profit and earnings per share in its external reporting.  However, the cash portion of these costs, which we estimate could be about half of these upfront expenses, are incorporated into our cash flow guidance as always. Meanwhile, we're going to great lengths to ensure no disruption to our business while this work is going on. And we are pleased with the financial health of our businesses. We feel good enough about our business that we can today raise our full year guidance on all key metrics while using our strong cash flow to both return more cash to shareowners and preserve a strong balance sheet. Let me now turn it back to Steve for a review of our regions.\nSteven Cahillane: Thanks, Amit. I'll start with a review of each of our regions, beginning with Kellogg North America on Slide 23. This region had an exceptionally good quarter, posting notably strong net sales growth with growth in both volume and price/mix. And this top line performance drove good growth in operating profit as well. Our sales growth was led by our largest business, snacks, which accelerated because of end market momentum, revenue growth management and replenishment of trade inventory. We obviously feel very good about our snacks business going into the second half. Cereal also posted strong net sales growth in the second quarter, driven both by volume as we replenished both our and retailers' inventories and by price/mix as we executed revenue growth management actions. We feel that our recovery is on firm footing as we enter the second half. And as we get past the fire and strike impact, we are in the early stages of recovering our profit margins in this business as well.  In Frozen, net sales growth in our From the Griddle Eggo business was offset by the decline in our plant-based business, with the latter experiencing supply disruptions at a co-manufacturer. Both businesses are expected to have a better second half, aided by improved capacity and supply. Overall, North America turned in a very good first half, considering its enormous supply obstacles and is poised to sustain top line growth while improving bottom line performance in the second half even as we restore investment.  Kellogg Europe's results are shown on Slide 24. The second quarter was another good one for this region. Revenue growth management actions have sustained good price/mix growth with an extra boost from country and category mix with elasticity impact on volume returning, particularly in cereal but not as quickly as we had anticipated. snacks, which represent almost half of our annual Kellogg Europe net sales, continued to deliver strong growth, both in net sales and in consumption. This has been led by sustained momentum in Pringles but also our portable wholesome snacks brands, which are benefiting from both a resumption in consumer mobility but also from our increased focus on revitalizing these brands.  In cereal, our net sales growth was fairly broad-based across the region, led by effective revenue growth management actions, though with signs of increasing price elasticity in Continental Europe. Going into the second half, we expect to sustain momentum in snacks even as we absorb a larger impact of halting shipments into Russia and working through general supply tightness. And across the business, we'll continue to leverage revenue growth management and productivity to help mitigate the impact of what will be accelerating cost pressures.  Kellogg Latin America, shown on Slide 25, also had a solid quarter two. Its high single-digit net sales growth was driven by price mix and in-market momentum even if we did start to see the rising price elasticity, particularly in cereal. In snacks, which represent more than 1/3 of our annual net sales in Latin America, we continued to drive very strong growth across the region, including share gains in our key markets.  In cereal, net sales grew in most markets and we continued to gain share overall, led by Mexico, Colombia and Brazil. Cost inflation has been higher in our emerging markets than in our developed markets and further exacerbated by adverse transactional foreign exchange. And while this led to margin pressure in Kellogg Latin America, we did see sequential moderation in the second quarter, and this helped drive year-on-year growth in operating profit. In the second half, we expect to sustain sales and profit growth even as we work to offset accelerated cost inflation.  We'll finish our regional review with Kellogg EMEA in Slide 26. During the second quarter, our high teens net organic sales growth was very similar to that of quarter 1 and even the full year of 2021. The growth reflects primarily our revenue growth management actions as we work to protect dollar profit from the highest cost inflation of any region in our company, with ocean freight being a particular driver of this higher cost pressure. This enabled us to continue to post solid operating profit growth in quarter two despite the pressure on margins.  Leading EMEA's growth in quarter two and the first half were Noodles & Other, which make up almost half of the region's annual net sales and which sustained its strong momentum in Africa. Snacks, representing about 1/5 of EMEA's annual net sales, also sustained organic net sales growth of more than 20% with gains across Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Australia driven by momentum in Pringles. In cereal, which generates about 1/3 of our EMEA annual net sales, also posted good broad-based net sales growth with notable strength in Australia, India and the Middle East. For the second half, strong top line and profit growth are expected for this region.  Now let's take a step back and look at Slide 27, which groups our portfolio into the businesses that will comprise each of the 3 post-separation companies. We continue to see strong momentum in the businesses that represent 80% of our portfolio today and that will comprise Global Snacking Co. after the separations. Our snacks businesses around the world continue to show good momentum with organic net sales growth in the double digits during the first half. This double-digit growth is coming from all 4 regions, and it was faster in quarter two than it was in quarter 1. And as we'll see in a moment, this growth is being led by world-class brands.  Noodles & Other, which is predominantly in Africa and the Middle East, continues to post double-digit growth, both in the quarter and the half, aided by higher prices and expanded distribution. International cereal posted low single-digit growth in the first half, led by emerging markets, which make up almost half of our international cereal sales and continue to post good growth in growing categories. And in frozen breakfast, we delivered low single-digit growth despite being constrained on capacity during the quarter.  Putting them all together, the Global Snacking Co. businesses collectively have generated double-digit organic basis net sales growth so far this year. For North America Cereal Co., 2022 is all about recovery of supply, and as we'll discuss in a moment, this recovery is off to a faster-than-expected start. Its lack of inventory pulled down sales sharply in the first quarter but it grew substantially year-on-year in quarter two, bringing its first half net sales performance to a very low single-digit decline.  The only post-spin business where there was softness in quarter two was in Plant Co., which has experienced some supply disruption which we'll discuss in a moment. Let's look at each of these businesses and their key brands. When we turn to Slide 28, we can see that our world-class snacks brands have continued to perform well in market this year around the world. Pringles with $2.5 billion in annual net sales globally remains in an impressive form. It has generated double-digit consumption growth in most of our biggest markets around the world.  Cheez-It with over $1 billion of annual net sales has continued to drive share gains in the cracker category, both in the U.S. and in Canada with our new Pop'd platform off to a strong start and incremental to the core line. Pop-Tarts closing in on $1 billion of annual net sales continues to post good growth in its core U.S. market while showing excellent promise in international markets. The same goes for Rice Krispies Treats with $0.5 billion of annual net sales and double-digit consumption growth in key markets this year. These 4 brands collectively represented more than 40% of the total 2021 net sales of what will be Global Snacking Co. On Slide 29, we see continued strong retail sales growth across key international cereal markets also led by world-class brands. In Europe, the cereal category has slowed, resuming more price elasticity than other regions, and our consumption is lapping a notably strong 2-year period, but we continue to drive good growth in key brands. In emerging markets, which represent about half of our international cereal sales annually, consumption growth remains robust, both for us and the category. We're seeing strong high single-digit consumption growth in Latin America with share gains in key markets like Mexico, Colombia and Brazil. And in EMEA, we're seeing mid-single-digit consumption growth across the region and share gains in markets ranging from Australia to Korea to Saudi Arabia to South Africa.  Slide 30 shows another growth business for us, Noodles & Other. This is comprised of our distributor business in West Africa and our Kellogg's branded noodle business elsewhere in Africa and the Middle East. This is a $1 billion-plus business that has consistently posted double-digit or high single-digit growth quarter after quarter after quarter. This reflects the competitive advantage Multipro offers as well as the value of offering a Kellogg's product line at the lower end of the price pyramid.  Turning to frozen breakfast on Slide 31. Our Eggo brand continues to perform well even despite being constrained on capacity, particularly in waffles and pancakes. The good news is that additional waffles capacity came on stream late in quarter two, and innovation like the more portable style waffle is off to a good start. With about $750 million in annual net sales globally, this is yet another world-class brand and reliable grower that continues to show momentum.  Now let's turn to our U.S. cereal business on Slide 32. As we've discussed, 2022 is all about recovering supply after severe disruptions in late 2021. And as we mentioned earlier, we are ahead of plan in terms of rebuilding inventory, both our own and net of our retail partners. As supply has improved, so have our total distribution points and so has our share. In fact, we've now recovered more than 4 share points since the start of the year. And we have only recently resumed commercial activity and even then, only on certain brands. And this improving trend has continued into July.  On Slide 33, the chart on the left shows how the overall category has accelerated growth lately on the strength of our increased prices and below-average elasticity. It also shows our supply-driven turnaround quite clearly and how we have already begun to catch up on the category. And this trend continued into July. The chart on the right offers a view of how our 5 largest brands are recovering share after hitting lows in the fourth quarter and the aftermath of our fire and strike. These brands have started to resume commercial activity and they are responding immediately.  So we feel good about how our supply is recovering, how we are getting back on shelf and how we are recovering share. We are also poised to begin recovering profit margin. This business is clearly on the rebound.  Moving now to plant-based foods on Slide 34. Our Morningstar Farms is uncharacteristically down in net sales and consumption through the first half. Much of this has to do with supply chain challenges, principally with a co-manufacturer, which led us to reducing our commercial activities. This is a short-term issue and we're working through it. And we have strong plans for the second half as we resume commercial activity. Nevertheless, this is a leader in plant-based foods, a category with tremendous growth prospects. This is a business that remains in good condition from the standpoint of brand equity, marketing and innovation pipeline as well as profitability.  So to close out our prepared remarks, let me briefly summarize with Slide 36. Through the second quarter and the first half, we're very pleased at how the business is performing, particularly given the challenging business environment. We have sustained momentum in the majority of our portfolio. In North America cereal, our recovery is progressing well. We continue to mitigate the pressure on our profit margins. Our cash flow and balance sheet are strong, giving us strong financial flexibility.  We have kicked off the process of separating into 3 companies, and we will not let this distract us from delivering results. And with all this going on, we are raising our outlook for the year. This gives you an idea of just how strong the first half we've had and the kind of confidence we have in our business and all our Kellogg employees that bring their skill and grit to work each and every day. And with that, we'll open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.\nAndrew Lazar: Steve, with the announced spin of North America cereal, one of -- the biggest pushback I think we've continued to hear is really more about the longer-term sustainability of the business as sort of a stand-alone beyond the recovery expected to occur in '22, which is clearly taking shape nicely as you just talked about. So I mean, taking a more forward-looking stance, like on the top line, the question is more about share longer term as I think Kellogg was losing share fairly consistently prior to sort of all of this and prior to the pandemic.  And then on profitability, how do you balance the margin opportunity that you've talked about with the potential need to reinvest more to at least get to a point where you can at least hold share again over the longer term?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Thanks, Andrew. So let me start by just framing the cereal business a little bit in our business for you. We have 5 of the top 11 brands. They are strong brands. All the information, research and data that we have suggests or reinforces how strong these brands are, how relevant they are. The category, as you know right now, is very healthy. It's showing incredible pricing power. Even the last 4 weeks is better than the last 13 weeks. The category is quite healthy. It's versatile. It's showing, especially in challenging times, that it is a very affordable meal for people. A bowl of cereal with a glass of milk is $1, and that's really helping the category. Our recovery, which you already mentioned, is happening faster than planned. We're up 400 basis points year-to-date so the business has good momentum. But your question is, so how do we think about it in the future? And why is it going to be a strong business going forward? And we were losing share prior to the pandemic, and that's well documented. Some of the reasons for that, we went through a pack size harmonization which was necessary, but we did that.  The pandemic obviously had supply-related constraints for everybody. That was a real issue for us. Then we had a fire and strike, and you see the real results of that, and it was very, very difficult but we came through that. This is not a business that has been underinvested, right? But this is a business that will benefit from a focused management team. 1 focus will be -- the only focus will be how to drive these great brands in a category that is showing good recovery. The 1 focus of a new sales force will be these brands with the customers.  There are opportunities for productivity, for sure, for supply chain automation that we're already undergoing right now. And perhaps the best example I can give you, and there's many examples because we've studied these types of spins, where you talk about focus and taking a great collection of brands and focusing them with the management team.  And look at what we've done with Pringles. Pringles, when we took it over was not a brand that was growing. It was not a brand that was able to break through price points. And today, Pringles, you see in virtually all the big markets around the world, is growing double digits, right? So we are very confident in the cereal business going forward for all of these reasons, good category, great brands, focused management team and good examples of where it's worked in the past.\nOperator: The next question is from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.\nSunil Modi: So I guess, Steve, the question is most of us listening on the call have seen a lot of these spins over the last 10, 15, 20 years covering the space. And I think it's pretty safe to say that when these situations are occurring, it's tough, or at least what we've witnessed, it's tough for companies that are going through this process to kind of adjust to a changing environment, whether it be competitive, macro, et cetera.  And we're kind of in this environment now where I would say the volatility, as we can all agree, is probably higher than it's ever been. So I'm just curious. What have you guys observed or learned from prior spins at other companies? What frameworks are you putting in place to make sure that you're able to adjust and adapt to the environment as you go through this process?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Thanks, Nik. So we have studied, as I just mentioned, quite a number of spins. We've got an excellent set of outside advisers that have great experience in this that are working with us. And a number of things I'd say is it's very important to understand who has accountability for what and have the right project teams in place and the right work streams in place to really diligently work through all the work that has to happen.  And perhaps the most important -- it is the most important thing while you're going through this is to keep the focus on the business and the business momentum, and we have great business momentum. And with another thing we've learned is the most successful spins happen from a position of strength, not from a position where you're desperate or things have to happen to fix the business, but when they happen from a real position of strength because then you can unlock the underlying potential of those businesses.  And I think we've got great momentum, obviously a terrific quarter across the board. And so we're doing this from a position of strength. And we've got good accountabilities across the patch. You'll see us making announcements in the coming months about various things related to the spins and keeping that momentum on the existing business and having momentum towards the back half of next year when we'll execute the spins is very important, and we're entirely focused on it.\nSunil Modi: And how close is the organization on figuring out divisional level executives, the C-suites for the independent company?\nSteven Cahillane: So we'll be ready to make those announcements, we said, at the latest in the first quarter of 2023. We might be sooner than that. But when we're ready, we'll make those announcements. We'll make them internally first and then we'll share them with the outside world.\nOperator: The next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.\nKenneth Goldman: First, thank you for the additional detail on the slides on segment-by-segment category growth. That's very helpful. I may have just missed it. Did you guys provide the expected FX impact on the top and bottom lines for the year? Did you update that at all?\nAmit Banati: Yes. So Ken, this is Amit here. So I think during the quarter, we saw strengthening in the dollar against most currencies, particularly the pound and the euro. So in the quarter, in quarter two, we saw an impact of about 3% to 4% across net sales, OP and EPS. Though you've got to remember, this was the toughest comp from -- our toughest quarter from a comp standpoint. I think for the full year, based on exchange rates today, I'd estimate it at around a 3% impact.\nKenneth Goldman: And that's both top and bottom line?\nAmit Banati: Yes.\nKenneth Goldman: Okay. And then my follow-up, I wanted to get a better sense, and I know it's hard just to know these things for sure, but you did guide understandably to other income being less than what you thought previously. I don't think I also heard a specific number there. Do you have any kind of more precise guidance quantitatively that you can provide on that other income line?  And then I'm curious why now for the revaluation when we've already seen asset values fall by the first quarter? Why in the second quarter? Why didn't we see it in the first quarter? Maybe I'm just missing something obvious, but pensions aren't exactly my specialty.\nAmit Banati: Yes. So I think the remeasurement, that was triggered. It was technically triggered because of a number of retirees opting for a lump-sum pension payment. It increased to a point that triggered a remeasurement. So that's the reason why you're seeing why that remeasurement happened. And so I think -- so that's the reason why that happened. I think from a full year standpoint, I think you should see similar year-on-year decline, dollar declines as in the first half despite the comps are easier because we started seeing this trend in the second half of last year. So despite the easier comps, right, you're going to see a similar dollar and dollar declines in the second half as we saw in the first half.  And I think as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this will continue to be a headwind into 2023 where if markets stay where they are right now, obviously, we're going to see significantly lower asset values as we head into '23. So at current market levels, this would be a headwind that would continue into '23.\nOperator: The next question is from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley.\nPamela Kaufman: How much of a benefit did you see in the second quarter from inventory replenishment? And where are retailer inventory levels today? Do you expect to ship ahead of consumption in the third and fourth quarters?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. So in terms of inventory, we did see replenishment of inventory in North America in cereal faster than we anticipated and somewhat in snacks as well, catching up to what had happened last quarter where consumption was ahead of shipments. And so on balance, when you put it all together, there's really kind of nothing to see here, except for the fact that retailer inventories are close to back to where they were in kind of pre-pandemic levels. Service levels are starting to get back to where we want them to be. Still work to be done, but broadly speaking, there's really not much of a story in shipments versus inventory on a year-to-date basis.\nPamela Kaufman: Got it, okay. And maybe if I could sneak 1 more in. Can you provide an updated input cost inflation outlook for the year? Is the recent moderation in commodity prices expected to translate into more moderate inflation next year? Or are there offsets like higher labor cost, supply chain issues that you would expect to keep inflation higher?\nAmit Banati: So we continue to look for gross inflation on input costs to be in the high teens for the full year. In fact, if anything, it's now towards the absolute top end of that range. So incorporated in our guidance is an acceleration -- a continued acceleration in inflation. I think while the spot rates have moved down in some commodities, we are largely hedged for 2022 so we're not going to see any benefit in 2022. It's important also to note that while they move down, the spot rates have moved down, they're significantly higher. They continue to be higher than our averages for this year. And so we'll continue to see and plan for inflation into '23.\nOperator: The next question is from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nStephen Powers: Maybe just back to the U.S. cereal recovery. Clearly, as you've pointed out, you're ahead of schedule, which is great. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is how far ahead of schedule. I guess, maybe in time in terms of like when did you originally expect to be where you are now, if that's an answerable question. And then secondly, as you leverage that momentum, I guess, have your end state objectives or ambitions also changed for the better versus where you were when you started the year?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Thanks, Steve. I guess it's hard to quantify exactly, but I'd say we're about 1/4, so say, 3 months ahead of schedule based on getting inventories where we want them to be and reinstating commercial activity. So as we look at the back half of the year, particularly in quarter 4, we'll be really back to normal in terms of through-the-line execution against all of our brands.  And what you see now, if you look at the syndicated data is the brands that got back to high levels of inventory first are doing the best and are driving the share recovery. And so we don't have a share forecast that -- we don't have 1 for the end of the year but we see good sequential recovery continuing, 400 basis points. So far, we see that continuing and we plan on exiting the year with very, very good momentum.\nStephen Powers: Okay. Maybe less from share perspective, just from what you're seeing in the category. Is the overall category ahead of where you expected it to be, such that, that gives you optimism in terms of where you might end up? Or just anything you can -- any further color and then I'll pass it on.\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Steve, just from a category perspective, the category is doing very, very well. I talked about the affordability of cereal and that's -- and the versatility of it. That's clearly been a driver. If you look at just syndicated data on a year-to-date basis, year-to-date basis, the category is up almost 7%. In the quarter, it was up 9%. The last 4 weeks, it's up double digits. It's up like 15%, I think. And so you're seeing real strength in the category that is above what we expected.  And so obviously, we're playing catch-up already based on what happened with the fire and strike, and we're playing catch-up in a category that's accelerating. So it's really -- it's in a great place. It's better than we expected to be. And clearly, consumers are relying on cereal as their budgets are strapped.\nOperator: The next question is from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.\nRobert Moskow: A couple of questions. One was on modeling. Amit, I thought I heard you say that gross margin dollars would be down year-over-year in third quarter. I think they're up in second quarter. So why would they take a step down in third? And then a follow-up on Morningstar. I thought I also saw an article about a possible labor strike or unionization at one of the plants. Is that at all related to the co-packer problems that you're having? And also, are there any ramifications for the plan to spin off as a stand-alone business?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes, Rob. So I'll take the second question and then let Amit talk about the margins. So it had nothing to do with the labor negotiation that we're talking through right now, has nothing to do with the co-manufacturer. It has nothing to do with the spin or our strategic look at the business. It's entirely what happens often many times, there's a union that has been talking to our workers about a possible unionization effort at our owned Morningstar Farms plant. And obviously, we have a lot of unions in the United States, and we successfully negotiate and renegotiate contracts all the time. The outlier was the cereal strike last year, obviously well documented. We believe that despite having great relations with our unions, we still believe that the best way forward for this particular plant is to remain a nonunion plant and not have somebody in between us and them. It's been a very successful plant. Great wages at the plant, great benefits at the plant. But we'll continue talking and we'll see where we get to. Do you want to take the margin?\nAmit Banati: Yes, I think from a gross margin standpoint, I think maybe I'll start with the full year and then we can get into the quarters. So I think in our last call, we had talked of a projection of a 100 basis point decline year-on-year in gross profit margin. I think sitting here today, we continue to see that range as being where we are from a full year standpoint.  I think in quarter 3, we will see incremental pressure year-on-year. And I think really what's changed is the supply chain bottlenecks, we are continuing to see that. And while it's improved in a couple of areas, broadly, I would say that we continue to see widespread bottlenecks and disruptions. Our previous assumption was that would diminish in quarter 3. I think now, our current planning assumption is that's going to diminish in quarter 4. So quarter 3 would continue to see incremental pressure year-on-year but it will moderate.  And I think our trend from a margin standpoint, the year-on-year decrease in quarter 3 will still continue a trend of sequential moderation in declines, just less than what we had previously expected. And then I think obviously, in quarter four, we start lapping the fire and strike. So we expect our margins -- gross margins to be up year-on-year in quarter four. And overall, for the year, still at that 100 basis point decline that we had talked in our last call.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. So does that mean that gross profit dollars in third quarter, they could still be above year-ago levels even though the percentage is down?\nAmit Banati: Yes, yes. And I think there's a little bit of ForEx impact in that so -- but yes.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler.\nMichael Lavery: I just wanted to come back to the spin and maybe just see if you could touch on the dis-synergies and just give a sense of how much, as you're starting to plan it out, you're able to quantify those and what that looks like. And maybe related to that, for the margin upside you called out as like it was kind of the headline for North America cereal, certainly against current levels that are a little bit depressed, that would make sense. But over time, especially against historical sort of benchmarks with its own stand-alone company costs, how should we expect that to really move the needle?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. So Michael, we're not prepared to talk in detail about models around the 3 different businesses going forward. Suffice it to say though, we are laser-focused on dis-synergies. We're laser-focused on setting up these businesses for success. We understand where businesses have suffered from dis-synergies. And we also understand where businesses have benefited from doing the work required to set these businesses up for success and having the right scale and having the right level of executional focus for the different things that they need to do. So when we're further on in the process, we'll be releasing a lot more information about exactly what the stand-alone businesses will look like on a go-forward basis.\nOperator: The next question is from Cody Ross with UBS.\nCody Ross: Your snacks momentum across the globe is impressive. Can you update us on the progress of expanding some of your brands internationally and how consumers are responding so far? And ultimately, how much room for global expansion do you think there is?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. So thanks, Cody. I think we've got a number of initiatives in place. We've got Cheez-It, which is now in Brazil and Canada and we're looking into Europe as well. We've got plans that we haven't talked about yet, but for some of our other brands like Rice Krispies Treats is an obvious one, and following in the Pringles path, which is obviously all around the world right now.  So we see great opportunity. It's one of the core elements of what we talk about in the Global Snacking business going forward. One of the big opportunities is global expansion of brands like Cheez-It and Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Treats. And so we don't have a lot of detail to share with you yet, but where we have it in Canada and Brazil, it has done very -- I'm talking about Cheez-It, has done exceptionally well ahead of our plan. And so it gives us good confidence that there is great potential there.  In many markets, you'll already find Pop-Tarts, for example, in many markets where it just -- it finds its way there and does very well. So as we build out those plans, it will be part of what [Technical Difficulty].\nAmit Banati: So I'd say most of it was price. And I think without getting into the specifics of prospective pricing, like I said, we continue to plan for an inflationary environment and protect our margins in that environment through a whole suite of revenue growth management actions.\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. And Cody, I would just add, always working on productivity as our first line of defense. But obviously, in an environment like this, productivity, it's very difficult to approach the type of inflationary levels we're seeing but always working with our retail partners as constructively, as collaboratively as we can to keep prices affordable and keep the consumer at the heart and soul of everything that we do.\nCody Ross: And just remind us, how much productivity typically are you planning for this year?\nAmit Banati: It's in the -- it's -- normally, we'd operate at around 4% range, 3% to 4% range. But I mean, this year with the bottlenecks, it's probably a little lower than the -- than what's normal, but in that ballpark.\nOperator: The next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: One quick question back on the pension. I think you mentioned that the negative revision to the other income was due predominantly to returns, with what's happened in fixed income and equity markets. When you went through and did the remeasurement, did you also address discount rates or is that something you're going to do at your end based on where we sit today? What do you expect impact to have?\nAmit Banati: We did, Jason. So I think it's both. I think there are two impacts that come through, right? One is a low asset base creates a lower expected return on assets, right? So the rate on -- the expected return on assets is unchanged but it's just on a lower asset base, so that generates a lower pension income.  I think the other thing that we've done is we've updated the interest charge that flows through the P&L on your liabilities. So while your liabilities have gone down with a higher discount rate, the charge that you take for the year has gone up because of the higher interest cost. So we've done both, and both of those are reflected in our outlook.\nJason English: Got it. Good to hear. And I'm going to come back and probably bang my head into the wall with limited success on Michael's question around stranded cost because it's really top of mind amongst every investor we talk to. When you spun out Keebler, I think the stranded cost equated to something a little north of 10% of Keebler sales. Is there any reason to believe that, that's not a fair number to work with as we think about what Global Snack Co. could be saddled with as you spin out North America and Plant Co.?\nAmit Banati: Yes. I think if you look at Keebler, right, in the end, and if you look at our '21 results and you look at where our overheads are, I think the teams and the organization did a terrific job working through the stranded costs. And so I think as you look back on our results, we worked those stranded costs through the system, and there was a lot of work to make that happen. So as we embark on this spin, I think we're very mindful of the challenge.  No question, our businesses are well integrated. And so as we -- and there are entanglements. But I think to the point that Steve was making, as we work on the separation, we are very mindful as well of stranded costs and program and having the necessary programs in place to address them over time.\nJohn Renwick: Operator, I think we have time for just 1 more question.\nOperator: And the question will come from Chris Growe with Stifel.\nChristopher Growe: I just had a quick question, just to follow up on an earlier question from Cody. I believe it was on, does just -- and this is just based on the pricing you've announced so far. Does pricing accelerate in 3Q versus 2Q? Not asking for prospective pricing, just what you've announced so far.\nSteven Cahillane: I wouldn't say it accelerates, Chris. It's quite high right now. And so I'd say you're going to see the same type of end market that you're seeing right now.\nAmit Banati: And the only thing I'd add is we've had multiple rounds of pricing around the world. And so I think we've been reacting to what we are seeing on commodities and input costs. As Steve said, we've got productivity programs in place so we've been through multiple rounds.\nChristopher Growe: I get it. And you're starting to lap -- this stuff started happened a year ago so I get there's a lot of year-over-year comparison factors. I just wanted to understand that a little better.  And then there was a comment on my -- just my last point or question would be on price elasticity in cereal in Europe. The comment you made, you're seeing, I think, in the continent. Is that getting back to like historical levels? Is that a rate that you would generally expect to kind of creep into the U.S. and other divisions based on your second half expectation for elasticity to pick back up? And I can leave it there.\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Chris, I'd say in Continental Europe, it's not back to historical levels but it's gradually approaching that. And it's unique to the continent. It's not in the U.K., nowhere near that in the United States. And so Continental Europe has obviously always been a different market. It's seeing inflation. And it never sees inflation. It's used to deflation. So I'd say it's not a good indicator of what might happen around the world, but it is happening in the continent, in Continental Europe, but principally Germany, Italy and Spain.\nJohn Renwick: And with that, we're going to -- we're at time. Steve, any last comments or thoughts?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. I would just say thanks again for your interest. Thanks for your time. We certainly appreciate it. We're proud of the work that was done this quarter, the momentum that we have. And I'll close it out by thanking all of our associates around the world who made this happen. We really appreciate all of their efforts and wish you a very good day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Steven Cahillane",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We are obviously pleased to be able to report yet another quarter of strong performance, one that puts us in a position to raise our outlook for the full year. Before we get into the specific results and guidance, let me emphasize how we are navigating so well through what is undoubtedly a challenging business environment. First, we continue to execute our Deploy for Balanced Growth strategy depicted on Slide 5. As you'll see in the coming slides, it is clearly working. We remain equally committed to our planet and community as evidenced by our strong push in various areas of ESG. Some of our quarter two actions, achievements and recognitions are shown on Slide 6. For a more in-depth look at our ESG work, be on the lookout for our latest annual global ESG report, which will be published next week.  The result of this continued focus on execution is another quarter of strong results, as indicated on Slide 7. As you'll see in a moment, our momentum in snacks remains impressive around the world and led by world-class brands. Our international regions collectively posted yet another quarter of strong growth in sales and profit, a performance that is driven not only by snacks but also Cereal and Noodles & Other in emerging markets.  We also had an exceptional quarter for North America. This was driven not only by snacks but also by cereal. Our North America Cereal business continues to replenish inventory, both ours and net of our customers, leading to gradual resumption of commercial activity and recovery of share. We continue to mitigate the margin pressure created by decades-high cost inflation and bottlenecks and shortages evident across the entire economy. Our productivity initiatives continue to work and our revenue growth management actions continue to be effective.  As a result, we remain on an upward trajectory for operating profit. We're generating strong cash flow, which is providing enhanced financial flexibility, contributing to an increase this year in our dividend and in our share buybacks, all while reducing our net debt year-on-year as well. So we're executing well and delivering ahead of our own financial expectations. And as a result, today, we are raising our full year guidance.  Meanwhile, with June's public kickoff announcement, we continue to progress towards separating our company to 3 stronger, more focused companies as shown on Slide 8. We strongly believe that North America Cereal Co. and Plant Co. will be stronger as separate companies, able to focus on their specific strategies, priorities and resource needs.  Another key precept of our decision was the strength of our remaining Global Snacking Co. business. And our quarter two results only reemphasize that strength. As with any spinoff, this will require organizational design work and carving out the financials of the to-be-separated businesses, which in our structure today are integrated across business units. Work is well underway and we'll keep you apprised of our progress over the next several months. We will also remain laser-focused on delivering on our strategy and financial objectives in the meantime.  So we feel good about our first half of 2022. We feel confident about our second half, and we are excited about our separation plans. Let me now turn it over to Amit, who will explain our financial results and outlook in more detail. Thanks, Amit. I'll start with a review of each of our regions, beginning with Kellogg North America on Slide 23. This region had an exceptionally good quarter, posting notably strong net sales growth with growth in both volume and price/mix. And this top line performance drove good growth in operating profit as well. Our sales growth was led by our largest business, snacks, which accelerated because of end market momentum, revenue growth management and replenishment of trade inventory. We obviously feel very good about our snacks business going into the second half. Cereal also posted strong net sales growth in the second quarter, driven both by volume as we replenished both our and retailers' inventories and by price/mix as we executed revenue growth management actions. We feel that our recovery is on firm footing as we enter the second half. And as we get past the fire and strike impact, we are in the early stages of recovering our profit margins in this business as well.  In Frozen, net sales growth in our From the Griddle Eggo business was offset by the decline in our plant-based business, with the latter experiencing supply disruptions at a co-manufacturer. Both businesses are expected to have a better second half, aided by improved capacity and supply. Overall, North America turned in a very good first half, considering its enormous supply obstacles and is poised to sustain top line growth while improving bottom line performance in the second half even as we restore investment.  Kellogg Europe's results are shown on Slide 24. The second quarter was another good one for this region. Revenue growth management actions have sustained good price/mix growth with an extra boost from country and category mix with elasticity impact on volume returning, particularly in cereal but not as quickly as we had anticipated. snacks, which represent almost half of our annual Kellogg Europe net sales, continued to deliver strong growth, both in net sales and in consumption. This has been led by sustained momentum in Pringles but also our portable wholesome snacks brands, which are benefiting from both a resumption in consumer mobility but also from our increased focus on revitalizing these brands.  In cereal, our net sales growth was fairly broad-based across the region, led by effective revenue growth management actions, though with signs of increasing price elasticity in Continental Europe. Going into the second half, we expect to sustain momentum in snacks even as we absorb a larger impact of halting shipments into Russia and working through general supply tightness. And across the business, we'll continue to leverage revenue growth management and productivity to help mitigate the impact of what will be accelerating cost pressures.  Kellogg Latin America, shown on Slide 25, also had a solid quarter two. Its high single-digit net sales growth was driven by price mix and in-market momentum even if we did start to see the rising price elasticity, particularly in cereal. In snacks, which represent more than 1/3 of our annual net sales in Latin America, we continued to drive very strong growth across the region, including share gains in our key markets.  In cereal, net sales grew in most markets and we continued to gain share overall, led by Mexico, Colombia and Brazil. Cost inflation has been higher in our emerging markets than in our developed markets and further exacerbated by adverse transactional foreign exchange. And while this led to margin pressure in Kellogg Latin America, we did see sequential moderation in the second quarter, and this helped drive year-on-year growth in operating profit. In the second half, we expect to sustain sales and profit growth even as we work to offset accelerated cost inflation.  We'll finish our regional review with Kellogg EMEA in Slide 26. During the second quarter, our high teens net organic sales growth was very similar to that of quarter 1 and even the full year of 2021. The growth reflects primarily our revenue growth management actions as we work to protect dollar profit from the highest cost inflation of any region in our company, with ocean freight being a particular driver of this higher cost pressure. This enabled us to continue to post solid operating profit growth in quarter two despite the pressure on margins.  Leading EMEA's growth in quarter two and the first half were Noodles & Other, which make up almost half of the region's annual net sales and which sustained its strong momentum in Africa. Snacks, representing about 1/5 of EMEA's annual net sales, also sustained organic net sales growth of more than 20% with gains across Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Australia driven by momentum in Pringles. In cereal, which generates about 1/3 of our EMEA annual net sales, also posted good broad-based net sales growth with notable strength in Australia, India and the Middle East. For the second half, strong top line and profit growth are expected for this region.  Now let's take a step back and look at Slide 27, which groups our portfolio into the businesses that will comprise each of the 3 post-separation companies. We continue to see strong momentum in the businesses that represent 80% of our portfolio today and that will comprise Global Snacking Co. after the separations. Our snacks businesses around the world continue to show good momentum with organic net sales growth in the double digits during the first half. This double-digit growth is coming from all 4 regions, and it was faster in quarter two than it was in quarter 1. And as we'll see in a moment, this growth is being led by world-class brands.  Noodles & Other, which is predominantly in Africa and the Middle East, continues to post double-digit growth, both in the quarter and the half, aided by higher prices and expanded distribution. International cereal posted low single-digit growth in the first half, led by emerging markets, which make up almost half of our international cereal sales and continue to post good growth in growing categories. And in frozen breakfast, we delivered low single-digit growth despite being constrained on capacity during the quarter.  Putting them all together, the Global Snacking Co. businesses collectively have generated double-digit organic basis net sales growth so far this year. For North America Cereal Co., 2022 is all about recovery of supply, and as we'll discuss in a moment, this recovery is off to a faster-than-expected start. Its lack of inventory pulled down sales sharply in the first quarter but it grew substantially year-on-year in quarter two, bringing its first half net sales performance to a very low single-digit decline.  The only post-spin business where there was softness in quarter two was in Plant Co., which has experienced some supply disruption which we'll discuss in a moment. Let's look at each of these businesses and their key brands. When we turn to Slide 28, we can see that our world-class snacks brands have continued to perform well in market this year around the world. Pringles with $2.5 billion in annual net sales globally remains in an impressive form. It has generated double-digit consumption growth in most of our biggest markets around the world.  Cheez-It with over $1 billion of annual net sales has continued to drive share gains in the cracker category, both in the U.S. and in Canada with our new Pop'd platform off to a strong start and incremental to the core line. Pop-Tarts closing in on $1 billion of annual net sales continues to post good growth in its core U.S. market while showing excellent promise in international markets. The same goes for Rice Krispies Treats with $0.5 billion of annual net sales and double-digit consumption growth in key markets this year. These 4 brands collectively represented more than 40% of the total 2021 net sales of what will be Global Snacking Co. On Slide 29, we see continued strong retail sales growth across key international cereal markets also led by world-class brands. In Europe, the cereal category has slowed, resuming more price elasticity than other regions, and our consumption is lapping a notably strong 2-year period, but we continue to drive good growth in key brands. In emerging markets, which represent about half of our international cereal sales annually, consumption growth remains robust, both for us and the category. We're seeing strong high single-digit consumption growth in Latin America with share gains in key markets like Mexico, Colombia and Brazil. And in EMEA, we're seeing mid-single-digit consumption growth across the region and share gains in markets ranging from Australia to Korea to Saudi Arabia to South Africa.  Slide 30 shows another growth business for us, Noodles & Other. This is comprised of our distributor business in West Africa and our Kellogg's branded noodle business elsewhere in Africa and the Middle East. This is a $1 billion-plus business that has consistently posted double-digit or high single-digit growth quarter after quarter after quarter. This reflects the competitive advantage Multipro offers as well as the value of offering a Kellogg's product line at the lower end of the price pyramid.  Turning to frozen breakfast on Slide 31. Our Eggo brand continues to perform well even despite being constrained on capacity, particularly in waffles and pancakes. The good news is that additional waffles capacity came on stream late in quarter two, and innovation like the more portable style waffle is off to a good start. With about $750 million in annual net sales globally, this is yet another world-class brand and reliable grower that continues to show momentum.  Now let's turn to our U.S. cereal business on Slide 32. As we've discussed, 2022 is all about recovering supply after severe disruptions in late 2021. And as we mentioned earlier, we are ahead of plan in terms of rebuilding inventory, both our own and net of our retail partners. As supply has improved, so have our total distribution points and so has our share. In fact, we've now recovered more than 4 share points since the start of the year. And we have only recently resumed commercial activity and even then, only on certain brands. And this improving trend has continued into July.  On Slide 33, the chart on the left shows how the overall category has accelerated growth lately on the strength of our increased prices and below-average elasticity. It also shows our supply-driven turnaround quite clearly and how we have already begun to catch up on the category. And this trend continued into July. The chart on the right offers a view of how our 5 largest brands are recovering share after hitting lows in the fourth quarter and the aftermath of our fire and strike. These brands have started to resume commercial activity and they are responding immediately.  So we feel good about how our supply is recovering, how we are getting back on shelf and how we are recovering share. We are also poised to begin recovering profit margin. This business is clearly on the rebound.  Moving now to plant-based foods on Slide 34. Our Morningstar Farms is uncharacteristically down in net sales and consumption through the first half. Much of this has to do with supply chain challenges, principally with a co-manufacturer, which led us to reducing our commercial activities. This is a short-term issue and we're working through it. And we have strong plans for the second half as we resume commercial activity. Nevertheless, this is a leader in plant-based foods, a category with tremendous growth prospects. This is a business that remains in good condition from the standpoint of brand equity, marketing and innovation pipeline as well as profitability.  So to close out our prepared remarks, let me briefly summarize with Slide 36. Through the second quarter and the first half, we're very pleased at how the business is performing, particularly given the challenging business environment. We have sustained momentum in the majority of our portfolio. In North America cereal, our recovery is progressing well. We continue to mitigate the pressure on our profit margins. Our cash flow and balance sheet are strong, giving us strong financial flexibility.  We have kicked off the process of separating into 3 companies, and we will not let this distract us from delivering results. And with all this going on, we are raising our outlook for the year. This gives you an idea of just how strong the first half we've had and the kind of confidence we have in our business and all our Kellogg employees that bring their skill and grit to work each and every day. And with that, we'll open up the line for questions. Yes. Thanks, Andrew. So let me start by just framing the cereal business a little bit in our business for you. We have 5 of the top 11 brands. They are strong brands. All the information, research and data that we have suggests or reinforces how strong these brands are, how relevant they are. The category, as you know right now, is very healthy. It's showing incredible pricing power. Even the last 4 weeks is better than the last 13 weeks. The category is quite healthy. It's versatile. It's showing, especially in challenging times, that it is a very affordable meal for people. A bowl of cereal with a glass of milk is $1, and that's really helping the category. Our recovery, which you already mentioned, is happening faster than planned. We're up 400 basis points year-to-date so the business has good momentum. But your question is, so how do we think about it in the future? And why is it going to be a strong business going forward? And we were losing share prior to the pandemic, and that's well documented. Some of the reasons for that, we went through a pack size harmonization which was necessary, but we did that.  The pandemic obviously had supply-related constraints for everybody. That was a real issue for us. Then we had a fire and strike, and you see the real results of that, and it was very, very difficult but we came through that. This is not a business that has been underinvested, right? But this is a business that will benefit from a focused management team. 1 focus will be -- the only focus will be how to drive these great brands in a category that is showing good recovery. The 1 focus of a new sales force will be these brands with the customers.  There are opportunities for productivity, for sure, for supply chain automation that we're already undergoing right now. And perhaps the best example I can give you, and there's many examples because we've studied these types of spins, where you talk about focus and taking a great collection of brands and focusing them with the management team.  And look at what we've done with Pringles. Pringles, when we took it over was not a brand that was growing. It was not a brand that was able to break through price points. And today, Pringles, you see in virtually all the big markets around the world, is growing double digits, right? So we are very confident in the cereal business going forward for all of these reasons, good category, great brands, focused management team and good examples of where it's worked in the past. Yes. Thanks, Nik. So we have studied, as I just mentioned, quite a number of spins. We've got an excellent set of outside advisers that have great experience in this that are working with us. And a number of things I'd say is it's very important to understand who has accountability for what and have the right project teams in place and the right work streams in place to really diligently work through all the work that has to happen.  And perhaps the most important -- it is the most important thing while you're going through this is to keep the focus on the business and the business momentum, and we have great business momentum. And with another thing we've learned is the most successful spins happen from a position of strength, not from a position where you're desperate or things have to happen to fix the business, but when they happen from a real position of strength because then you can unlock the underlying potential of those businesses.  And I think we've got great momentum, obviously a terrific quarter across the board. And so we're doing this from a position of strength. And we've got good accountabilities across the patch. You'll see us making announcements in the coming months about various things related to the spins and keeping that momentum on the existing business and having momentum towards the back half of next year when we'll execute the spins is very important, and we're entirely focused on it. So we'll be ready to make those announcements, we said, at the latest in the first quarter of 2023. We might be sooner than that. But when we're ready, we'll make those announcements. We'll make them internally first and then we'll share them with the outside world. Yes. So in terms of inventory, we did see replenishment of inventory in North America in cereal faster than we anticipated and somewhat in snacks as well, catching up to what had happened last quarter where consumption was ahead of shipments. And so on balance, when you put it all together, there's really kind of nothing to see here, except for the fact that retailer inventories are close to back to where they were in kind of pre-pandemic levels. Service levels are starting to get back to where we want them to be. Still work to be done, but broadly speaking, there's really not much of a story in shipments versus inventory on a year-to-date basis. Yes. Thanks, Steve. I guess it's hard to quantify exactly, but I'd say we're about 1/4, so say, 3 months ahead of schedule based on getting inventories where we want them to be and reinstating commercial activity. So as we look at the back half of the year, particularly in quarter 4, we'll be really back to normal in terms of through-the-line execution against all of our brands.  And what you see now, if you look at the syndicated data is the brands that got back to high levels of inventory first are doing the best and are driving the share recovery. And so we don't have a share forecast that -- we don't have 1 for the end of the year but we see good sequential recovery continuing, 400 basis points. So far, we see that continuing and we plan on exiting the year with very, very good momentum. Yes. Steve, just from a category perspective, the category is doing very, very well. I talked about the affordability of cereal and that's -- and the versatility of it. That's clearly been a driver. If you look at just syndicated data on a year-to-date basis, year-to-date basis, the category is up almost 7%. In the quarter, it was up 9%. The last 4 weeks, it's up double digits. It's up like 15%, I think. And so you're seeing real strength in the category that is above what we expected.  And so obviously, we're playing catch-up already based on what happened with the fire and strike, and we're playing catch-up in a category that's accelerating. So it's really -- it's in a great place. It's better than we expected to be. And clearly, consumers are relying on cereal as their budgets are strapped. Yes, Rob. So I'll take the second question and then let Amit talk about the margins. So it had nothing to do with the labor negotiation that we're talking through right now, has nothing to do with the co-manufacturer. It has nothing to do with the spin or our strategic look at the business. It's entirely what happens often many times, there's a union that has been talking to our workers about a possible unionization effort at our owned Morningstar Farms plant. And obviously, we have a lot of unions in the United States, and we successfully negotiate and renegotiate contracts all the time. The outlier was the cereal strike last year, obviously well documented. We believe that despite having great relations with our unions, we still believe that the best way forward for this particular plant is to remain a nonunion plant and not have somebody in between us and them. It's been a very successful plant. Great wages at the plant, great benefits at the plant. But we'll continue talking and we'll see where we get to. Do you want to take the margin? Yes. So Michael, we're not prepared to talk in detail about models around the 3 different businesses going forward. Suffice it to say though, we are laser-focused on dis-synergies. We're laser-focused on setting up these businesses for success. We understand where businesses have suffered from dis-synergies. And we also understand where businesses have benefited from doing the work required to set these businesses up for success and having the right scale and having the right level of executional focus for the different things that they need to do. So when we're further on in the process, we'll be releasing a lot more information about exactly what the stand-alone businesses will look like on a go-forward basis. Yes. So thanks, Cody. I think we've got a number of initiatives in place. We've got Cheez-It, which is now in Brazil and Canada and we're looking into Europe as well. We've got plans that we haven't talked about yet, but for some of our other brands like Rice Krispies Treats is an obvious one, and following in the Pringles path, which is obviously all around the world right now.  So we see great opportunity. It's one of the core elements of what we talk about in the Global Snacking business going forward. One of the big opportunities is global expansion of brands like Cheez-It and Pop-Tarts and Rice Krispies Treats. And so we don't have a lot of detail to share with you yet, but where we have it in Canada and Brazil, it has done very -- I'm talking about Cheez-It, has done exceptionally well ahead of our plan. And so it gives us good confidence that there is great potential there.  In many markets, you'll already find Pop-Tarts, for example, in many markets where it just -- it finds its way there and does very well. So as we build out those plans, it will be part of what [Technical Difficulty]. Yes. And Cody, I would just add, always working on productivity as our first line of defense. But obviously, in an environment like this, productivity, it's very difficult to approach the type of inflationary levels we're seeing but always working with our retail partners as constructively, as collaboratively as we can to keep prices affordable and keep the consumer at the heart and soul of everything that we do. I wouldn't say it accelerates, Chris. It's quite high right now. And so I'd say you're going to see the same type of end market that you're seeing right now. Yes. Chris, I'd say in Continental Europe, it's not back to historical levels but it's gradually approaching that. And it's unique to the continent. It's not in the U.K., nowhere near that in the United States. And so Continental Europe has obviously always been a different market. It's seeing inflation. And it never sees inflation. It's used to deflation. So I'd say it's not a good indicator of what might happen around the world, but it is happening in the continent, in Continental Europe, but principally Germany, Italy and Spain. Yes. I would just say thanks again for your interest. Thanks for your time. We certainly appreciate it. We're proud of the work that was done this quarter, the momentum that we have. And I'll close it out by thanking all of our associates around the world who made this happen. We really appreciate all of their efforts and wish you a very good day."

            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We'll start with a brief summary of our quarter two financial results on Slide 10. Our net sales growth in quarter two again came in better than projected. This was a result of good momentum, particularly in snacks and Noodles & Other as well as price elasticity not returning as quickly to historical levels as we had assumed. It was also driven by North America Cereals recovery happening faster than planned.  Our adjusted basis operating profit grew 10% on a currency-neutral basis in quarter two. This was better than expected and it brings our first half into year-on-year growth. This growth comes despite high cost inflation, industry-wide supply disruptions and incremental costs and lost sales stemming from a fire and strike in our North America Cereal business in the second half of 2021.  Our adjusted basis earnings per share grew a better-than-expected 8% on a currency-neutral basis, bringing our year-to-date growth up to 5%. Cash flow through the first two quarters was ahead of our projections and significantly higher than last year. So clearly, it was a strong quarter, and we entered the second half ahead of where we thought we'd be at this juncture.  Now let's look into each of these metrics in closer detail. Slide 11 lays out the components of our net sales growth this year. On an organic basis, we recorded 12% net sales growth in quarter two. Volume remained pressured in quarter two by bottlenecks and shortages, but the decline was more moderate than expected. Price elasticity did not increase as much as we had anticipated. And our North America Cereal business recovered inventory and shipments faster than expected.  Price/mix remained elevated in quarter two, even accelerating as all 4 regions utilized all levers of revenue growth management in order to complement productivity initiatives. This is all in an effort to protect gross profit dollars amidst enormously high input cost inflation. Through the first half, our net sales grew organically by 8%, with price/mix growth more than offsetting the negative volume impacts of supply disruptions, most notably in North America Cereal and price elasticity.  Foreign currency translation negatively impacted net sales growth by more than 3 percentage points in quarter two as currencies around the globe weakened further against the U.S. dollar. Slide 12 shows the organic basis net sales growth rates of each region during the first 2 quarters of this year. We have generated solid growth in all 4 regions year-to-date, even despite unusual supply disruptions principally in North America. For our international regions, quarter two strong growth was a continuation of a multi-quarter and multi-year trend. And for our North America region, the quarter two growth reflected continued strength in snacks, complemented by better-than-expected recovery in cereal, including trade inventory replenishment.  Overall, for the second half, we expect to see price/mix continue to drive our sales growth, reflecting revenue growth management actions already executed as well as further RGM activity to be taken in the second half. On volume, we are taking the planning stance of assuming a gradual return to normal levels of price elasticity, and additionally, we face a larger impact from lost Russia volume.  Turning now to gross profit. Slide 13 offers a glimpse at just how impactful input cost inflation and supply disruptions have been as well as how each region has utilized revenue growth management to help protect the dollar profit impact. COGS per kilo is a metric that captures the rate of cost across all factors from input cost inflation to adverse transactional foreign exchange to supply disruptions, which create lost absorption and the need to utilize more expensive spot markets.  These metrics also captures productivity savings and changes in mix. As you can see on the chart, this comprehensive cost per kilo was up in the high teens year-on-year in the first half, even after productivity savings. The good news is that our net sales per kilo, which is how we measure price/mix, is up in the low teens, covering a sizable portion of our input cost inflation. However, it's not able to cover the unpredictable impacts of supply disruptions and impacts related to last year's second half fire and strike.  Our objective during this unusually high cost environment is to protect gross profit dollars as much as we can. Slide 14 shows that our gross profit through the first half is down year-on-year, but it wouldn't have been were it not for the fire and strike's residual impact in quarter 1. Moreover, it remains higher than our pre-COVID first half 2019 level with or without the businesses we divested later that year. So even though our margins have been pressured by the current environment, our gross profit dollars remain on an upward trajectory.  As we get into the second half, we no longer have fire and strike impact. In fact, we lap it in quarter 4. Input cost inflation is likely to remain ahead of our productivity and RGM offsets, and we now assume no moderation in bottlenecks and shortages until quarter 4. As a result, we believe we will see gross profit dollars narrow the year-on-year deficit in quarter 3 and then swing to year-on-year growth in quarter 4 when we lap the worst of the fire and strike.  SG&A expense, meanwhile, will work in the opposite direction in the second half. Slide 15 shows how our SG&A began to decline in the second half of 2021 when supply disruptions, starting with bottlenecks and shortages and then worsening with fire and strike forced us to pull back on A&P investment. This was mainly the case in North America Cereal, which continue to refrain from this investment during quarter 1 and only started to resume investment in a relatively small way during quarter two. But you can see how SG&A returned to year-on-year growth in quarter two and should continue to do so in the second half. This will be driven by increased A&P as we restore commercial activity as well as by higher incentive compensation related to our improved outlook and a return to travel and meetings.  Putting it all together, we see on Slide 16 our quarter two and first half operating profit performance in the context of prior years. Leaving aside 2020, which stood out for its pandemic-related lift from shoppers stocking up, our operating profit remains on an upward trajectory. And we grew operating profit year-on-year in quarter two and the first half with and without currency translation. We expect to sustain this upward dollar profit trajectory in the second half as well in spite of cost and supply pressures and increased investment.  Turning now to our below-the-line items on Slide 17. These items were collectively negative to EPS growth in the quarter and only slightly positive for the first half. Interest expense was again down year-on-year in quarter two, owing to lower average debt. However, rising interest rates on the roughly 20% of our debt that is floating will swing interest expense into a year-on-year headwind in the second half.  Other income, which is predominantly the nonoperating portion of pension expense, decreased meaningfully year-on-year in quarter two and the first half, attributable to lower asset values at the beginning of the year. In the second half, an update of higher interest rates and lower pension asset values, reflecting this year's sharply lower fixed income and equity markets will pull down other income in the second half by more than previously forecast. And barring a significant comeback in the financial markets over the remainder of the year, this will be a sizable headwind in 2023 as well.  Our effective tax rate in quarter two was up year-on-year. But through the first half, it was right in line with the approximately 22% rate we expect for the full year. Our JV earnings and minority interest were collectively less negative to net income, thanks to consolidating some of our Africa joint ventures at midyear in 2021. We have now lapped that consolidation so it is no longer a tailwind for this line item.  And average shares outstanding decreased slightly year-on-year, a reflection of our share buybacks during quarter 1. Based on accelerated options exercises and higher stock price, we now expect shares outstanding to decrease less than 0.5% for the full year.  Let's now look at our cash flow, starting with our cash flow conversion ratio shown on Slide 18. In recent years, we've made it a priority to improve our conversion of earnings into cash flow. And while 2020 was distorted by the various effects of the pandemic, you can see that our ratio of cash flow to adjusted basis net income has been on an upward trajectory.  Slide 19 shows what this focus and discipline has done for us. On the left side, you can see that our absolute cash flow has remained on an upward trajectory, and this continued in quarter two. And on the right-hand side, you can see that this cash flow, along with proceeds from our 2019 divestiture, has enabled us to reduce our net debt, leading to lower leverage ratios. This has given us enhanced financial flexibility, even as we have continued to increase our dividend and buy back shares.  Let's now turn to Slide 20 and a discussion about our guidance for the full year. As Steve mentioned, our first half was strong enough and our momentum durable enough that we feel comfortable raising our guidance on all 4 metrics. We are raising our full year outlook for net sales to organic growth of 7% to 8%, a sizable increase from our previous guidance of approximately 4% growth. We are raising our full year outlook for adjusted basis operating profit to 4% to 5% growth on a currency-neutral basis, up significantly from our previous guidance of 1% to 2% growth.  We are raising our full year outlook for adjusted basis earnings per share to approximately 2% growth on a currency-neutral basis, up from our previous guidance of 1% to 2% growth. This is held back only by the pension remeasurement we discussed earlier. This is a nonoperating noncash item. We are raising our full year outlook for cash flow to approximately $1.2 billion, up from our previous guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. This reflects not only a higher cash earnings, but it also incorporates incremental upfront cash outlays in 2022 related to the upcoming separation transactions.  So to summarize on Slide 21, we feel very good about our financial condition as we enter the second half. As Steve mentioned, the work continues towards the separations. As of now, we estimate that we'll incur between $70 million to $80 million in upfront costs in 2022 related to readying for the transactions. To ensure visibility into the ongoing results of the businesses, the company will disclose these upfront costs and exclude them from its adjusted basis operating profit and earnings per share in its external reporting.  However, the cash portion of these costs, which we estimate could be about half of these upfront expenses, are incorporated into our cash flow guidance as always. Meanwhile, we're going to great lengths to ensure no disruption to our business while this work is going on. And we are pleased with the financial health of our businesses. We feel good enough about our business that we can today raise our full year guidance on all key metrics while using our strong cash flow to both return more cash to shareowners and preserve a strong balance sheet. Let me now turn it back to Steve for a review of our regions. Yes. So Ken, this is Amit here. So I think during the quarter, we saw strengthening in the dollar against most currencies, particularly the pound and the euro. So in the quarter, in quarter two, we saw an impact of about 3% to 4% across net sales, OP and EPS. Though you've got to remember, this was the toughest comp from -- our toughest quarter from a comp standpoint. I think for the full year, based on exchange rates today, I'd estimate it at around a 3% impact. Yes. Yes. So I think the remeasurement, that was triggered. It was technically triggered because of a number of retirees opting for a lump-sum pension payment. It increased to a point that triggered a remeasurement. So that's the reason why you're seeing why that remeasurement happened. And so I think -- so that's the reason why that happened. I think from a full year standpoint, I think you should see similar year-on-year decline, dollar declines as in the first half despite the comps are easier because we started seeing this trend in the second half of last year. So despite the easier comps, right, you're going to see a similar dollar and dollar declines in the second half as we saw in the first half.  And I think as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this will continue to be a headwind into 2023 where if markets stay where they are right now, obviously, we're going to see significantly lower asset values as we head into '23. So at current market levels, this would be a headwind that would continue into '23. So we continue to look for gross inflation on input costs to be in the high teens for the full year. In fact, if anything, it's now towards the absolute top end of that range. So incorporated in our guidance is an acceleration -- a continued acceleration in inflation. I think while the spot rates have moved down in some commodities, we are largely hedged for 2022 so we're not going to see any benefit in 2022. It's important also to note that while they move down, the spot rates have moved down, they're significantly higher. They continue to be higher than our averages for this year. And so we'll continue to see and plan for inflation into '23. Yes, I think from a gross margin standpoint, I think maybe I'll start with the full year and then we can get into the quarters. So I think in our last call, we had talked of a projection of a 100 basis point decline year-on-year in gross profit margin. I think sitting here today, we continue to see that range as being where we are from a full year standpoint.  I think in quarter 3, we will see incremental pressure year-on-year. And I think really what's changed is the supply chain bottlenecks, we are continuing to see that. And while it's improved in a couple of areas, broadly, I would say that we continue to see widespread bottlenecks and disruptions. Our previous assumption was that would diminish in quarter 3. I think now, our current planning assumption is that's going to diminish in quarter 4. So quarter 3 would continue to see incremental pressure year-on-year but it will moderate.  And I think our trend from a margin standpoint, the year-on-year decrease in quarter 3 will still continue a trend of sequential moderation in declines, just less than what we had previously expected. And then I think obviously, in quarter four, we start lapping the fire and strike. So we expect our margins -- gross margins to be up year-on-year in quarter four. And overall, for the year, still at that 100 basis point decline that we had talked in our last call. Yes, yes. And I think there's a little bit of ForEx impact in that so -- but yes. So I'd say most of it was price. And I think without getting into the specifics of prospective pricing, like I said, we continue to plan for an inflationary environment and protect our margins in that environment through a whole suite of revenue growth management actions. It's in the -- it's -- normally, we'd operate at around 4% range, 3% to 4% range. But I mean, this year with the bottlenecks, it's probably a little lower than the -- than what's normal, but in that ballpark. We did, Jason. So I think it's both. I think there are two impacts that come through, right? One is a low asset base creates a lower expected return on assets, right? So the rate on -- the expected return on assets is unchanged but it's just on a lower asset base, so that generates a lower pension income.  I think the other thing that we've done is we've updated the interest charge that flows through the P&L on your liabilities. So while your liabilities have gone down with a higher discount rate, the charge that you take for the year has gone up because of the higher interest cost. So we've done both, and both of those are reflected in our outlook. Yes. I think if you look at Keebler, right, in the end, and if you look at our '21 results and you look at where our overheads are, I think the teams and the organization did a terrific job working through the stranded costs. And so I think as you look back on our results, we worked those stranded costs through the system, and there was a lot of work to make that happen. So as we embark on this spin, I think we're very mindful of the challenge.  No question, our businesses are well integrated. And so as we -- and there are entanglements. But I think to the point that Steve was making, as we work on the separation, we are very mindful as well of stranded costs and program and having the necessary programs in place to address them over time. And the only thing I'd add is we've had multiple rounds of pricing around the world. And so I think we've been reacting to what we are seeing on commodities and input costs. As Steve said, we've got productivity programs in place so we've been through multiple rounds."

At this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for Kellogg Company. Mr. Renwick, you may begin your conference.\nJohn Renwick: Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for a review of our first quarter results and an update on our outlook for 2022. I'm joined this morning by Steve Cahillane, our Chairman and CEO, and Amit Banati our Chief Financial Officer. Slide Number 3 shows our forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware, certain statements made today such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the third slide of this presentation as well as to our public SEC filings. This is of particular note during the current COVID 19 pandemic and supply disruptions when the length and severity of these issues and result in economic and business impacts are so difficult to predict. A recording of today's webcast and supporting documents will be archived for at least 90 days on the Investor page of kelloggcompany.com. As always when referring to our results and outlook, unless otherwise noted, we will be referring to them on an organic basis for net sales and on an currency neutral adjusted basis for operating profit and earnings per share. And now I'll turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Cahillane: Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to be able to report another good quarter, delivering solid results even ahead of plan by sustaining growth momentum across our international businesses and our North America snacks brands realizing price and productivity amidst decades, high inflation and executing with agility. After all we are navigating through what I think you would all agree continues to be an extremely challenging operating environment. The situation in Ukraine only accelerated cost inflation and exacerbated the global economy's bottlenecks and shortages. It also prompted us to suspend all shipments and investments into Russia and to identify new sources for certain ingredients. Meanwhile, the team has done an excellent job of quickly restoring and ramping up production in our US cereal plants, following the fire end strike of last year's second half. Our inventory is gradually building toward normal levels as planned, enabling us to start replenishing retailer inventories earlier than expected in the first quarter. To be able to affirm our full year earnings guidance is a testament to our strategy, our brands and our people. Our deploy for growth strategy shown on Slide Number 5 is working. This strategy is still as appropriate and effective as ever, even as occasion shift and the operating environment evolves. We continue to emphasize occasions and build on our world-class brands. We continue to see the benefits of our reshaped portfolio and through extreme supply challenges, we continue to focus on service and in-store effectiveness. Behind all these growth boosters are capabilities that we have strengthened from data and analytics, to eCommerce, to revenue growth management, to a robust innovation pipeline. You're seeing the benefits of these capabilities in our actions and results. Simply put, the strategy is working. We remain equally focused on better days, our ESG strategy. Actions are louder than words. Slide Number 6 offers some examples of our ESG activities during the first quarter. They reflect continued action on various elements of ESG as we remain committed as ever to our values and doing what is right for the planet and for our communities. Sticking into our strategy and focusing on execution is resulting in sustained top line momentum as you can see on Slide Number 7. We had restored top line growth in 2019, experienced the pandemic-related acceleration in 2020, and yet sustained the strong growth in 2021 despite what we were lapping and in quarter one of this year, even with difficult comparisons, we continue to exceed our long-term target of 1% to 3% net sales growth with organic growth of more than 4%. I'll call out two key elements that are behind this momentum. The first is our reshaped portfolio. Our largest portfolio segment develop market snacks continued to generate strong growth led by world-class brands like Pringles, cheese it and others, and our emerging markets collectively sustained double-digit growth. So even in a quarter when one of our businesses North America cereal was notably soft, declining 10% year-on-year because of a lack of inventory, this was more than offset by momentum in the rest of our portfolio. And the second element is price realization. In an environment in which cost inflation is too high to cover with productivity alone, we have leveraged our enhanced revenue growth management capabilities to realize price effectively. We've been realizing price ever since cost inflation began to accelerate back in the second half of 2020 and we have accelerated as the market-driven cost inflation worsened. The result of all of this strategy, executional focus and sustained momentum is another quarter of delivering results and affirm full year outlook and increased cash to share owners as discussed on Slide number 8. We grew our net sales faster than we had anticipated, and we delivered more operating profit than we had projected. Our earnings per share and cash also came in ahead of our plan. This puts us in a good position. It allows us to affirm earnings guidance for the full year as an improved net sales outlook covers the impacts of accelerated cost inflation and supply disruptions, including Russia and Ukraine. It also enables us to increase the cash return to share owners, which we have done both in the form of accelerated share buybacks and an increased dividend. So with that introduction, let me now turn it over to Amit who will explain our results and outlook in more detail.\nAmit Banati: Thanks, Steve and good morning, everyone. As Steve said, we're off to a good start to 2022. We'll start with a brief summary of a quarter one financial two results on Slide Number 10. Our net sales growth came on top of similarly good growth in the year earlier quarter and is tracking ahead of our previous full year guidance. As expected, operating profit declined against last year's double-digit gain, but it should be noted that the year on year decline was entirely related to the wraparound impact to the fire end strike we experienced in 2021. Earning per share also exceeded our expectations, reflecting the better operating profit and with unfavorability in other income offset by some discrete favorable items in our tax rate. Cash flow came in ahead of plan and significant that last year. Slide Number 11, lays out the components of net sales growth in quarter one. Volume was down year on year due to lapping a strong two-year CAGR of nearly 4%, but also due to lacking inventory in certain businesses going into this year, most notably in our North America cereal business. In fact, North America's cereal volume decline represented almost half of our total companies year-on-year volume decline in the quarter. We also saw price elasticity resuming in many markets just as we have been forecasting, although still running well below historical levels. Price mix grew nearly 10% year-over-year and acceleration from recent quarters as we continue to work to offset market-driven cost inflation. This price realization is predominantly priced as we continue to implement revenue growth management actions in all four regions with a much smaller contribution coming from our mix shift towards snacks. The result was organic basis net sales growth of over 4% year on year, another strong quarterly performance that continues to exceed our long-term target. This was better than focused principally because of less price elasticity than expected, but also because of sooner than anticipated replenishment of trade inventories in North America cereal, at least some of which could be considered timing related. Foreign currency translation clipped nearly two percentage points of net sales growth in the quarter with a US dollar strengthening year-on-year against virtually all of our major currencies. Slide Number 12 shows our gross profit in dollars, as anticipated, our gross profit declined year-on-year principally because of supply disruption. The good news is that productivity and revenue growth management continued to mostly cover the market-driven cost inflation despite the latter accelerating again in the quarter. This is what we can manage and we've done a good job of it. The single largest driver of our gross profit decline was a transitory impact of the fire and strike we experienced in the second half of last year. This impact reflects not only lost sales year on year, but significant costs as well. On top of this, are the economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages that are expected to persist at least through the first half. These two factors accounted for almost all of our year-on-year decline in gross profit dollars in quarter one and about half of the margin contraction. These are transitory factors and should diminish as the year progresses. The rest of the margin contraction was related to mix. As we've discussed, our only meaningful mix headwind is the shift towards emerging markets and particularly toward our EMEA region and its Nigerian distributor business. Multipro. In Quarter One, this mix shift towards EMEA was especially pronounced. As we've often stated, this mix shift does not bother us because our growth in emerging markets and in Multipro are not cannibalizing any of our higher margin developed markets businesses, which brings us to operating profit on Slide Number 13. Despite transitory supply disruptions, our operating profit remains on an upward trajectory owing primarily to higher net sales with our supply constraint in many of our businesses, most notably in North America, cereal our advertising and promotion investment was much lower than usual in quarter one. As we discussed last quarter, this A&P investment is expected to be restored gradually across the year in line with our recovering supply. The result of our lower gross profit was a year on year decline in operating profit, which was also up against a double-digit growth comparison. Importantly though, a quarter one operating profit was still higher than that of quarter one 2020 and quarter one 2019, sustaining an upward trajectory. Turning now to our below the line items on Slide Number 14; lower debt year-on-year translated into lower interest expense, though the run up in rates during quarter one will likely create year-on-year increases in the coming quarters. Other income was negatively affected by lower pension income as expected, but also by the impact of a declining bond market on a company-owned life insurance investments. Lower net pension income will continue through the year. Our effective tax rate benefited from a couple of relatively small discrete items in quarter one, our JV earnings and minority interests collectively improved year on year reflecting the consolidation of certain Africa JVs at midyear last year and average shares outstanding decreased year-on-year, mainly reflecting the repurchases we made in 2021. We were active on buybacks during the quarter, and this will have an impact on average shares outstanding in quarter two. Let's look at our cash flow and balance sheet on Slide Number 15. Cash flow came in strongly in quarter one on the strength of higher net earnings, continued management of co-working capital and some timing of accrues and capital investment. As you can see on the chart, we stock the year well ahead of where we typically are in quarter one, aside from the unusual pandemic year of 2020. In addition, our net debt remains lower year on year. Between strong cash flow and or deleveraged balance, we feel good about our financial flexibility. This financial flexibility has given us the ability to increase the cash we return to share owners. We recently announced another increase in our dividend and in quarter one, we repurchased some 300 million of our stock. Let's now turn to the rest of the year. Our primary planning assumptions are shown on Slide Number 16. We expect to deliver sustained momentum on the top line led by our strong snacking portfolio around the world. And geographically by our emerging markets. Price mix would continue to drive our net sales growth as we try to keep up with rising costs and as we continue to assume, some combination of decelerating at home demand growth and resume price elasticity. Our market-driven cost inflation has gotten higher worsened by the war in Ukraine, and it looks like it will persist longer than originally anticipated. This has been incorporated into our outlook. From a supply disruption standpoint, we are largely past the fire and strike impact, though we will still expect bottleneck and shortages to persist at least through the first half, with disruption related to the war in Ukraine, more weighted to the second half. Meanwhile, as we mentioned, we do plan to gradually restore overhead and brand building investment across our regions as the year progresses, be it behind capabilities or resumed commercial activity behind supply constraint brands. Slide Number 17 shows how these planning assumptions translate into updated full year guidance. We are raising our forecast for organic basis net sales growth to about 4% growth versus our previous estimate of about 3%. This reflects the momentum in our business and the fact that price mix is likely to come in higher than we previously planned as we seek to cover incremental cost inflation. This higher net sales should offset the incremental pressures of accelerated cost inflation and supply disruption. As a result, we continue to focus currency-neutral adjusted basis growth of 1% to 2% in operating profit. We also continue to forecast currency neutral adjusted basis growth of 1% to 2% in earnings per share with a further reduction in other income, partially offset by the fully year flow through of quarter one, discrete tax benefits. From a phasing standpoint, the only new news since last quarter is that we got off to a better than expected start in quarter one, but that our second half will now experience more cost inflation and disruption and cost related to supply. Finally, we continue to forecast cash flow of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. This is roughly in line with our reported basis net income growth with no changes to our disciplined approach to restructuring outlays, co-working capital and capital expenditure. So in summary, we got off to a good start in quarter one, delivering solid financial results in the face of massive headwinds, and even putting us ahead of plan. Our brands continue to perform well and we have been effective at offsetting market-driven cost inflation with productivity and revenue growth management. Our cash flow generation remains strong and our balance sheet remains strong. So we feel good about our financial position and the outlook. Let me now turn it back to Steve for a review of our regions.\nSteve Cahillane: Thanks Amit. The first thing you'll note about our quarter one is the continuation of broad-based top-line growth. Slide Number 20 shows our organic net sales growth by region in the first quarter, along with the two-year CAGR they had to lap. We generated organic bases, net sales growth of 8% in Europe, 6% in Latin America and 17% in EMEA. These are exceptional growth rates. And in North America, where last year's fire and strike left us with low cereal inventory and therefore lost sales, our reported and organic net sales were still only down, less than 1%. In fact, if you exclude cereal, the rest of our North America business grew by 3% to 4% year on year, even against tough comparisons. In a moment, we'll walk you through the key category groups within each region. You'll see the continued exceptional growth of a relatively new growth leg for us and that's noodles in Africa. You'll see that cereal and frozen foods, the category groups that are the most at home in nature have therefore seen the most deceleration as consumer mobility has increased, but outside of North America with its supply disruption from the fire and strike, we do continue to grow in cereal internationally, but you'll also see that in all four regions, our biggest category group snacks, continue to grow strongly, even against tough two year comparisons. Slide Number 21 offers the world-class snacks brands we've been talking to you about, and they had another quarter of excellent consumption growth. Pringles continues to gain penetration and distribution in key markets around the world and continued its strong consumption in net sales growth in the first quarter. Cheez-It, already a powerhouse in the US is growing rapidly in Canada and is off to a strong start in its launch in Brazil. Pop-Tarts continues to grow in the US, but look at its growth rates in markets like the UK and Mexico as well. Rice Krispies Treats is enjoying explosive growth in several markets outside of the US as we put more focus and support behind that unique brand. Not only are these brands continuing to grow in North America, but this chart can give you a glimpse of their international potential. Aside from Pringles, these brands are in very early days of expansion, which is part of our strategy and their growth rates speak to their long-term potential. Let's now review each region in turn, starting with North America on Slide Number 22. North America's net sales declined slightly on an organic basis owing to the fire and strike related impact on cereal. Supply constraints, most notably low inventory heading into the quarter for cereal did pressure volume, but as we'll see in a moment, we did sustain good momentum elsewhere in the portfolio, especially in snacks. Price mix grew more than 7% year on year as we continue to implement revenue growth management actions. Operating profit declined year on year, not only because of lapping a mid-single digit two year CAGR, but also because of the bottlenecks and shortages that persist in the economy and the wraparound impacts from the fire and strike we experienced in the second half of 2021. Our snacks business in North America posted organic net sales growth of 5% in the quarter. As you can see on Slide Number 23, this sales growth lag consumption, which remained quite strong. Pringles generated consumption growth of more than 8% year-on-year lapping last year's double digit gain. This brand is in very good shape. We saw strong growth in our core four flavors in standard cans propelled by effective brand building, including our super bowl execution and we saw continued rapid growth in multi-packs and in a sign of resuming consumer mobility, we are seeing a rebound in immediate consumption offerings as well. Cheez-It also sustained its strong momentum growing consumption in the double digits with the new puff platform, proving to be incremental to both the snap platform and the core cracker line, but we didn't just gain share in crackers because of Cheez-It. We also outpaced the category with the club and townhouse brands, Pop-Tarts grew consumption in the double digits and so did Rice Krispies Treats with both brands sustaining excellent momentum through the strength of effective marketing programs and incremental innovation. And while we're at it, Nutri-Grain also grew consumption in the double digits and RX continues to reaccelerate its growth as consumers go back on the move. So our North America snacks business remains very strong. Let's turn now to North America cereal on Slide Number 24. Recall that 2022 is all about recovering from last year's fire and strike. As you know, we entered the quarter with very low finished goods inventory, which obviously hampered our net sales and consumption year on year. The good news is that our first order of business in quarter one was restoring production in the four affected plants, which our team achieved and ahead of schedule. With demand holding up well and retailers anxious to restore their inventories, we were able to ship out more product in the first quarter than we had anticipated. This certainly will help us improve consumption, going forward. Slide Number 25 offers a good way to gauge our progress on restoring supply. It measures our share against our total distribution points. You can see the sharp decline in last year's fourth quarter, as retailers ran through their inventory and we were unable to partnership it. As we ramped up production during the first quarter, you can see product returning to the shells in the form of recovering TDPs and therefore share. This reflects our improving supply and is a testament to the strength of our brands and relationships with our retail partners. This sequential improvement is what we to continue to realize as we get through the first half. In fact, this positive trend has continued quite clearly in April. This will put us right on track to gradually restore commercial plans brand by brand toward full recovery in the second half. Our frozen businesses in North America are depicted on Slide Number 26. Consumption growth remained strong with mid-single digit growth on top of a mid-single digit two-year CAGR. This is good performance given that we've been capacity constrained, especially on pancakes. The even better news is that we have incremental capacity coming online in the second quarter. In our plant-based business, Morningstar farms consumption was down against the mid-teens two year CAGR comparison and the category has paused on distribution gains and household penetration gains after surging the past couple of years. We've seen some share losses, competitors have entered and expanded offerings in our segments and in many cases competing intensely on price. So in total, North America got off to a good start in the first quarter with progress on supply recovery in cereal and in market momentum elsewhere in the portfolio. Closing out North America Slide Number 27 highlights some of the exciting innovations and commercial programs we have going into the marketplace. To remind you that even though we're in an unusual supply environment, we continue to delight consumers. On the innovation front, Cheez-It puff is off to an even faster start than Snaft [ph] the platform we launched a couple of years ago. Club Crisps is also new to the market, providing a light and fresh snack that's built on the strength of our Club Crackers line. For Pop Tarts we've launched new flavors like Snicker Doodle, expanded on a simple ingredient line called Pop Tarts Simply and brought back a fan favorite Frosted Grape. And in Frozen, beyond the lookout for Eggo's new Liege-Style Waffles for on the go consumption and some exciting new varieties of Morningstar farms, including a delicious pancake wrap sausage on a stick. From a marketing standpoint, Mission Tiger is roaring back, helping kids gain better access to use sports. These are just a few examples of why we are so confident that we can sustain our snacks momentum, recover cereal and reaccelerate Frozen. Now let's discuss Europe shown on Slide Number 28. Europe had another outstanding quarter growing net sales 8% and operating profit by 28%. Even as it lapsed strong year ago growth for both metrics. While volume was down against the tough comparisons, Europe's RGM efforts continued to generate price mix growth and productivity also helped to cover costs enabling increased A&P investment. On Slide Number 29, you can see that we experienced organic net sales growth in both snacks and cereal in the first quarter, despite what were very tough comparisons on a two-year basis. In snacks, the growth is underpinned by fantastic momentum in consumption for Pringles which gains share in markets like Germany, Italy and Spain and lagged the category's double-digit growth in the UK only because of tougher comparisons. We should also point out that in portable wholesome snacks, where categories are rebounding on a return to consumer mobility, our efforts to revitalize brands like Rice Crispy Squares and Pop Tarts are starting to pay off, with share gains in markets like the UK and Italy. In cereal, assumption is moderating across the region as consumer mobility and price elasticity resumes. While we have gained share in the UK and Germany, we have seated share in other markets in part because of lapping tougher comparisons. Nevertheless, some key supported brands continue to do well as shown on this slide. A quick word about the situation in Ukraine, Russia and Ukraine represent less than 1.5% of our total company net sales, and less than 10% of our sales in Europe. We have suspended shipments and investments into Russia, which will have a direct impact on our sales and profit in Europe this year. This is incorporated into our updated guidance. Overall though, Kellogg Europe is off to a very good start to 2022, and we feel good about the business. Now let's discuss Latin America, turning to Slide Number 30. Latin America too faced notably impressed of comparisons, particularly on a two-year CAGR basis and especially on operating profit. But this business got off to a good start with year-on-year net sales growth driven by price mix growth and operating profit that declined less than we had expected. Slide Number 31 shows that our Latin American net sales growth was led by snacks. Here too, Pringles is showing impressive momentum, outpatient in the category's double-digit growth in Mexico and Brazil. In portable wholesome snacks our consumption has rebounded faster than the category in our principle markets of Mexico and Puerto Rico and cereal category consumption growth remains robust across the region and we outpace the category in key markets, However, tough comparisons and regulatory hurdles in Mexico negatively impacted our cereal net sales in the quarter. Nonetheless, our Latin America business continues to perform well. Let's finish our business review with EMEA on Slide Number 32. Quarter one featured another exceptional performance by our fastest growing region. Despite lapping a strong two-year CAGR for volume EMEA continued to leverage RGM for exceptional price realization across the region, which helped it offset the margin impact of high costs. The result was double-digit growth in both net sales and operating profit versus the prior year. Slide Number 33 shows how EMEA net sales growth was generated across all three of our product category groups in the region. Noodles was once again the largest contributor to the growth, reflecting exceptional growth by Multipro in West Africa and our continued expansion of the Kelloggs Noodles brand in markets like Egypt and South Africa. Our strong snacks growth was led by Pringles, which sustained goods consumption growth, even as it entered the quarter with low inventories coming out of last year's COVID related production restrictions. In portable wholesome snacks, our double-digit growth was strong enough to gain share in Australia and in the rest of the region. In cereal, the overall region's category has decelerated to modest growth, but we have gained share led by Australia, Korea and South Africa. So to close out of prepared remarks, let me briefly summarize with Slide Number 35. We're off to a very good start to the year. We remain right on strategy as ever focused on dependable, balanced financial delivery. We are navigating well through unprecedented cost and supply challenges and through it all, we have sustained top line momentum, both in net sales and consumption growth. This reflects the strength of our reshaped portfolio, particularly our international markets and our North America snacks and frozen businesses. It also reflects what we have done on revenue growth management in order to help cover rising costs. Put it all together and we come at to quarter one ahead of plan, which is an important benefit as we look ahead to continued uncertain market conditions. We are affirming our guidance for the year and we are increasing the cash we return to share owners. As always, I can't thank enough the talented, resourceful and persevering Kellogg employees who have made performance and our bright prospects possible. And with that, we'll open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question is from Chris Growe from Stifel. Chris, your line is open.\nChris Growe: Hi. Good morning.\nSteve Cahillane: Good morning, Chris.\nChris Growe: I just had a question. Hi, good morning. I had a question for you if I could. Steve you'd mentioned about being able to rebuild inventory a little faster and I guess I want to ask first, is that a US comment? I presume it is versus a global comment. I think it's an area where you've had a little more of a shortage. And then just to get a sense of where you are in the recovery. You showed a chart with TPDs and kind of rebuilding distribution in cereal. But is it Q2 when that kind of starts to make a further pushup? I just want to get a sense of where you are in that process.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. Thanks, Chris. It is a U.S. comment. I mean inventories are down really across the globe, generally speaking, because of supply shortages, bottlenecks and the like. But the big issue for us is in the U.S. and predominantly in cereal because of the fire and strike. And so we're ahead of where we plan to be. So that's great. I give a real tip of the cap to our 4 cereal plants that came back to work, came back motivated and are building inventory ahead of plan. And we appreciate that and those efforts and the leadership in the plants and the plant workers. The second quarter, you'll see accelerated commercial activity. And really in the back half of the year is when we plan to be resuming full commercial activity against our cereal portfolio. So that's why we're encouraging looking at the sequential improvement. If you look at year-over-year performance and share in U.S. cereal, clearly still down, but that's based on low inventories and lack of commercial activity. But when you look at the sequential performance of the business, our goal is each and every week to continue to build our TDPs and each and every week to continue to accelerate our share momentum and get back to where we belong because the brands are still incredibly strong, relationships with retailers continues to be very, very strong, and we're working together to get this business back to where it belongs.\nChris Growe: Okay. And I had just a quick question for Amit on inflation. Can you give the rate of inflation -- if you did, I missed it, I'm sorry -- for the first quarter? And then how that fares versus the remainder of the year? And then to what degree you may be hedged on those input costs?\nAmit Banati: Yes. So on inflation, I think we talked in our last call as well that we ended the year with an outlook of double-digit inflation. I think through the quarter, we saw that inflation accelerates. And I think when I look at the rest of the year, what's incorporated in our guidance is continued double-digit inflation. It's notched up by 2 to 3 points. So that's kind of what's been incorporated in our guidance. I think in hedge levels, we are almost at around 80% level of hedging. So that's where we sit. But it's important to note that this is just for traded commodities, which is about a quarter of all our costs. Yes. The only thing -- only other thing I'd add is that our outlook now for inflation goes into the second half. And so it's not moderating at the level that we thought it would.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jason English from Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Good news. I really got lots of questions left. So first, Amit or Steve, I forget who had said it, but I heard comments of price left to see returning in some markets. Can you elaborate which markets were you seeing heightened or return to more normalized type price sensitivity from consumers?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes, Jason. So I'll start, and Amit can add. We're seeing clearly elasticity still well below normal levels. So I think that's the important thing to note. But we are seeing -- when you look at 2-year CAGRs, we're starting to see the return of elasticities, which is not surprising given the level of pricing that's in the market. You're seeing it more in some of the at-home meal occasions. So cereal and frozen. We're seeing a little bit more snacking, less so. And we're incorporating that into our guidance. So we're planning on elasticities growing as pricing continues to be very elevated but still below what you would normally see prior to all these disruptions.\nAmit Banati: Yes. The only other thing I'd add, Jason, is that the elasticity was better than what we had expected, and that's kind of one of the factors that drove the outperformance versus our plan in quarter 1. So far, it's been better than what we had expected.\nJason English: Yes. Got it. It seems pretty consistent over here in industry [indiscernible]. One more slightly more nuanced question. I think you know we've got these gross margin bridges where we try to tie gross margin every quarter. And for a very long time, there's been leakage there. It's either due to inefficiencies like a single-serve pack initiative. It's due to mix like the African business, maybe outpacing everything else. This is one of the few quarters where on our math, like, there really is no leakage. You're kind of back to whole. I can plug in the math, and the math works. I know you can take out another 100 to 200 basis points. And I guess my question is, are you aware of why? Like why might the flow-through be a little more cleaner? And are we at a point where we may not be facing the same degree of maybe mix or mix degradation or leakage going forward?\nAmit Banati: Yes. I think, Jason, if you look at our quarter, right, quarter 1, our gross margins were down 280 basis points. I think the biggest driver of that was the impact -- was the wraparound impact of the fire and strike. So that, I would say, would be almost half of the of the gross margin decline in the quarter. We continue to see bottlenecks and shortages. So that continues to impact the gross margin. Our assumption is that it will continue through the first half of this year and then start moderating in the second half. So I think that's the -- that was the single biggest impact in the quarter. From a mix standpoint, again, the mix, we did see a mix impact just given the level of growth in EMEA, which grew 17% in the quarter. So that mix shift -- I would say that mix shift would continue as AMEA continues to grow faster, but it was more pronounced in quarter 1. And I think when you kind of look at the outlook for the year, what's in our guidance is an improving trend. I would expect gross margins to continue to decline in the coming quarters before bouncing back in quarter 4 when we lapped last year's fire and strike, but definitely an improving trend because the impact of the fire and strike is now behind us. And I think when you kind of look at the outlook for gross margin for the full year, I'd say sitting here today we'd probably say that it will be down around 1%.\nOperator: The next call question is from Cody Ross from UBS.\nCody Ross: In the press release, you noted higher price/mix as the reason for the higher organic sales outlook for the year. Does that mean you're taking another round of price? And if so, which parts of your portfolio is that in? What's the magnitude? And when will that be affected?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. Cody, thanks for the question. So we don't comment on prospective pricing. But I think when you look at what we've done, it's a good indication of what we'll plan for in the future. So we have -- in terms of our revenue, our net sales growth, it's virtually all price/mix, right? And that's due to obviously the incredible input cost inflation that we're seeing and the fact that productivity just simply can't cover this type of inflationary environment. We see that continuing. And so as we look forward, we're going to continue to look at productivity as the first line of defense, but we're going to be in a situation where it's not going to be enough, and we'll look at our whole revenue growth management toolkit in order to protect and preserve our margins going forward. And excuse me, that's around the world. So that's not just the United States phenomenon.\nCody Ross: Got it. And then you noted you were able to start replenishing retailer inventory levels in the U.S. cereal earlier than expected. However, your volume came in worse than we anticipated. Did it come in line with your expectations? And how much do you think inventory replenishment benefit North America?\nSteve Cahillane: I wouldn't say it benefited North America. I mean the entire decline was in Rtech only. And if you -- like we said in the prepared remarks, if you were to remove U.S. cereal, the U.S. business was -- or the North American business was actually up 3% to 4%. And so it was slightly better than we anticipated, but we anticipated it being significantly down. But we're pleased that the inventory levels are starting to replenish, and we look at the back half of the year as really being when the Rtech business starts to get back on track. But if you look at the snacks business, for example, shipments actually lag consumption in that category.\nOperator: Our next question is from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse.\nRobert Moskow: Can I ask you to drill down a little bit more into Europe? With profits up, I think it was 28%, it just seems a little inconsistent with the commentary about Russia and Ukraine being a headwind and volumes being down. So why was it so good? And is it possible that the lower spending in Russia is actually helping more than hurting?\nSteve Cahillane: No, Rob. I'd say a couple of things. First, the Russia-Ukraine impact will be a second half impact, right? So we didn't feel that effect in the first quarter, but we will feel that going forward, and that's why we incorporated that into our outlook. And the real story, to be honest with you, in the European businesses, this is 4 years on the trough that this business has been performing very, very well. It was a bit of an outsized performance, but they grew in snacks. They stabilized cereal. They grew in wholesome snacks. And when I say they grew in snacks, I mean, Pringles consumption growth has been exceptional behind gaming, messaging, soccer events, incremental innovations like Rice Fusion and Sizzlin' ]. And the team performed extremely well when it comes to revenue growth management as well. And spending was in line with what we anticipated. So it was just an excellent quarter driven by very, very good top line performance that flowed through to the bottom line. And like I said, this is 4 years now where our European business has been performing well. And I tell the team when I visit there that there's not too many businesses like ours that talk about Europe as a growth driver to their company, but it is for us, and we're very proud of the team's performance there.\nRobert Moskow: And maybe I can have a follow-up for Amit. SG&A from a corporate standpoint was down $50 million year-over-year in the quarter. How do you think it's going to kind of lay out for the rest of the year? Is it still down in 2Q and then ramp up in the back half when U.S. cereal spending goes higher? And then also, I think you gave guidance for 2% to 3% FX headwind for the year last quarter. What is it now?\nAmit Banati: All right. So I'll start with SG&A. I think it was planned. Quarter 1 was planned. We knew that we were low on inventory in U.S. cereal. And so I think we've adjusted our spending appropriately. And so that's kind of what's played through. I think, as I mentioned, as the year goes through, we will restore our levels of advertising and commercial activity once supply picks up. So that's very much the plan. And I think from a full year standpoint, I'd say flattish SG&A on -- is kind of our outlook, excluding currency. So that's the SG&A plan for the year. I think on -- in terms of currency, yes, I mean, based on where currencies are today, we'd probably be in that same 2% to 3% range. I think we saw about a 2% impact in quarter 1, but 2% to 3% is kind of the outlook.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler.\nMichael Lavery: I just want to come back to Europe, following up a little bit on Rob's question. Anybody who just was on the [indiscernible] might be panicking over the European consumer. And that was a little bit more focused on the U.K. Your business, I think, may be spread out a little bit more. But you touched on how well it's doing there. We clearly see that in the numbers. Can you just maybe give us a sense of how much that's category difference? You're gaining some share. So clearly, it's a brand difference. But maybe also, just is there a watch out that it might be slowing down? Just broadly, they've been talking about the total grocery store sales being down mid to high single-digit percent in the U.K. You're up 12% there. How do we think about what's ahead? Can you keep this going? Or is there some slowdown we should be expecting? How do you think about the rest of the year?\nSteve Cahillane: Well, the biggest impact to the rest of the year is, as we said, the Russia-Ukraine situation and the fact that we're not shipping into Russia. We have a Pringles business there that we've discontinued, and we're not shipping anything into Russia. But in terms of the consumer and the outlook, what I would tell you is the Rtech category, we have seen it decelerating, but the salty remains extremely strong. Our portable wholesome snacks business is really coming back as the consumer is coming back. So when we look at our categories, it's -- what you saw in the first quarter was exactly that. The Rtech slowing down, kind of flattish and salty being very strong and wholesome snacks being very strong. And inside those categories with our brands performing very well, highly differentiated, great innovations coming to market, we anticipate that continuing. And as I said to Rob, it's 4 years now that this business has reliably delivered on the top line and the bottom line. Clearly, it's a more challenging environment now. We're seeing inflation in Continental Europe. You haven't seen that in a long time. What was typically a deflationary environment has shifted. So clearly, that will have pressure on the consumer. But what we're seeing right now is, obviously, that's pervasive everywhere. And so it's not just at the grocery store. Just like in all parts of the country, it's wide ranging. And the fact that we are in the types of business that we're in is a good place to be in an environment like this. And when you have strong brands inside of that, it's an even better place to be. So we're very confident in the European performance continuing to be strong.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. That's helpful. And I just want to follow up on Morningstar. You gave -- you touched on a little bit there with some pausing household penetration and distribution gains and some price competition. But how much is that decline would you say more driven by the consumer versus competition? Is there sort of a plateau in consumer interest? Is it really just more some of the competitive intensity? And maybe one clarification, too. With that Morningstar bar chart, it's under North America Frozen. Is it just a simplicity of the language where that also includes the refrigerated incognito? Or is that strictly speaking just the Frozen piece of that brand?\nSteve Cahillane: No. I think -- I'll start there. That includes the incognito, which is a small portion of the total Morningstar Farms. In the broader question around what's happening in the category, I'd say, in effect, you can think about the pandemic having pulled forward trial penetration and buy rates. And you saw that in the first year because there was so much at-home consumption across the grocery store, and this was a new hot category. I think it jumped forward 2 years. You also saw irrational exuberance in the category and the entrant of many, many new players, which took a lot of shelf space, took a lot of trial, not always the highest quality offerings, to be honest with you. And we've seen this in many categories in the past that take off -- they have a shakeout period. And I think what you're seeing now is a bit of that hangover from the pull forward of all those various components. Morningstar Farms, that's why we're looking at the 2-year CAGR. It's still the original since 1975, a very, very strong consumer base. When we look at our brand equity scores, we know that it's still performing very, very well. And so we're bullish on the category and the brand. But I think what we're seeing is, again, just the pull forward from the pandemic and having to lap that rather exceptional year.\nOperator: The next question is from Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley.\nPamela Kaufman: I have a follow-up question to Rob's question on SG&A. Just wanted to see if you could give details on how much brand building was down in Q1. And was this just in cereal or other aspects of the portfolio? And then how should we think about your brand building investments increasing in the second half as cereal comes back to fuller inventory levels?\nAmit Banati: Yes. I think it was predominantly North America cereal, and it was planned. And I think we knew that going into the year. We knew that going into the quarter. And I think the good news is production is ahead of plan. We are ramping up inventory. And so we'll be restoring commercial activity faster than planned. And I think the spending will follow that. And I think, as I mentioned earlier, from a full year standpoint, our outlook is, call it, flattish with our currency -- on a currency-neutral basis. So that -- on SG&A. So that's kind of the shape of how the spend will be through the course of the year.\nPamela Kaufman: Great. And it seems like you are making good progress on rebuilding cereal inventory, and it's coming in ahead of plan. When do you expect to see a recovery in North America cereal market share? And how do you think about balancing pricing growth on cereal with restoring market share and regaining TDPs?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. So Pamela, what I'd say is, as I said in the prepared remarks, we're looking at sequential recovery, right? And we're not going to forecast market share when we're going to be at a certain point, but we're bound and determined to continue week after week, month after month to continue to build our TDPs, build our shelf presence, build our commercial activity, which includes displays and merchandising, so that we exit the year with great momentum close to where perhaps we were before all this occurred. And so that's essentially the way we're thinking about it. The second half has the return to commercial activity that looks much more similar to prestrike. And so that's how we're thinking about it. We're pleased about the progress to date, but we remain very aggressive in terms of making sure that we continue the progress that we've seen so far.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.\nKen Goldman: I think there was some concern among investors, I guess, including me that your Africa business might have trouble later this year, maybe procuring all the weed it needs just given that Africa in general buys a lot from Eastern Europe. So I think you relayed a lot of those concerns today, great to hear, but I think there's still a desire to hear maybe a bit more about where your business in Africa, your noodle business in particular, right, procures most of its wheat, how locked in it is, and if there is any risk you see of just not being able to get product beyond just the inflationary factor.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes, Ken. So obviously, we're very pleased with the African performance in general, Multipro in particular. You're seeing their ability to take price is exceptional to cover rising input costs, currency and so forth. And we've mentioned many times, they've got they've got 4 decades of experience on the African continent. And their agility and ability to overcome obstacles continues to be very, very impressive. And the moat that we've built around that country in terms of our route to market with Multipro continues to be impressive. They're adding suppliers. They're adding points of distribution on a regular basis to continue to build that business. Now on the procurement front, there's clearly a lot of wheat that comes from Russia and Ukraine, and they've pivoted to all around the world to get supplies to replace that, and they've done that very effectively. And that's really across the world. And so they've got line of sight to good product production. They've got line of sight to meet our noodles forecasts for the remainder of the year and even into next year. And so I think it's down to execution. It's down to planning, and it's down to just the experience that they bring to bear in virtually everything that they do. Amit, I don't know if you want to add anything.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Palmer of Evercore.\nDavid Palmer: And just one more follow-up question on the amazing quarter you guys are having in Europe and the snacks. Just judging from one of your slides, it looks like you had mid-teens organic growth there, which was very impressive. You had -- I think it was 10 points of price there, which is also impressive. It's typically a market where it takes a while to get pricing in place. So there are some things that are just impressive versus the peers out there. But I'm wondering if there's other insights about maybe this being more of a mobility play on your snacks business there than what we would typically see from your snacks business here in the U.S. where a lot of the snacks were had more at home or at least some of the marketing was more around mobility and why that should be sustaining from here. And any sort of like timing benefits that might have happened for the first quarter?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes, David. So there's really no timing benefits in the first quarter. As I said, it's just a very, very good quarter that Europe delivered. Part of the mobility and return to mobility definitely benefits our portable wholesome snacks. So that's kind of a new third leg that is performing now very well. Pringles, one of the magic of Pringles is it's a very differentiated brand. Its innovation performance in Europe has been very strong. And its brand messaging and communication has been very strong. And that's allowed us to do a couple of things over the course of the last, call it, 18 to 24 months. And that breaks some magic price points that had existed in the marketplace for some time. And so there's no ceiling on -- there's no artificial ceiling on Pringles in terms of, call it, a GBP1.99 in Europe. It's burst through that. And once you do that and prove to retailers and consumers that the brand is worth that, you start to see some continuing benefits. And so I'd say, breaking magic price points because of the investments in innovation and brand marketing, the return of wholesome snacks, the stabilization of cereal, it's just -- it's been a solidly delivered plan by Europe, and that's why we have confidence ex the Ukraine-Russia terrible situation that the underlying momentum continues.\nDavid Palmer: No, that was outstanding. And I guess one follow-up to I think it was Pamela's question about the rebuilding of market share and points of distribution for cereal. I mean do you see any barriers or maybe if there's a friction point or 2 you'd call out that would -- that you have to address in getting back to those prestrike, prefire levels of 28%, 29% market share, for example, what would you call out there that you're trying to perhaps overcome as you're getting back to those levels?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. So first, I'd start with saying we are not at all complacent about this, and we're not at all underestimating the challenge of rebuilding our business, but we do know a couple of things. The brands are very, very strong. So if you look at the brands that have returned to I wouldn't even say yet adequate levels of inventory, but better levels of inventory like Fruit Loops and Frosted Flakes, performing well, getting their shares back. And then brands like -- some other brands -- Rice Krispies is one where obviously was very impacted by the fire, not yet there because the inventories aren't close to where we need them to be. And so we do know that the brands are -- remain very strong. These are iconic brands that consumers love. They're important to our retail partners. And again, we don't take that for granted. But as we rebuild inventory and we put commercial activity behind these beloved brands and we get our TDPs back, then we're very confident we'll continue to improve the business and get it back to where it belongs. But again, we don't take that for granted. We've got work to do, but we know what that work is, we know how to do it, and we're doing it.\nOperator: Our final question is from Alexia Howard from Bernstein.\nAlexia Howard: Can I just ask about the input cost inflation? You said double digits for the year and that have increased 2% to 3% since last quarter. Are we talking about level, high teens, low teens, low double digits? Just to give us an idea of where you sit versus everybody else. And given the length of the hedges, I know you can't give us exact numbers, but would it -- would we be directionally correct in thinking that the step-up in grain and oil inflation that happened as a result of Russia-Ukraine is really not likely to hit you until very late in 2022 and looking out into 2023? And I have a follow-up.\nAmit Banati: Alexia, I think if you were to kind of look at specifics, it was in the teens. When we started, it was probably in the mid-teens. It's moved up 2 or 3 points from there. So that's kind of the level of inflation that we're looking at. And I think in terms of the hedges, again, it obviously covers a lot of commodities. And like I said, at an overall level, we are around 80%. We have a rolling program. And so I think we keep adding on a rolling basis. So as some of the Russia-Ukraine, is it already in, some of it is in, but it will continue to bleed through, right, as we continue to add hedges through the program. We have visibility into what our '23 outlook is. And so I think that's all going in to the planning as we look at our revenue growth management plans ahead of us.\nAlexia Howard: Great. And just as a follow-up. I'm curious about the U.K. -- as a follow-up to Michael Lavery's question. How big is the U.K. to you guys at this point? And should we be worried about the change in regulations about labeling and product positioning in store for products that contain a fair amount of sugar? I know that there's a certain legal action with the U.K. government going on at the moment. I'm just curious about how you see that impacting your business later in the year.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes, Alexia. So it's about 5% of our business. And the HFSS, high fat sodium sugar content is what you're referring to. And we have -- we're building plans to overcome merchandising, restrictions and so forth for all of the brands that are affected. So we're very confident we'll be able to do that. We don't see any impact for the remainder of this year. And we remain constructively engaged despite -- despite the legal activity, we remain constructively engaged and hopeful that we'll be able to work something out with the U.K. government. But it's all incorporated in the guidance.\nJohn Renwick: Okay. Operator, we are at 10:30. Thank you, everybody, for your interest. And if you do have follow-up calls, please do not hesitate to call us.\nOperator: That concludes our conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Steve Cahillane",
            "content": "Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to be able to report another good quarter, delivering solid results even ahead of plan by sustaining growth momentum across our international businesses and our North America snacks brands realizing price and productivity amidst decades, high inflation and executing with agility. After all we are navigating through what I think you would all agree continues to be an extremely challenging operating environment. The situation in Ukraine only accelerated cost inflation and exacerbated the global economy's bottlenecks and shortages. It also prompted us to suspend all shipments and investments into Russia and to identify new sources for certain ingredients. Meanwhile, the team has done an excellent job of quickly restoring and ramping up production in our US cereal plants, following the fire end strike of last year's second half. Our inventory is gradually building toward normal levels as planned, enabling us to start replenishing retailer inventories earlier than expected in the first quarter. To be able to affirm our full year earnings guidance is a testament to our strategy, our brands and our people. Our deploy for growth strategy shown on Slide Number 5 is working. This strategy is still as appropriate and effective as ever, even as occasion shift and the operating environment evolves. We continue to emphasize occasions and build on our world-class brands. We continue to see the benefits of our reshaped portfolio and through extreme supply challenges, we continue to focus on service and in-store effectiveness. Behind all these growth boosters are capabilities that we have strengthened from data and analytics, to eCommerce, to revenue growth management, to a robust innovation pipeline. You're seeing the benefits of these capabilities in our actions and results. Simply put, the strategy is working. We remain equally focused on better days, our ESG strategy. Actions are louder than words. Slide Number 6 offers some examples of our ESG activities during the first quarter. They reflect continued action on various elements of ESG as we remain committed as ever to our values and doing what is right for the planet and for our communities. Sticking into our strategy and focusing on execution is resulting in sustained top line momentum as you can see on Slide Number 7. We had restored top line growth in 2019, experienced the pandemic-related acceleration in 2020, and yet sustained the strong growth in 2021 despite what we were lapping and in quarter one of this year, even with difficult comparisons, we continue to exceed our long-term target of 1% to 3% net sales growth with organic growth of more than 4%. I'll call out two key elements that are behind this momentum. The first is our reshaped portfolio. Our largest portfolio segment develop market snacks continued to generate strong growth led by world-class brands like Pringles, cheese it and others, and our emerging markets collectively sustained double-digit growth. So even in a quarter when one of our businesses North America cereal was notably soft, declining 10% year-on-year because of a lack of inventory, this was more than offset by momentum in the rest of our portfolio. And the second element is price realization. In an environment in which cost inflation is too high to cover with productivity alone, we have leveraged our enhanced revenue growth management capabilities to realize price effectively. We've been realizing price ever since cost inflation began to accelerate back in the second half of 2020 and we have accelerated as the market-driven cost inflation worsened. The result of all of this strategy, executional focus and sustained momentum is another quarter of delivering results and affirm full year outlook and increased cash to share owners as discussed on Slide number 8. We grew our net sales faster than we had anticipated, and we delivered more operating profit than we had projected. Our earnings per share and cash also came in ahead of our plan. This puts us in a good position. It allows us to affirm earnings guidance for the full year as an improved net sales outlook covers the impacts of accelerated cost inflation and supply disruptions, including Russia and Ukraine. It also enables us to increase the cash return to share owners, which we have done both in the form of accelerated share buybacks and an increased dividend. So with that introduction, let me now turn it over to Amit who will explain our results and outlook in more detail. Thanks Amit. The first thing you'll note about our quarter one is the continuation of broad-based top-line growth. Slide Number 20 shows our organic net sales growth by region in the first quarter, along with the two-year CAGR they had to lap. We generated organic bases, net sales growth of 8% in Europe, 6% in Latin America and 17% in EMEA. These are exceptional growth rates. And in North America, where last year's fire and strike left us with low cereal inventory and therefore lost sales, our reported and organic net sales were still only down, less than 1%. In fact, if you exclude cereal, the rest of our North America business grew by 3% to 4% year on year, even against tough comparisons. In a moment, we'll walk you through the key category groups within each region. You'll see the continued exceptional growth of a relatively new growth leg for us and that's noodles in Africa. You'll see that cereal and frozen foods, the category groups that are the most at home in nature have therefore seen the most deceleration as consumer mobility has increased, but outside of North America with its supply disruption from the fire and strike, we do continue to grow in cereal internationally, but you'll also see that in all four regions, our biggest category group snacks, continue to grow strongly, even against tough two year comparisons. Slide Number 21 offers the world-class snacks brands we've been talking to you about, and they had another quarter of excellent consumption growth. Pringles continues to gain penetration and distribution in key markets around the world and continued its strong consumption in net sales growth in the first quarter. Cheez-It, already a powerhouse in the US is growing rapidly in Canada and is off to a strong start in its launch in Brazil. Pop-Tarts continues to grow in the US, but look at its growth rates in markets like the UK and Mexico as well. Rice Krispies Treats is enjoying explosive growth in several markets outside of the US as we put more focus and support behind that unique brand. Not only are these brands continuing to grow in North America, but this chart can give you a glimpse of their international potential. Aside from Pringles, these brands are in very early days of expansion, which is part of our strategy and their growth rates speak to their long-term potential. Let's now review each region in turn, starting with North America on Slide Number 22. North America's net sales declined slightly on an organic basis owing to the fire and strike related impact on cereal. Supply constraints, most notably low inventory heading into the quarter for cereal did pressure volume, but as we'll see in a moment, we did sustain good momentum elsewhere in the portfolio, especially in snacks. Price mix grew more than 7% year on year as we continue to implement revenue growth management actions. Operating profit declined year on year, not only because of lapping a mid-single digit two year CAGR, but also because of the bottlenecks and shortages that persist in the economy and the wraparound impacts from the fire and strike we experienced in the second half of 2021. Our snacks business in North America posted organic net sales growth of 5% in the quarter. As you can see on Slide Number 23, this sales growth lag consumption, which remained quite strong. Pringles generated consumption growth of more than 8% year-on-year lapping last year's double digit gain. This brand is in very good shape. We saw strong growth in our core four flavors in standard cans propelled by effective brand building, including our super bowl execution and we saw continued rapid growth in multi-packs and in a sign of resuming consumer mobility, we are seeing a rebound in immediate consumption offerings as well. Cheez-It also sustained its strong momentum growing consumption in the double digits with the new puff platform, proving to be incremental to both the snap platform and the core cracker line, but we didn't just gain share in crackers because of Cheez-It. We also outpaced the category with the club and townhouse brands, Pop-Tarts grew consumption in the double digits and so did Rice Krispies Treats with both brands sustaining excellent momentum through the strength of effective marketing programs and incremental innovation. And while we're at it, Nutri-Grain also grew consumption in the double digits and RX continues to reaccelerate its growth as consumers go back on the move. So our North America snacks business remains very strong. Let's turn now to North America cereal on Slide Number 24. Recall that 2022 is all about recovering from last year's fire and strike. As you know, we entered the quarter with very low finished goods inventory, which obviously hampered our net sales and consumption year on year. The good news is that our first order of business in quarter one was restoring production in the four affected plants, which our team achieved and ahead of schedule. With demand holding up well and retailers anxious to restore their inventories, we were able to ship out more product in the first quarter than we had anticipated. This certainly will help us improve consumption, going forward. Slide Number 25 offers a good way to gauge our progress on restoring supply. It measures our share against our total distribution points. You can see the sharp decline in last year's fourth quarter, as retailers ran through their inventory and we were unable to partnership it. As we ramped up production during the first quarter, you can see product returning to the shells in the form of recovering TDPs and therefore share. This reflects our improving supply and is a testament to the strength of our brands and relationships with our retail partners. This sequential improvement is what we to continue to realize as we get through the first half. In fact, this positive trend has continued quite clearly in April. This will put us right on track to gradually restore commercial plans brand by brand toward full recovery in the second half. Our frozen businesses in North America are depicted on Slide Number 26. Consumption growth remained strong with mid-single digit growth on top of a mid-single digit two-year CAGR. This is good performance given that we've been capacity constrained, especially on pancakes. The even better news is that we have incremental capacity coming online in the second quarter. In our plant-based business, Morningstar farms consumption was down against the mid-teens two year CAGR comparison and the category has paused on distribution gains and household penetration gains after surging the past couple of years. We've seen some share losses, competitors have entered and expanded offerings in our segments and in many cases competing intensely on price. So in total, North America got off to a good start in the first quarter with progress on supply recovery in cereal and in market momentum elsewhere in the portfolio. Closing out North America Slide Number 27 highlights some of the exciting innovations and commercial programs we have going into the marketplace. To remind you that even though we're in an unusual supply environment, we continue to delight consumers. On the innovation front, Cheez-It puff is off to an even faster start than Snaft [ph] the platform we launched a couple of years ago. Club Crisps is also new to the market, providing a light and fresh snack that's built on the strength of our Club Crackers line. For Pop Tarts we've launched new flavors like Snicker Doodle, expanded on a simple ingredient line called Pop Tarts Simply and brought back a fan favorite Frosted Grape. And in Frozen, beyond the lookout for Eggo's new Liege-Style Waffles for on the go consumption and some exciting new varieties of Morningstar farms, including a delicious pancake wrap sausage on a stick. From a marketing standpoint, Mission Tiger is roaring back, helping kids gain better access to use sports. These are just a few examples of why we are so confident that we can sustain our snacks momentum, recover cereal and reaccelerate Frozen. Now let's discuss Europe shown on Slide Number 28. Europe had another outstanding quarter growing net sales 8% and operating profit by 28%. Even as it lapsed strong year ago growth for both metrics. While volume was down against the tough comparisons, Europe's RGM efforts continued to generate price mix growth and productivity also helped to cover costs enabling increased A&P investment. On Slide Number 29, you can see that we experienced organic net sales growth in both snacks and cereal in the first quarter, despite what were very tough comparisons on a two-year basis. In snacks, the growth is underpinned by fantastic momentum in consumption for Pringles which gains share in markets like Germany, Italy and Spain and lagged the category's double-digit growth in the UK only because of tougher comparisons. We should also point out that in portable wholesome snacks, where categories are rebounding on a return to consumer mobility, our efforts to revitalize brands like Rice Crispy Squares and Pop Tarts are starting to pay off, with share gains in markets like the UK and Italy. In cereal, assumption is moderating across the region as consumer mobility and price elasticity resumes. While we have gained share in the UK and Germany, we have seated share in other markets in part because of lapping tougher comparisons. Nevertheless, some key supported brands continue to do well as shown on this slide. A quick word about the situation in Ukraine, Russia and Ukraine represent less than 1.5% of our total company net sales, and less than 10% of our sales in Europe. We have suspended shipments and investments into Russia, which will have a direct impact on our sales and profit in Europe this year. This is incorporated into our updated guidance. Overall though, Kellogg Europe is off to a very good start to 2022, and we feel good about the business. Now let's discuss Latin America, turning to Slide Number 30. Latin America too faced notably impressed of comparisons, particularly on a two-year CAGR basis and especially on operating profit. But this business got off to a good start with year-on-year net sales growth driven by price mix growth and operating profit that declined less than we had expected. Slide Number 31 shows that our Latin American net sales growth was led by snacks. Here too, Pringles is showing impressive momentum, outpatient in the category's double-digit growth in Mexico and Brazil. In portable wholesome snacks our consumption has rebounded faster than the category in our principle markets of Mexico and Puerto Rico and cereal category consumption growth remains robust across the region and we outpace the category in key markets, However, tough comparisons and regulatory hurdles in Mexico negatively impacted our cereal net sales in the quarter. Nonetheless, our Latin America business continues to perform well. Let's finish our business review with EMEA on Slide Number 32. Quarter one featured another exceptional performance by our fastest growing region. Despite lapping a strong two-year CAGR for volume EMEA continued to leverage RGM for exceptional price realization across the region, which helped it offset the margin impact of high costs. The result was double-digit growth in both net sales and operating profit versus the prior year. Slide Number 33 shows how EMEA net sales growth was generated across all three of our product category groups in the region. Noodles was once again the largest contributor to the growth, reflecting exceptional growth by Multipro in West Africa and our continued expansion of the Kelloggs Noodles brand in markets like Egypt and South Africa. Our strong snacks growth was led by Pringles, which sustained goods consumption growth, even as it entered the quarter with low inventories coming out of last year's COVID related production restrictions. In portable wholesome snacks, our double-digit growth was strong enough to gain share in Australia and in the rest of the region. In cereal, the overall region's category has decelerated to modest growth, but we have gained share led by Australia, Korea and South Africa. So to close out of prepared remarks, let me briefly summarize with Slide Number 35. We're off to a very good start to the year. We remain right on strategy as ever focused on dependable, balanced financial delivery. We are navigating well through unprecedented cost and supply challenges and through it all, we have sustained top line momentum, both in net sales and consumption growth. This reflects the strength of our reshaped portfolio, particularly our international markets and our North America snacks and frozen businesses. It also reflects what we have done on revenue growth management in order to help cover rising costs. Put it all together and we come at to quarter one ahead of plan, which is an important benefit as we look ahead to continued uncertain market conditions. We are affirming our guidance for the year and we are increasing the cash we return to share owners. As always, I can't thank enough the talented, resourceful and persevering Kellogg employees who have made performance and our bright prospects possible. And with that, we'll open up the line for questions. Good morning, Chris. Yes. Thanks, Chris. It is a U.S. comment. I mean inventories are down really across the globe, generally speaking, because of supply shortages, bottlenecks and the like. But the big issue for us is in the U.S. and predominantly in cereal because of the fire and strike. And so we're ahead of where we plan to be. So that's great. I give a real tip of the cap to our 4 cereal plants that came back to work, came back motivated and are building inventory ahead of plan. And we appreciate that and those efforts and the leadership in the plants and the plant workers. The second quarter, you'll see accelerated commercial activity. And really in the back half of the year is when we plan to be resuming full commercial activity against our cereal portfolio. So that's why we're encouraging looking at the sequential improvement. If you look at year-over-year performance and share in U.S. cereal, clearly still down, but that's based on low inventories and lack of commercial activity. But when you look at the sequential performance of the business, our goal is each and every week to continue to build our TDPs and each and every week to continue to accelerate our share momentum and get back to where we belong because the brands are still incredibly strong, relationships with retailers continues to be very, very strong, and we're working together to get this business back to where it belongs. Yes, Jason. So I'll start, and Amit can add. We're seeing clearly elasticity still well below normal levels. So I think that's the important thing to note. But we are seeing -- when you look at 2-year CAGRs, we're starting to see the return of elasticities, which is not surprising given the level of pricing that's in the market. You're seeing it more in some of the at-home meal occasions. So cereal and frozen. We're seeing a little bit more snacking, less so. And we're incorporating that into our guidance. So we're planning on elasticities growing as pricing continues to be very elevated but still below what you would normally see prior to all these disruptions. Yes. Cody, thanks for the question. So we don't comment on prospective pricing. But I think when you look at what we've done, it's a good indication of what we'll plan for in the future. So we have -- in terms of our revenue, our net sales growth, it's virtually all price/mix, right? And that's due to obviously the incredible input cost inflation that we're seeing and the fact that productivity just simply can't cover this type of inflationary environment. We see that continuing. And so as we look forward, we're going to continue to look at productivity as the first line of defense, but we're going to be in a situation where it's not going to be enough, and we'll look at our whole revenue growth management toolkit in order to protect and preserve our margins going forward. And excuse me, that's around the world. So that's not just the United States phenomenon. I wouldn't say it benefited North America. I mean the entire decline was in Rtech only. And if you -- like we said in the prepared remarks, if you were to remove U.S. cereal, the U.S. business was -- or the North American business was actually up 3% to 4%. And so it was slightly better than we anticipated, but we anticipated it being significantly down. But we're pleased that the inventory levels are starting to replenish, and we look at the back half of the year as really being when the Rtech business starts to get back on track. But if you look at the snacks business, for example, shipments actually lag consumption in that category. No, Rob. I'd say a couple of things. First, the Russia-Ukraine impact will be a second half impact, right? So we didn't feel that effect in the first quarter, but we will feel that going forward, and that's why we incorporated that into our outlook. And the real story, to be honest with you, in the European businesses, this is 4 years on the trough that this business has been performing very, very well. It was a bit of an outsized performance, but they grew in snacks. They stabilized cereal. They grew in wholesome snacks. And when I say they grew in snacks, I mean, Pringles consumption growth has been exceptional behind gaming, messaging, soccer events, incremental innovations like Rice Fusion and Sizzlin' ]. And the team performed extremely well when it comes to revenue growth management as well. And spending was in line with what we anticipated. So it was just an excellent quarter driven by very, very good top line performance that flowed through to the bottom line. And like I said, this is 4 years now where our European business has been performing well. And I tell the team when I visit there that there's not too many businesses like ours that talk about Europe as a growth driver to their company, but it is for us, and we're very proud of the team's performance there. Well, the biggest impact to the rest of the year is, as we said, the Russia-Ukraine situation and the fact that we're not shipping into Russia. We have a Pringles business there that we've discontinued, and we're not shipping anything into Russia. But in terms of the consumer and the outlook, what I would tell you is the Rtech category, we have seen it decelerating, but the salty remains extremely strong. Our portable wholesome snacks business is really coming back as the consumer is coming back. So when we look at our categories, it's -- what you saw in the first quarter was exactly that. The Rtech slowing down, kind of flattish and salty being very strong and wholesome snacks being very strong. And inside those categories with our brands performing very well, highly differentiated, great innovations coming to market, we anticipate that continuing. And as I said to Rob, it's 4 years now that this business has reliably delivered on the top line and the bottom line. Clearly, it's a more challenging environment now. We're seeing inflation in Continental Europe. You haven't seen that in a long time. What was typically a deflationary environment has shifted. So clearly, that will have pressure on the consumer. But what we're seeing right now is, obviously, that's pervasive everywhere. And so it's not just at the grocery store. Just like in all parts of the country, it's wide ranging. And the fact that we are in the types of business that we're in is a good place to be in an environment like this. And when you have strong brands inside of that, it's an even better place to be. So we're very confident in the European performance continuing to be strong. No. I think -- I'll start there. That includes the incognito, which is a small portion of the total Morningstar Farms. In the broader question around what's happening in the category, I'd say, in effect, you can think about the pandemic having pulled forward trial penetration and buy rates. And you saw that in the first year because there was so much at-home consumption across the grocery store, and this was a new hot category. I think it jumped forward 2 years. You also saw irrational exuberance in the category and the entrant of many, many new players, which took a lot of shelf space, took a lot of trial, not always the highest quality offerings, to be honest with you. And we've seen this in many categories in the past that take off -- they have a shakeout period. And I think what you're seeing now is a bit of that hangover from the pull forward of all those various components. Morningstar Farms, that's why we're looking at the 2-year CAGR. It's still the original since 1975, a very, very strong consumer base. When we look at our brand equity scores, we know that it's still performing very, very well. And so we're bullish on the category and the brand. But I think what we're seeing is, again, just the pull forward from the pandemic and having to lap that rather exceptional year. Yes. So Pamela, what I'd say is, as I said in the prepared remarks, we're looking at sequential recovery, right? And we're not going to forecast market share when we're going to be at a certain point, but we're bound and determined to continue week after week, month after month to continue to build our TDPs, build our shelf presence, build our commercial activity, which includes displays and merchandising, so that we exit the year with great momentum close to where perhaps we were before all this occurred. And so that's essentially the way we're thinking about it. The second half has the return to commercial activity that looks much more similar to prestrike. And so that's how we're thinking about it. We're pleased about the progress to date, but we remain very aggressive in terms of making sure that we continue the progress that we've seen so far. Yes, Ken. So obviously, we're very pleased with the African performance in general, Multipro in particular. You're seeing their ability to take price is exceptional to cover rising input costs, currency and so forth. And we've mentioned many times, they've got they've got 4 decades of experience on the African continent. And their agility and ability to overcome obstacles continues to be very, very impressive. And the moat that we've built around that country in terms of our route to market with Multipro continues to be impressive. They're adding suppliers. They're adding points of distribution on a regular basis to continue to build that business. Now on the procurement front, there's clearly a lot of wheat that comes from Russia and Ukraine, and they've pivoted to all around the world to get supplies to replace that, and they've done that very effectively. And that's really across the world. And so they've got line of sight to good product production. They've got line of sight to meet our noodles forecasts for the remainder of the year and even into next year. And so I think it's down to execution. It's down to planning, and it's down to just the experience that they bring to bear in virtually everything that they do. Amit, I don't know if you want to add anything. Yes, David. So there's really no timing benefits in the first quarter. As I said, it's just a very, very good quarter that Europe delivered. Part of the mobility and return to mobility definitely benefits our portable wholesome snacks. So that's kind of a new third leg that is performing now very well. Pringles, one of the magic of Pringles is it's a very differentiated brand. Its innovation performance in Europe has been very strong. And its brand messaging and communication has been very strong. And that's allowed us to do a couple of things over the course of the last, call it, 18 to 24 months. And that breaks some magic price points that had existed in the marketplace for some time. And so there's no ceiling on -- there's no artificial ceiling on Pringles in terms of, call it, a GBP1.99 in Europe. It's burst through that. And once you do that and prove to retailers and consumers that the brand is worth that, you start to see some continuing benefits. And so I'd say, breaking magic price points because of the investments in innovation and brand marketing, the return of wholesome snacks, the stabilization of cereal, it's just -- it's been a solidly delivered plan by Europe, and that's why we have confidence ex the Ukraine-Russia terrible situation that the underlying momentum continues. Yes. So first, I'd start with saying we are not at all complacent about this, and we're not at all underestimating the challenge of rebuilding our business, but we do know a couple of things. The brands are very, very strong. So if you look at the brands that have returned to I wouldn't even say yet adequate levels of inventory, but better levels of inventory like Fruit Loops and Frosted Flakes, performing well, getting their shares back. And then brands like -- some other brands -- Rice Krispies is one where obviously was very impacted by the fire, not yet there because the inventories aren't close to where we need them to be. And so we do know that the brands are -- remain very strong. These are iconic brands that consumers love. They're important to our retail partners. And again, we don't take that for granted. But as we rebuild inventory and we put commercial activity behind these beloved brands and we get our TDPs back, then we're very confident we'll continue to improve the business and get it back to where it belongs. But again, we don't take that for granted. We've got work to do, but we know what that work is, we know how to do it, and we're doing it. Yes, Alexia. So it's about 5% of our business. And the HFSS, high fat sodium sugar content is what you're referring to. And we have -- we're building plans to overcome merchandising, restrictions and so forth for all of the brands that are affected. So we're very confident we'll be able to do that. We don't see any impact for the remainder of this year. And we remain constructively engaged despite -- despite the legal activity, we remain constructively engaged and hopeful that we'll be able to work something out with the U.K. government. But it's all incorporated in the guidance."

            "name": "Amit Banati",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve and good morning, everyone. As Steve said, we're off to a good start to 2022. We'll start with a brief summary of a quarter one financial two results on Slide Number 10. Our net sales growth came on top of similarly good growth in the year earlier quarter and is tracking ahead of our previous full year guidance. As expected, operating profit declined against last year's double-digit gain, but it should be noted that the year on year decline was entirely related to the wraparound impact to the fire end strike we experienced in 2021. Earning per share also exceeded our expectations, reflecting the better operating profit and with unfavorability in other income offset by some discrete favorable items in our tax rate. Cash flow came in ahead of plan and significant that last year. Slide Number 11, lays out the components of net sales growth in quarter one. Volume was down year on year due to lapping a strong two-year CAGR of nearly 4%, but also due to lacking inventory in certain businesses going into this year, most notably in our North America cereal business. In fact, North America's cereal volume decline represented almost half of our total companies year-on-year volume decline in the quarter. We also saw price elasticity resuming in many markets just as we have been forecasting, although still running well below historical levels. Price mix grew nearly 10% year-over-year and acceleration from recent quarters as we continue to work to offset market-driven cost inflation. This price realization is predominantly priced as we continue to implement revenue growth management actions in all four regions with a much smaller contribution coming from our mix shift towards snacks. The result was organic basis net sales growth of over 4% year on year, another strong quarterly performance that continues to exceed our long-term target. This was better than focused principally because of less price elasticity than expected, but also because of sooner than anticipated replenishment of trade inventories in North America cereal, at least some of which could be considered timing related. Foreign currency translation clipped nearly two percentage points of net sales growth in the quarter with a US dollar strengthening year-on-year against virtually all of our major currencies. Slide Number 12 shows our gross profit in dollars, as anticipated, our gross profit declined year-on-year principally because of supply disruption. The good news is that productivity and revenue growth management continued to mostly cover the market-driven cost inflation despite the latter accelerating again in the quarter. This is what we can manage and we've done a good job of it. The single largest driver of our gross profit decline was a transitory impact of the fire and strike we experienced in the second half of last year. This impact reflects not only lost sales year on year, but significant costs as well. On top of this, are the economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages that are expected to persist at least through the first half. These two factors accounted for almost all of our year-on-year decline in gross profit dollars in quarter one and about half of the margin contraction. These are transitory factors and should diminish as the year progresses. The rest of the margin contraction was related to mix. As we've discussed, our only meaningful mix headwind is the shift towards emerging markets and particularly toward our EMEA region and its Nigerian distributor business. Multipro. In Quarter One, this mix shift towards EMEA was especially pronounced. As we've often stated, this mix shift does not bother us because our growth in emerging markets and in Multipro are not cannibalizing any of our higher margin developed markets businesses, which brings us to operating profit on Slide Number 13. Despite transitory supply disruptions, our operating profit remains on an upward trajectory owing primarily to higher net sales with our supply constraint in many of our businesses, most notably in North America, cereal our advertising and promotion investment was much lower than usual in quarter one. As we discussed last quarter, this A&P investment is expected to be restored gradually across the year in line with our recovering supply. The result of our lower gross profit was a year on year decline in operating profit, which was also up against a double-digit growth comparison. Importantly though, a quarter one operating profit was still higher than that of quarter one 2020 and quarter one 2019, sustaining an upward trajectory. Turning now to our below the line items on Slide Number 14; lower debt year-on-year translated into lower interest expense, though the run up in rates during quarter one will likely create year-on-year increases in the coming quarters. Other income was negatively affected by lower pension income as expected, but also by the impact of a declining bond market on a company-owned life insurance investments. Lower net pension income will continue through the year. Our effective tax rate benefited from a couple of relatively small discrete items in quarter one, our JV earnings and minority interests collectively improved year on year reflecting the consolidation of certain Africa JVs at midyear last year and average shares outstanding decreased year-on-year, mainly reflecting the repurchases we made in 2021. We were active on buybacks during the quarter, and this will have an impact on average shares outstanding in quarter two. Let's look at our cash flow and balance sheet on Slide Number 15. Cash flow came in strongly in quarter one on the strength of higher net earnings, continued management of co-working capital and some timing of accrues and capital investment. As you can see on the chart, we stock the year well ahead of where we typically are in quarter one, aside from the unusual pandemic year of 2020. In addition, our net debt remains lower year on year. Between strong cash flow and or deleveraged balance, we feel good about our financial flexibility. This financial flexibility has given us the ability to increase the cash we return to share owners. We recently announced another increase in our dividend and in quarter one, we repurchased some 300 million of our stock. Let's now turn to the rest of the year. Our primary planning assumptions are shown on Slide Number 16. We expect to deliver sustained momentum on the top line led by our strong snacking portfolio around the world. And geographically by our emerging markets. Price mix would continue to drive our net sales growth as we try to keep up with rising costs and as we continue to assume, some combination of decelerating at home demand growth and resume price elasticity. Our market-driven cost inflation has gotten higher worsened by the war in Ukraine, and it looks like it will persist longer than originally anticipated. This has been incorporated into our outlook. From a supply disruption standpoint, we are largely past the fire and strike impact, though we will still expect bottleneck and shortages to persist at least through the first half, with disruption related to the war in Ukraine, more weighted to the second half. Meanwhile, as we mentioned, we do plan to gradually restore overhead and brand building investment across our regions as the year progresses, be it behind capabilities or resumed commercial activity behind supply constraint brands. Slide Number 17 shows how these planning assumptions translate into updated full year guidance. We are raising our forecast for organic basis net sales growth to about 4% growth versus our previous estimate of about 3%. This reflects the momentum in our business and the fact that price mix is likely to come in higher than we previously planned as we seek to cover incremental cost inflation. This higher net sales should offset the incremental pressures of accelerated cost inflation and supply disruption. As a result, we continue to focus currency-neutral adjusted basis growth of 1% to 2% in operating profit. We also continue to forecast currency neutral adjusted basis growth of 1% to 2% in earnings per share with a further reduction in other income, partially offset by the fully year flow through of quarter one, discrete tax benefits. From a phasing standpoint, the only new news since last quarter is that we got off to a better than expected start in quarter one, but that our second half will now experience more cost inflation and disruption and cost related to supply. Finally, we continue to forecast cash flow of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. This is roughly in line with our reported basis net income growth with no changes to our disciplined approach to restructuring outlays, co-working capital and capital expenditure. So in summary, we got off to a good start in quarter one, delivering solid financial results in the face of massive headwinds, and even putting us ahead of plan. Our brands continue to perform well and we have been effective at offsetting market-driven cost inflation with productivity and revenue growth management. Our cash flow generation remains strong and our balance sheet remains strong. So we feel good about our financial position and the outlook. Let me now turn it back to Steve for a review of our regions. Yes. So on inflation, I think we talked in our last call as well that we ended the year with an outlook of double-digit inflation. I think through the quarter, we saw that inflation accelerates. And I think when I look at the rest of the year, what's incorporated in our guidance is continued double-digit inflation. It's notched up by 2 to 3 points. So that's kind of what's been incorporated in our guidance. I think in hedge levels, we are almost at around 80% level of hedging. So that's where we sit. But it's important to note that this is just for traded commodities, which is about a quarter of all our costs. Yes. The only thing -- only other thing I'd add is that our outlook now for inflation goes into the second half. And so it's not moderating at the level that we thought it would. Yes. The only other thing I'd add, Jason, is that the elasticity was better than what we had expected, and that's kind of one of the factors that drove the outperformance versus our plan in quarter 1. So far, it's been better than what we had expected. Yes. I think, Jason, if you look at our quarter, right, quarter 1, our gross margins were down 280 basis points. I think the biggest driver of that was the impact -- was the wraparound impact of the fire and strike. So that, I would say, would be almost half of the of the gross margin decline in the quarter. We continue to see bottlenecks and shortages. So that continues to impact the gross margin. Our assumption is that it will continue through the first half of this year and then start moderating in the second half. So I think that's the -- that was the single biggest impact in the quarter. From a mix standpoint, again, the mix, we did see a mix impact just given the level of growth in EMEA, which grew 17% in the quarter. So that mix shift -- I would say that mix shift would continue as AMEA continues to grow faster, but it was more pronounced in quarter 1. And I think when you kind of look at the outlook for the year, what's in our guidance is an improving trend. I would expect gross margins to continue to decline in the coming quarters before bouncing back in quarter 4 when we lapped last year's fire and strike, but definitely an improving trend because the impact of the fire and strike is now behind us. And I think when you kind of look at the outlook for gross margin for the full year, I'd say sitting here today we'd probably say that it will be down around 1%. All right. So I'll start with SG&A. I think it was planned. Quarter 1 was planned. We knew that we were low on inventory in U.S. cereal. And so I think we've adjusted our spending appropriately. And so that's kind of what's played through. I think, as I mentioned, as the year goes through, we will restore our levels of advertising and commercial activity once supply picks up. So that's very much the plan. And I think from a full year standpoint, I'd say flattish SG&A on -- is kind of our outlook, excluding currency. So that's the SG&A plan for the year. I think on -- in terms of currency, yes, I mean, based on where currencies are today, we'd probably be in that same 2% to 3% range. I think we saw about a 2% impact in quarter 1, but 2% to 3% is kind of the outlook. Yes. I think it was predominantly North America cereal, and it was planned. And I think we knew that going into the year. We knew that going into the quarter. And I think the good news is production is ahead of plan. We are ramping up inventory. And so we'll be restoring commercial activity faster than planned. And I think the spending will follow that. And I think, as I mentioned earlier, from a full year standpoint, our outlook is, call it, flattish with our currency -- on a currency-neutral basis. So that -- on SG&A. So that's kind of the shape of how the spend will be through the course of the year. Alexia, I think if you were to kind of look at specifics, it was in the teens. When we started, it was probably in the mid-teens. It's moved up 2 or 3 points from there. So that's kind of the level of inflation that we're looking at. And I think in terms of the hedges, again, it obviously covers a lot of commodities. And like I said, at an overall level, we are around 80%. We have a rolling program. And so I think we keep adding on a rolling basis. So as some of the Russia-Ukraine, is it already in, some of it is in, but it will continue to bleed through, right, as we continue to add hedges through the program. We have visibility into what our '23 outlook is. And so I think that's all going in to the planning as we look at our revenue growth management plans ahead of us."

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session with publishing analysts. At this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for Kellanova. Mr. Renwick, you may begin your conference call.\nJohn Renwick: Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for a review of our fourth quarter results and a discussion of our outlook for 2024. I'm joined this morning by Steve Cahillane, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Amit Banati, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. Slide number 3 shows our forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware, certain statements made today, such as projections for Kellanova's future performance, are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the third slide of this presentation as well as to our public SEC filings. A recording of today's webcast and supporting documents will be archived for at least 90 days on the Investor page of www.kellanova.com. As always, when referring to our results and outlook, unless otherwise noted, we will be referring to them on an organic basis for net sales and on a currency-neutral adjusted basis for operating profit and earnings per share. Included in our press release, our financial results for the fourth quarter 2023 as well as the first three quarters and full years of 2023 and 2022 recasting W.K. Kellogg Co in those periods as discontinued operations in accordance with applicable accounting guidelines. These recast financials will be the basis of comparison used in the year-on-year growth rates we provide today for all items except free cash flow, which was not recast. Keep in mind that the accounting guidelines for discontinued operations are such that the recast financials for the periods prior to the spinoff include expenses related to providing transition services to WKKC such as warehousing and IT-related expenses, but they do not include the reimbursement for those expenses, which Kellanova is receiving from WKKC under a transition services agreement. For periods after the spin-off, that is from Q4 2023 on, both the expenses and the reimbursements will be included, which will impact year-on-year comparisons. This also creates a difference from the carve-out financials that you would have seen from WKKC as different accounting guidelines apply to carve-out financials. And now I'll turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Cahillane: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. It's a real pleasure to be able to present to you results for Kellanova for the first time. Allow me first to point to you to Slide number 5 and remind everyone of Kellanova's more focused, more growth-oriented portfolio and let me also remind you of our updated and sharpened strategy. This strategy appropriately called differentiate drive and deliver as shown on Slide number 6. This strengthened portfolio and sharpened strategy were in full force during our initial quarter as Kellanova. We delivered another quarter of solid results as summarized on Slide number 7. We began the quarter with our transformational spin-off, which we executed successfully from a transactional, financial and operational perspective. We did not let this transformational transaction distract us from the task at hand, delivering results. In the quarter, we delivered results for net sales, operating profit and EPS that all were better than the guidance ranges we provided back in November. Our organic net sales growth remained at a rate that is above our long-term algorithm, even in spite of challenging industry conditions marked by rising elasticities in our categories around the world. Importantly, the strength of our diverse emerging markets was again evident. We continue to restore profit margins that had been pressured by last year's soaring input costs and rampant supply impediments. And this led to operating profit growing at a rate that exceeded our long-term algorithm as well. Meantime, we delivered more free cash flow than we had anticipated further strengthening our balance sheet and financial flexibility, which was used to opportunistically accelerate share repurchases. Importantly, we have shifted our focus back towards demand generation after a few years of having to focus more on supply. And we solidified our plans and assumptions for 2024 accordingly as outlined on Slide number 8. We are affirming the 2024 guidance we gave back in August at our Day@K Investor event, underscoring the dependability we intend to continue to exhibit as Kellanova. While it could take a couple of quarters before these negative industry trends abate, we are confident that our return to a full commercial plan will gradually stabilize and improve our volume as the year progresses. Our innovation is bigger and better than last year's supply-related pullback, our highly differentiated brands are fully supported with A&P investment, and we are back to normal levels of merchandising. We are also confident in our sustained momentum in emerging markets, another point of differentiation for Kellanova. Meantime, we also expect margin expansion in all four regions in 2024. The result is an outlook for an on-algorithm net sales and operating profit growth and free cash flow generation that is strong enough to incrementally invest in future growth and future margin expansion. This investment in future growth includes incremental capital expenditures for adding much needed capacity for Pringles in our emerging markets, as we've discussed previously. But we're also investing in margin expansion, as shown on Slide number 9. Consistent with our long-term plans to optimize our global supply chain network, we have commenced two optimizations of production facilities: one in our North America frozen foods business and one in our European cereal business. These are high-return projects that require very little cash upfront and will start delivering savings by late this year. All of this is contemplated in our guidance. And even after deploying some of the savings into growth-oriented investments, particularly behind snacks and emerging markets, these actions enabled us to get to our medium-term operating profit margin of 15% by 2026, a little earlier than we had previously indicated, while also progressing on our strategy's ambition to deliver best-in-class service through agile, flexible supply chain. Our focus is also on growing the right way, and Slide number 10 shows some of the ways our Better Days Promise program manifested itself during the fourth quarter. We unveiled new more ambitious targets for Kellanova, sustained our legacy of helping our communities and link these activities to our commercial endeavors, and we continue to be recognized for our efforts. So now let me turn it over to Amit, who will walk you through our financials before I come back and discuss each of our businesses in more detail.\nAmit Banati: Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Slide Number 12 summarizes our results for the fourth quarter and full year for Kellanova. As John indicated, the year-on-year growth rates are based on recast results for the four quarters of 2022 and the first three quarters of 2023. As you can see, our results for the quarter came in above the guidance we had provided, and they complete a full year in which we maintained our focus on delivering consistent, on algorithm results even amidst the incremental work of executing the spinoff. Net sales increased by about 7% on an organic and recast basis in quarter four, featuring decelerating volume declines and price mix growth that is moderating as we lap significant revenue growth management actions in the prior year. For the full year, Kellanova's organic net sales growth was about 8%, well above our long-term growth target. Operating profit in quarter four increased by 30% on an adjusted and currency-neutral basis and comparing against a recast 2022. This was driven by the solid top line growth as well as by a restoration of our underlying gross profit margin and reimbursement for expenses related to transition services we are providing to W.K. Kellogg Company. For the full year, Kellanova's operating profit increased by 18% on the same recast basis. Even taking into account the year-over-year impact of expense reimbursement for transition services, provided to WKKC in quarter four, 2023, which did not exist in the year earlier quarter, our year-on-year growth in operating profit was still in double digits for the quarter and the year, well ahead of our long-term target. Earnings per share on an adjusted and currency-neutral basis increased by about 19% year-on-year in quarter four and by 7% year-to-date as strong operating profit performance more than covered significant headwinds from macroeconomic factors that drove up interest expense and pull down pension income. Finally, free cash flow came in higher than we had expected in quarter four, finishing the year at $968 million. Free cash flow is not recast for discontinued operations. So the decrease from last year's solely related to onetime outlays related to the spin-off and the absence of North America cereals cash flow in the fourth quarter. Now let's take a look at each metric in closer detail starting with our net sales growth on Slide Number 13. As expected, price elasticities continue to rise around the world in quarter four, putting pressure on volume though this volume, again, came in better than projected due to better performance in our emerging markets. Price/mix continued to moderate sequentially from recent quarters as expected as we lap some of our largest revenue growth management actions last year. The result was another quarter of elevated organic net sales growth, though, to be clear, about half of that came from our Africa joint ventures where substantial pricing is needed to cover devaluing currency and shipments were unusually strong. That said, even excluding that business, we sustained organic growth that was in line with our long-term target. Moving across to the nonorganic drivers of net sales, the divestiture of our Russia business, which occurred in July, clipped about a percentage point from our overall net sales growth in quarter four, just as it did in quarter three. Foreign currency translation was a headwind of about negative six percentage points in quarter four and about negative four percentage points for the full year. This reflected primarily the Nigerian Naira, which continued to devalue during the fourth quarter and was only partially offset by strength in the euro, pound sterling and Mexican peso. While we don't provide guidance on foreign exchange rates, if today's rates held for the year, we would likely experience an impact on net sales that is similar to the impact that we saw in quarter four. Now let's discuss our profit margin recovery, starting with gross profit on Slide Number 14. In quarter four, we continue to grow gross profit and restore gross profit margins. As in the previous quarters, this restoration of margins was aided by revenue growth management, productivity and improved supply and service levels. In addition, the other half of the quarter's margin expansion was driven by reimbursement of expenses related to transition services provided to WKKC, which did not exist in the year ago quarter. You\u2019ll notice that at 34% in quarter four, Kellanova's gross margin is structurally higher than Kellogg Company's margin, and it continued to come in higher than we had anticipated. We expect to continue to improve gross margin in 2024. Turning to Slide Number 15, we see that in quarter four and the full year, we also grew operating profit, driven by growth in net sales and the higher gross profit margin. Meantime, operating profit margin improved year-on-year in quarter four and the full year. Remember, the 12.3% margin you see for 2023 is recast for discontinued operations so it does not include reimbursement for transition service expenses during the first three quarters. We expect our operating profit margin to reach 14% in 2024. Moving down the income statement, Slide Number 16 shows how our adjusted basis earnings per share growth in 2023, even on a recast basis fell the year-on-year effects of macro-related headwinds within our non-operating, below-the-line items. These below-the-line pressures were expected and were experienced year-on-year in quarter four and the full year, even comparing to a recast 2022, and for all the reasons we have discussed previously. Foreign currency translation was modestly positive to earnings per share in 2023, including quarter four as strength in European and Mexican currencies more than offset what is a relatively small impact from Nigeria naira at the EPS level. Recall that due to our ownership structure, while the naira had a large impact on net sales its impact on operating profit and EPS is much smaller. Turning to Slide number 17. We are pleased with our cash flow generation and balance sheet. Noting that we have not recast free cash flow for discontinued items, we finished 2023 only modestly below 2022. Despite the absence of the spun-off North America cereal cash flows for a quarter, and despite one-time cash outlays related to the spin-off. In fact, the combination of these spin-off factors amounted to about $300 million of negative impact. If you added that back, you can see that our free cash flow would have come in above 2022 levels. Our balance sheet after the transfer of net debt to WKKC remains solid with debt leverage remaining well below our targeted ratio of net debt to trailing EBITDA of 3x. Now let's discuss our 2024 guidance shown on Slide number 18. The 2023 base is recast for discontinued operations. And because these figures may differ from WKKC carve-out figures and our internal management figures, we've chosen to continue to provide you with absolute dollar guidance for operating profit and earnings per share in 2024. After all, 2024 is what is really important as it is the first full year in our current P&L structure. Let's go through each metric. For net sales, we affirm our guidance for growth within our long-term targeted range, specifically calling for a 3% growth or better in 2024. Across most of our businesses, price mix growth will moderate as we continue to lap prior actions and industry-wide elasticities will fade gradually during the year. The exception is Nigeria where currency influence pricing actions will likely continue, which we assume produce meaningful elasticity impact on volume. Organic growth, of course, excludes currency translation, which based on today's exchange rates, would be a headwind of 5% to 6%. For adjusted basis operating profit, we continue to provide absolute dollar guidance because year-on-year growth rate can be impacted by discontinued operations accounting. We are affirming the range of $1.85 billion to $1.9 billion. This incorporates a negative impact from currency translation, which based on today's exchange rates, would be approximately 2%, versus recast 2023 figures, this implies growth in operating profit in the mid-teens. After taking into account the year-over-year impact of expense reimbursement for transition services provided to WKKC for four quarters in 2024 versus only in the fourth quarter in 2023, this year-on-year growth is still in the mid single-digits, solidly on our long-term target. Our guidance implies continued margin expansion as an improving gross profit margin more than offsets a strong increase in brand investment. We expect to reach a 14% operating margin in 2024. Adjusted basis, earnings per share is still expected to be in the range of $3.55 to $3.65. We make no change to our previously communicated expectation for an increase in our effective tax rate to 23%. Our outlook for interest expense is about $310 million and we expect other income to be around $50 million. And we are affirming our outlook for free cash flow of approximately $1 billion with year-on-year growth driven by operating profit partially offset by capital expenditure temporarily elevated for expanded Pringles capacity in emerging markets and modest cash outlays related to our two network optimization projects. These network optimization projects are addressed on Slide number 19. At our Day@K Investor event in August, we cited network optimization as one of the drivers of our margin expansion, and we are now ready to discuss specific initiatives. The two projects we are announcing today are both high return projects. Only about half of the project's upfront costs are cash even before asset sales and the projects collectively become cash neutral by 2025. In 2024, specifically, upfront costs will amount to about $160 million with less than $40 million of that in cash, and this has been incorporated into our cash flow guidance. Savings for the project start very quickly with a small portion of the overall $75 million coming as soon as the second half of 2024. And this too is incorporated into our guidance. In fact, this is a contributor to our operating profit margin expanding to 14% this year, as implied by our operating profit guidance. Importantly, with this announcement, we can also now be more specific about the timing of our medium-term goal of a 15% operating margin. We expect to reach that margin in 2026. So let's summarize our financial condition on Slide number 20. In what was our debut quarter as Kellanova, our fourth quarter results came in as guided from net sales to earnings per share. The business remains in good shape with margin restoration proceeding ahead of pace and volume performance on a path of gradual improvement. Consequently, we have affirmed our guidance for 2024, even amidst challenging industry and macroeconomic conditions. Our medium-term goal of attaining a 15% operating profit margin has been accelerated to 2026 as ongoing margin expansion drivers are now augmented by network optimization initiatives, which get started this year subject to consultation. And we continue to generate strong free cash flow that, along with our deleveraged balance sheet gives us financial flexibility. This flexibility has been on display in the form of opportunistic share buybacks during quarter four and in our decision to elevate capital investment to expand capacity for our rapidly growing Pringles business. So we enter 2024 in a strong financial condition. Let me now turn it back to Steve for a run-through of our businesses around the world.\nSteve Cahillane: Thanks, Amit. Slide number 22 splits our portfolio into category groups to help remind you of their relative sizes and growth rates. This view shows you how much each category group contributed to our strong organic net sales growth in the quarter and for the full year. Now let\u2019s review each of our regions, which are our reporting segments. We\u2019ll start with Kellanova North America and Slide number 23. North America\u2019s fourth quarter results continued to show the impact of rising elasticities across all of our categories. Recall that we entered 2023 with low service levels due to economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages, and therefore we elected to launch less innovation and to return to merchandising only after we were strongly confident that service levels had returned to normal levels. This, in conjunction with category elasticity, suddenly and rapidly rising, negatively impacted our volumes, particularly in the second half. Despite lapping an unusually strong year earlier period, North America\u2019s operating profit grew strongly year-on-year in the fourth quarter. Even accounting for the reimbursement of expenses related to transition services provided to WKKC in this year\u2019s quarter four, North America\u2019s operating profit grew in the mid-single digits year-on-year, continuing to restore underlying gross profit margin and operating profit margin by more than projected. So in spite of slowing categories and amidst the organization undergoing significant change related to the spin-off, North America again delivered financially. Within its key category groups, we can see the deceleration in top line growth caused by the rising elasticities. Slide number 24 shows our North America snacks business, which experienced slowing category growth rates during the year. Volume growth rates in our categories did not worsen in the fourth quarter, though elasticities continued to edge higher. We continued to feel the impact of less innovation year-on-year, particularly in crackers, and this will be addressed in 2024 when we return to a full innovation launch calendar. And we did see year-on-year increases in display activity and our return to merchandising and improving quality of displays will continue to gain traction as we head into the new year. It was a similar story in frozen foods shown on Slide number 25. Along with the frozen breakfast category, Eggo\u2019s consumption turned to a decline in the fourth quarter on rising elasticities. Morningstar Farms continued to gain share, but in a declining veg, vegan category. We believe these conditions are transitory for both categories and expect better performance in 2024. So let\u2019s talk about what to expect from North America in 2024, indicated on Slide number 26. First with supply impediments well behind us, we are returning to full commercial activity in 2024. This starts with a full slate of innovation launches and it includes a full year of robust merchandising and display activity. We will also continue to support our focus brands with increased brand building investment. The results should be improved in market performance and a gradual return to volume growth. And if you have been watching the Pop Tarts bowl and Cheez-It bowl, as well as the upcoming Pringles activation for Sunday\u2019s big game are good examples of how we plan to show up in 2024. Now let\u2019s turn to Kellanova Europe and Slide number 27. Here we finished the year with another strong quarter, yet again delivering organic net sales growth on top of prior year growth. In a market that is extremely price sensitive, we were again able to realize double-digit price mix growth through effective revenue growth management actions though elasticities did rise, impacting volume. Our organic net sales growth was 10% in the quarter and 9% for the full year. Europe delivered strong operating profit growth in the fourth quarter and full year. Granted, this was lapping a sharp year ago decline, but it did feature strong top line growth and better margin recovery than expected, getting its operating profit margin back to flat for the full year. On Slide number 28, you can see that snacks, which represent over half of our sales in Kellanova Europe, continued to lead our growth in this region. Our double-digit organic growth in net sales both in the quarter and for the full year was across all of our major sub regions. Revenue growth management actions drove the growth while volume declines remained relatively modest. The salty snacks category has slowed but remained in high-single digit growth across key markets and Pringles in the fourth quarter was tracking the gain share led by the UK and Spain. In portable wholesome snacks, we have managed to outpace the category in the UK and Italy. In cereals shown on Slide number 29, you can see that we grew net sales organically in the quarter. This too was led by revenue growth management actions, while elasticities have been running higher in this category than in our snacks categories. We finished 2023 with organic net sales growth of about 1%. Slide number 30 points to some elements to watch for in Europe in 2024. We expect to deliver a 7th consecutive year of organic growth. The growth will be led by snacks with Pringles continuing to be supported with innovation and brand building and portable wholesome snacks in key markets, notably Pop Tarts and Rice Krispies Squares. We\u2019re also excited about launching Cheez-It in key European markets in the second half. In cereal, our focus will be on optimizing our cereal portfolio in conjunction with the manufacturing network optimization that we\u2019re commencing this year. Now let\u2019s look at our emerging markets regions, starting with Latin America on Slide number 31. In the fourth quarter, Latin America\u2019s net sales grew 5% on an organic and recast basis, with volume declines moderating even in spite of sizable impact from our SKU rationalization and price pack architecture initiatives. The region finished the year with strong 8% organic net sales growth. Operating profit declined in the fourth quarter against a substantial year earlier gain, but despite some incremental investments and transitory cost pressures, it finished the full year with 8% growth on an adjusted and currency neutral basis. Slide number 32 shows that our snack sales were flat on an organic basis in the fourth quarter, comparing against a notably strong year earlier period. Pringles continued to perform well. End market data show sustained double-digit category growth for our major salty snacks markets, with Pringles gaining share in Brazil and holding share in Mexico. And we continue to outpace the portable wholesome snacks category in Mexico, though we did see rising elasticities in cookies in Brazil. Our Latin America snacks business finished the full year with 7% organic net sales growth. In Latin America cereals shown on Slide number 33, our organic net sales growth was strong in the quarter and for the full year. Specifically, sales grew 10% in the quarter and finished the full year with 9% growth. Cereal category consumption growth has held up in the mid to high-single digits across much of the region and we gained share in Mexico. As we look to 2024, a few things to watch for in Latin America are shown on Slide number 34. We expect a seven straight year of organic net sales growth. The growth should be led by snacks, particularly behind Pringles innovation and distribution expansion, and we also expect good growth in cereal. Margins should improve, reflecting price pack architecture and other RGM initiatives and operating efficiencies, as well as moderating input cost pressures. Slide number 35 shows the financial performance of our EMEA region. This region sustained its strong momentum in the fourth quarter when organic net sales growth reaccelerated to 22% on a combination of price mix growth and volume growth led by Africa. For the full year, our organic net sales growth was 17%. Now, obviously a large portion of this currency neutral growth came from Nigeria, where currency devaluation necessitated significant pricing actions. Nevertheless, the rest of EMEA posted solid growth in the quarter as well. Margins continued to recover year-on-year and operating profit grew 25% in the quarter on an adjusted and currency neutral basis in spite of substantially higher brand investment and despite lapping strong prior year growth, its operating profit increased by 20% for the full year. Within EMEA, we see on Slide number 36 that snacks grew organically at a double-digit pace in the fourth quarter and for the full year. This growth was led by Pringles in emerging markets across Asia, Africa and the Middle East, as well as in more developed markets like Australia, Korea and Japan. Pringles continued to gain share overall, principally due to outperformance in Thailand, Australia and Japan. In cereal shown on Slide number 37, we sustained organic growth, posting 4% growth in the fourth quarter and 6% growth for the full year. This was led by emerging markets in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. And we finish with noodles and other shown on Slide number 38. Revenue growth management actions continued to be taken in Nigeria as we try to keep up with weakened currencies, but volume also grew in the double digits in the fourth quarter, reflecting the strength of our brands and our execution as well as timing of shipments. Meanwhile, we also continued to expand our Kellogg's noodles business outside of Nigeria and this also contributed to our volume growth in the quarter. We expect EMEA to sustain momentum into 2024, as discussed on Slide number 39. To deliver the region's 17 straight year of organic net sales growth, we expect to see strong growth if moderating from 2023 rates in noodles and other. We expect to see sustained momentum in snacks led by Pringles, and we expect to sustain growth in cereal led by emerging markets. Margin expansion should continue led by our businesses outside of Nigeria. In those markets, input cost pressures are finally moderating and productivity and operating leverage continue to contribute positively. So let me summarize with Slide number 41. Simply put, the Kellanova era is off to a good start. We've executed well the spinoff and the post-spinoff operations, including transition services and we delivered our initial quarter ahead of our expectations. We're now shifting back to a focus on demand generation after a few years of supply focus. We're very excited about our 2024 commercial plans, which feature a return to a full complement of innovation, brand building, merchandising, as well as sustaining momentum and scale building in our emerging markets. We're also pleased with our progress and plans for restoring and expanding profit margins, which has proceeded faster than we had anticipated. Our outlook for 2024, first shared with you as far back as last August remains intact, calling for another year of on algorithm sales and profit growth. And we're not sitting still. We're already creating the future. For instance, we are adding much needed capacity for Pringles in emerging markets. The international expansion of Cheez-It continues with launches coming in Europe, and we are commencing network optimization initiatives that will both expand margins and fuel growth investments. In sum, we are on track and ready to deliver as Kellanova and the future certainly is bright. Of course, none of this would be possible without the grit and skill of our supremely talented Kellanova employees, all of whom are as determined as ever to differentiate, drive and deliver. And now, we'd be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session with publishing analysts. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question for today comes from Peter Galbo of Bank of America. Peter, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nPeter Galbo: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just first a comment. Hopefully, the edible Pop Tarts is going to make his way down to CAGNY. I think a lot of people would enjoy that.\nSteve Cahillane: Peter, he didn't survive the bowl game, in case you weren't watching.\nPeter Galbo: We'll have to find another one, Steve. Amit, just to clarify your comments on the guidance understanding organic sales, the plus three, and I think you said it, current rates, a headwind of 5% to 6% on top line from FX. The operating profit range, though, the dollar range. Did I hear you correctly that that included a 2 point hit or is that in addition. So we should be taking that into consideration on the dollar range? Thanks very much.\nAmit Banati: Yes. Peter, that does include the \u2013 operating profit does include the currency headwind, so just confirming that. Like I mentioned, it's approximately around 2% at today's rates. So that 2% is built into the dollar numbers that we've given.\nPeter Galbo: Great. And that's the same on EPS as well, the 2%.\nAmit Banati: Yes.\nPeter Galbo: Perfect. Okay. Thanks very much.\nAmit Banati: EPS is probably slightly lesser.\nPeter Galbo: Yes. Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Moskow of TD Cowen. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRobert Moskow: Hey, thank you for the question. As Steve, you called out a return to stronger innovation in North America and normal merchandising activity. Can you give us a sense of the phasing throughout the year like the retail tracking data looks very, very weak in the U.S. Is that due to a comparison to the prior year? Or does it just going to take a while for your innovation and merchandising to get you back to your normal growth rate?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. It\u2019s going to \u2013 Rob, thanks for the question. It\u2019s going to be throughout the year. Really, we started with displays coming back to prior years, better than prior year in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, we\u2019re going to see the quality of those displays improving. That will continue into the second quarter as well. And just to remind you, 2023 was a year of pullback on innovation, culling of SKUs, clearly focused on supply and making sure that we could have that supply in the market. In the U.S., though, for example, we\u2019ve got Pringles Harvest Blends, which we brought in the second half of 2023. We\u2019ve got Cheez-It innovations, Cheez-It Crunchy, which is hitting now. We\u2019ve got Pop-Tarts crunchy poppers. We\u2019ve got innovations around Nutri-Grain. We\u2019ve got a Rice Krispies Treats with peanut butter. We\u2019ve just got many more innovations than we\u2019ve had in prior years, and that will roll throughout the year. We\u2019ve also got distribution growing where it had been declining. So you should see momentum growing really starting now and picking up all through the year. And that gives us really good confidence in the top-line guide that we gave. The other thing I\u2019d add, Rob, is a higher brand building investment as well, which we phased into the first half of this year as well to really drive that quality to display and that quality merchandising.\nRobert Moskow: So when do you think we\u2019ll see like the top-line growth really show up in the retail tracking? Is it going to be like third quarter kind of thing? Or could it happen as early as 2Q?\nSteve Cahillane: There\u2019s not really an inflection point per se. I think you\u2019re going to see a cumulative improvement with probably the third quarter being the one where it be most notable and then we\u2019ll exit the year with lots of momentum. So it will be cumulative throughout the year and growing from the second into the third quarter.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo. Chris, your line is now open and please go ahead.\nChris Carey: Hi good morning and thank you for the question. So, I just wanted to touch on this innovation and merchandising comment again and just trying to contextualize 2023. Can you maybe just help understand 2023 market share performance between say, some of your brand \u2013 or some of your extension innovations, say, your base business relative to innovations that you had done through the year that perhaps received less support or, or less merchandising. Really just trying to understand is it the core were \u2013 where you\u2019re starting to see some of the share erosion? Or was it some of the newer products that you had launched in 2023 that perhaps didn\u2019t get as much support and going into 2024, those are really the opportunities for you to kind of recapture some of this relative share momentum.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. Thanks, Chris. So it really \u2013 it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s much less the core than it is some of the innovations that we really didn\u2019t support with quality display merchandising. And so if you look at Cheez-It, the Snap\u2019d and Puff\u2019d, and if you were to look at the cases on display for those dramatically down as we focused on the core supply. And we have owned it. We returned to merchandising later than our competitors. We were more conservative when it came to that merchandising overly focused on making sure that we had high 90s fill rates before we return to merchandising. So that\u2019s what you see in the share. We don\u2019t see any deterioration in our brand health. In fact, we see our brand health really at very high watermarks across Cheez-It, Pringles, Pop-Tarts, Rice Krispies Treats. And so that gives us the confidence to talk about the quality of merchandising returning and our share performance improving as we go throughout 2024, again, coupled with more brand investments in the first half of the year. When you look at our brand investment, we never \u2013 we didn\u2019t pull back in 2023. We publish advertising only on a full year basis. You\u2019ll see advertising up in 2023, that\u2019s going to continue into 2024.\nChris Carey: Okay. So really, we should be looking at the strength of additional innovation, adding to market share performance with maybe the base business being a little bit of an uplift as well. Okay, and then\u2026\nSteve Cahillane: Yes, that\u2019s right, because I mean, the comparisons are going to be against the year where we really didn\u2019t innovate and now we\u2019re getting back to kind of pre-COVID levels of innovation.\nChris Carey: Right, right. Okay. And then just from a competitive standpoint, can you maybe just give any context for what you\u2019re seeing in the environment from a pricing and promotion standpoint. And then I think one of the categories where promotion \u2013 or excuse me, competitive activity is especially what it\u2019s been on the Eggo business. So maybe you can just provide a high level thoughts on competition and maybe just drill down on that specific business? Thanks.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. So you\u2019re probably asking about the U.S., the frequency of promotions continues to return to pre-pandemic levels, so 2019 levels. The depth of those promotions is really kind of back to approaching those levels off a higher base. And so I\u2019d say the whole market is pretty benign and stable. You don\u2019t see \u2013 I\u2019ve heard some of the noise around because volumes are down, is there going to be high levels of discounting and increased frequency of promotion. We\u2019re not really seeing that. For us, we\u2019re getting \u2013 we\u2019re trying to get back to the pre-2019 levels, as I\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times now in terms of frequency to drive quality promotional displays. But not seeing anything other than that really.\nChris Carey: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Palmer of Citi. Tom, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nTom Palmer: Good morning and thanks for the question. Wanted to maybe just kick off on operating profit. At the Investor Day, you laid out some dollar expectations by segment. Obviously, several months have passed and some segments have maybe done better or tracking better than you\u2019d anticipated and some maybe not quite so maybe just an update there. Are there any real changes as I think \u2013 as we think about kind of the operating profit distribution across those segments versus what you had laid out?\nAmit Banati: Yes. At the Day at K, we had kind of given you the absolute dollar guidance just to kind of help set up your models. I think we don\u2019t intend to provide regional guidance going forward on an ongoing basis. But that said, I would say that all the regions for 2024, we\u2019d expect them to be within their long-term algorithms growth rates that we had shared at Day at K.\nTom Palmer: Okay, thank you. And then on the reorganization announcement today for the frozen and cereal businesses, what drove the decision to make these changes? I mean, presumably neither is linked directly to the cereal spin off, but was the timing at all related to kind of increased bandwidth now that the spin has been wrapped up?\nSteve Cahillane: There\u2019s a little bit of that, but really it\u2019s more. If you think about what we\u2019ve been through as an industry focused on supply, focused on getting through the pandemic, focused on bottlenecks and shortages, the ability to really dedicate resources towards effectiveness programs and efficiency programs like this was challenging. And so we\u2019re through that right now, and we see good opportunities in the frozen business. So we\u2019ll be closing a plant and moving production to our more efficient plants in the UK, subject to consultation. We\u2019ve got our Manchester plant, which is a very large plant, which is underutilized. We can move that production into two facilities. So straightforward programs in terms of the type of efficiencies they\u2019ll drive. We\u2019re confident that they\u2019re terrific programs. But it\u2019s really a matter of having the bandwidth pre or post pandemic, post bottlenecks and shortages that will allow us to ongoing look for programs like this to continue to drive effectiveness and efficiency.\nTom Palmer: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Dickerson of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRob Dickerson: Great. Thanks a lot. It\u2019s just \u2013 first question, I heard you mention increased global distribution in certain power brands, let\u2019s call them, some in Europe this year, maybe in some other cities in Asia. Could you just kind of briefly discuss, add some color as to like what could be the opportunity there with a brand like Cheez-It and kind of what the timing is of that non-U.S. distribution?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes, Rob. We get asked a lot, why is Cheez-It primarily a U.S. brand? Why not expand it 10 years ago? And I think that\u2019s a fair question. The company was very busy expanding Pringles around the world. And you see, obviously now it\u2019s a global brand growing all around the world, recognized everywhere. And that\u2019s the long-term ambition for something like Cheez-It, which is the next out of the gate. But you start with Cheese [ph]. And we launched in Canada, we launched in Brazil and Mexico, and this year, the back half of the year, we\u2019ll be launching in major markets in Europe. And so it\u2019s a long-term play. It\u2019s in our guidance, it\u2019s not really \u2013 it\u2019s not going to be a material driver of top line. But five years from now, it\u2019s going to be a much bigger brand internationally than it is today. And that\u2019s really the plan. We learned from the Canada launch. We applied those learnings to Brazil, then to Mexico, and we\u2019ve got a terrific plan for the back half of the year in Europe. And so it\u2019s a long-term play. Then you look at the rest of our portfolio. Rice Krispies Treats is already a multi-country brand, growing nicely in Europe, growing nicely in Australia and New Zealand. You look at Pop-Tarts, there\u2019s potentially room for that to be an international brand down the road. So we look at our portfolio, we like what we see in terms of international expansion, but we\u2019re going to do it in a very prudent and pragmatic and practical way to drive long-term growth.\nRob Dickerson: All right. Super. And then maybe just a very simple, quick follow-up. I heard you say, expect gross margin to improve for the year. Could you just maybe provide us with kind of how you\u2019re viewing the cost side of the equation, COGS inputs is that deflationary? And then kind of given some of the commentary around maybe more positive volumes in the back half, should we be expecting also maybe a little bit better gross margin back half year-over-year relative to the first half year-over-year? Thanks.\nAmit Banati: Gross margins have come in better than expected, and so I think the supply chain is performing well. We\u2019re seeing costs come out of the supply chain that had gone in the last couple of years. In quarter four, first quarter of Kellanova, our gross margin came in at 34%, and we\u2019d expect that in 2024, we\u2019d be approaching 35%. So that\u2019s kind of the outlook for the year. So pleased with the progress that we are making, and certainly the progress that we\u2019re making the gross margins is ahead of what we had shared at Day at K. That\u2019s allowed us to continue to be on our guidance on an operating profit basis. I think in terms of the drivers, you\u2019ll obviously have the benefit of wraparound pricing and some continued revenue growth management into this year. The input costs, I would say deflationary on commodities, a couple of commodities continue to be inflationary, net-net slightly deflationary. You look at labor and other parts of our supply chain where there is inflation overall, I'd say costs are broadly neutral. So that combination should drive continued progress on gross margin. And I think it'll be fairly balanced across the quarters. We'd expect our A&P to be more front loaded as we get back to full innovation. But the gross margin progress should be fairly balanced across the quarters.\nRob Dickerson: All right, super. That's great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Max Gumport of BNP Paribas. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMax Gumport: Hey. Thanks for the question. With regard to the comment about all regions being within their long-term algo in 2024. Was that just on operating profit or does that apply to organic net sales, too?\nAmit Banati: I think to organic net sales as well.\nMax Gumport: Okay. And then as a follow-up, so for North America that would be low-single digits to mid-single digits. Can you just walk through the drivers of what's getting North America to organic sales growth in 2024, particularly given the decline we just saw in 4Q and the weakness that was addressed in the scanner trends that we're seeing? Thanks.\nAmit Banati: Yes. North America. I'll just start. North America will probably be towards the low end of that range, so probably more low-single digit. But as Steve elaborated, its return to merchandising, innovation, all of that should result in low-single digit growth in North America.\nMax Gumport: Got it. And then last one for me. The shipment timing in EMEA that you called out, should we expect that to reverse at all in 1Q? And can you just go over what happened there exactly in terms of the African util shipment benefit? Thanks.\nAmit Banati: Yes. So a couple of things driving the strong volume growth in EMEA, and it was all in Africa JVs. One is we are expanding our noodles business across the continent in South Africa as well as in Egypt. So we're seeing strong volume growth. And that expansion is seeing good traction in terms of share and leading share positions in South Africa as well as in Egypt. So that's a source of volume growth, and that will continue in 2024. I think in Nigeria specifically, we've had to take a lot of pricing given what's happened with the currency and the elasticities have been pretty good and better than expected. There has been some ordering by our customers at older prices. So you're seeing acceleration of the orders to take benefit of the oil pricing. And in an environment where you're taking successive price increases, you kind of see that timing of shipments play through. Hard to kind of predict when that would unwind because as you know, the currency is devalued further in January, and we'd be taking further pricing. But we'd expect that to adjust during the course of 2024.\nMax Gumport: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you and good morning.\nAmit Banati: Good morning, Michael.\nMichael Lavery: Just wanted to start on margins. On Slide 19 you show the progression to the 15%. But the starting point for 2023, you have at 12%. That similar slide at Investor Day was at 13%, I guess just first, was \u2013 is that just straining the costs from the recast because I think WK Kellogg's margins would have been lower. So is it straining costs that drive that? Or is there something else that pushed the starting point down? And then conversely with obviously you being just as confident or more in getting to the 15% and maybe sooner is the network optimization, the key piece of that? Or are there other puts and takes we should keep in mind as well?\nAmit Banati: Yes. So just on the 12% versus the 13% at Day@K, they are on a different basis. So the 12% that you see right now is on the discontinued operations basis, which is \u2013 we've now done that work, and that's what we'll be reporting against. The 13%, which we had given at Day@K was an internal management estimate, and really the difference is the 12% does not include reimbursement for the first nine months, the TSA reimbursements for services that we're providing to WKKC, that's the way the discontinued operations accounting works. So that's really the difference between the 12% and the 13%. And I think, like I said, we expect in 2024 to be at 14% margin, so very pleased with that, obviously. And I think that's structurally higher than where we were as Kellogg's. And I think it's just a proof point of higher growth and higher profit portfolio that we have in Kellanova. And then I think to our confidence in getting to the 15% margin by 2026, yes, the network optimization projects are a contributing factor. And we'll continue to look at further opportunities but all the other drivers, advantage brands, our Top 5 brands have higher margins. They are 50% of our sales. We'd expect them to grow faster, scale in emerging markets, getting back to a full productivity program in our supply chain, some continued revenue growth management. All of those would also be contributing factors to get to that 15%.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Great. And you mentioned the Finsar services agreement as a key piece of how to think about 2024, EBIT. Can you give us a sense of how much that's got a fixed component versus variable? Or just a little bit of how that might be structured?\nAmit Banati: Yes. So it's about $40 million to $50 million a quarter, right? So it will flow through all of 2024. I think as we stop providing those services to WKKC and as WKKC contracts for those services directly, those costs will drop off from Kellanova and the reimbursement will drop off as well. So the vast majority, as this thing kind of concludes, right, as we step down from the TSAs, we'd expect the cost to stop and the reimbursement to stop. I mean, I think a good example of that is warehousing. Right now, the warehousing, we are providing the warehousing. So we are incurring the costs and then WKKC is reimbursing that to us. Once the TSA is done, they'll have their own warehousing and they'll pay for the warehousing cost directly. So the cost will stop, the reimbursement will stop. Is it a 100% 1:1? No. But I think the vast majority of that is variable. There is a small fixed element. And I think we've got plans to address that, and that's included in the 15% by size target?\nMichael Lavery: That's really helpful color. I just wanted to make sure I understand it. When you were talking about the $1,850 to $1,900 EBIT guide and the comparisons that would fall in that \u2013 it sounds like some of the TSA drove, I think you said on a mid-teens growth rate, where without that, it'd be about mid-single digit. So is that 40 to 50, is there margin on that? Or how does it contribute to EBIT if it's just a reimbursement?\nAmit Banati: No, I think it's just timing because the growth rate \u2013 so when you look at 2024, right, we are getting reimbursement for all four quarters. In 2023, we got reimbursement only in quarter four because that was when the spin happened. So the reason why it's in the teens growth rate is in 2024, you've got four quarters in 2023, you've got one quarter. So it's purely because of the way the timing of the spin and the difference coming from there.\nMichael Lavery: And a portion of the comparison in the recast numbers not have. Okay, that's perfect. Thank you so much.\nAmit Banati: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. \nKen Goldman: Hi, thank you. I just wanted to make sure 100% because I think I'm still getting some questions about this. And you mentioned, Amit, that the operating profit number, the one -- the $1,850 to $1,900 does include the headwind of 2% from FX. In the press release, it does say though that these impacts and you're talking about mark-to-market adjustments and foreign currency translation are not included in the guidance provided. Am I just misinterpreting one of those? Or they seem to be in content with each other, but I'm sure I'm just missing something?\nJohn Renwick: Yes, Ken, sorry, it's just that our guidance is typically on growth rates, which are currency neutral. So the table just has that always, but we've elected to go with absolute dollars just to help you model, so ignore the labeling. There is a little bit of that currency impact that Amit talked about in those absolute figures.\nKen Goldman: Perfect. Thank you for that clarification. And then not to harp too much on the reimbursements, but \u2013 is it \u2013 and I know you're not going to talk explicitly about 2025 yet, but it would seem that if you're getting a, I don't know, roughly $140 million benefit in 2024, that some of that kind of goes away because you didn't have \u2013 and again, it's not exactly maybe that much, it could depend on the timing of everything. But is it fair to say you'll have some kind of headwind in 2025 as those roll off. Again, with the caveat that it's too early to really discuss specifics.\nAmit Banati: Yes. I think there are costs which we are getting reimbursed. So I wouldn't characterize it as a benefit. We're incurring the cost on behalf of WKKC as part of the services we are providing them, and they are reimbursing us for those expenses that we are incurring. We would expect those expenses to drop off. And there's no markup on the service \u2013 so we would expect those expenses to drop off and then the reimbursement to drop off now is it a one-to-one? Not completely, but I'd say the vast majority of those \u2013 and I think like I mentioned in the warehouse example, that warehouse right now, we are paying for it, and we get reimbursement. Once they drop off, they'll pay for it directly.\nKen Goldman: No, I get that. I think \u2013 and I'll ask this off-line. I think I'm more asking about the growth percentage. I'll ask it offline. I know \u2013 what type of clarification. Thank you. \nAmit Banati: The growth percentage is related to the timing.\nKen Goldman: Yes. No I get it. I'll ask later. It's not worth holding it up the call for it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now pass back to John Renwick for any concluding remarks.\nJohn Renwick: Okay. Well, that is up to 10:30. If you do have follow-up questions, please do not hesitate to call us. And thank you everyone, for your interest.\nOperator: Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. It's a real pleasure to be able to present to you results for Kellanova for the first time. Allow me first to point to you to Slide number 5 and remind everyone of Kellanova's more focused, more growth-oriented portfolio and let me also remind you of our updated and sharpened strategy. This strategy appropriately called differentiate drive and deliver as shown on Slide number 6. This strengthened portfolio and sharpened strategy were in full force during our initial quarter as Kellanova. We delivered another quarter of solid results as summarized on Slide number 7. We began the quarter with our transformational spin-off, which we executed successfully from a transactional, financial and operational perspective. We did not let this transformational transaction distract us from the task at hand, delivering results. In the quarter, we delivered results for net sales, operating profit and EPS that all were better than the guidance ranges we provided back in November. Our organic net sales growth remained at a rate that is above our long-term algorithm, even in spite of challenging industry conditions marked by rising elasticities in our categories around the world. Importantly, the strength of our diverse emerging markets was again evident. We continue to restore profit margins that had been pressured by last year's soaring input costs and rampant supply impediments. And this led to operating profit growing at a rate that exceeded our long-term algorithm as well. Meantime, we delivered more free cash flow than we had anticipated further strengthening our balance sheet and financial flexibility, which was used to opportunistically accelerate share repurchases. Importantly, we have shifted our focus back towards demand generation after a few years of having to focus more on supply. And we solidified our plans and assumptions for 2024 accordingly as outlined on Slide number 8. We are affirming the 2024 guidance we gave back in August at our Day@K Investor event, underscoring the dependability we intend to continue to exhibit as Kellanova. While it could take a couple of quarters before these negative industry trends abate, we are confident that our return to a full commercial plan will gradually stabilize and improve our volume as the year progresses. Our innovation is bigger and better than last year's supply-related pullback, our highly differentiated brands are fully supported with A&P investment, and we are back to normal levels of merchandising. We are also confident in our sustained momentum in emerging markets, another point of differentiation for Kellanova. Meantime, we also expect margin expansion in all four regions in 2024. The result is an outlook for an on-algorithm net sales and operating profit growth and free cash flow generation that is strong enough to incrementally invest in future growth and future margin expansion. This investment in future growth includes incremental capital expenditures for adding much needed capacity for Pringles in our emerging markets, as we've discussed previously. But we're also investing in margin expansion, as shown on Slide number 9. Consistent with our long-term plans to optimize our global supply chain network, we have commenced two optimizations of production facilities: one in our North America frozen foods business and one in our European cereal business. These are high-return projects that require very little cash upfront and will start delivering savings by late this year. All of this is contemplated in our guidance. And even after deploying some of the savings into growth-oriented investments, particularly behind snacks and emerging markets, these actions enabled us to get to our medium-term operating profit margin of 15% by 2026, a little earlier than we had previously indicated, while also progressing on our strategy's ambition to deliver best-in-class service through agile, flexible supply chain. Our focus is also on growing the right way, and Slide number 10 shows some of the ways our Better Days Promise program manifested itself during the fourth quarter. We unveiled new more ambitious targets for Kellanova, sustained our legacy of helping our communities and link these activities to our commercial endeavors, and we continue to be recognized for our efforts. So now let me turn it over to Amit, who will walk you through our financials before I come back and discuss each of our businesses in more detail. Thanks, Amit. Slide number 22 splits our portfolio into category groups to help remind you of their relative sizes and growth rates. This view shows you how much each category group contributed to our strong organic net sales growth in the quarter and for the full year. Now let's review each of our regions, which are our reporting segments. We'll start with Kellanova North America and Slide number 23. North America's fourth quarter results continued to show the impact of rising elasticities across all of our categories. Recall that we entered 2023 with low service levels due to economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages, and therefore we elected to launch less innovation and to return to merchandising only after we were strongly confident that service levels had returned to normal levels. This, in conjunction with category elasticity, suddenly and rapidly rising, negatively impacted our volumes, particularly in the second half. Despite lapping an unusually strong year earlier period, North America's operating profit grew strongly year-on-year in the fourth quarter. Even accounting for the reimbursement of expenses related to transition services provided to WKKC in this year's quarter four, North America's operating profit grew in the mid-single digits year-on-year, continuing to restore underlying gross profit margin and operating profit margin by more than projected. So in spite of slowing categories and amidst the organization undergoing significant change related to the spin-off, North America again delivered financially. Within its key category groups, we can see the deceleration in top line growth caused by the rising elasticities. Slide number 24 shows our North America snacks business, which experienced slowing category growth rates during the year. Volume growth rates in our categories did not worsen in the fourth quarter, though elasticities continued to edge higher. We continued to feel the impact of less innovation year-on-year, particularly in crackers, and this will be addressed in 2024 when we return to a full innovation launch calendar. And we did see year-on-year increases in display activity and our return to merchandising and improving quality of displays will continue to gain traction as we head into the new year. It was a similar story in frozen foods shown on Slide number 25. Along with the frozen breakfast category, Eggo's consumption turned to a decline in the fourth quarter on rising elasticities. Morningstar Farms continued to gain share, but in a declining veg, vegan category. We believe these conditions are transitory for both categories and expect better performance in 2024. So let's talk about what to expect from North America in 2024, indicated on Slide number 26. First with supply impediments well behind us, we are returning to full commercial activity in 2024. This starts with a full slate of innovation launches and it includes a full year of robust merchandising and display activity. We will also continue to support our focus brands with increased brand building investment. The results should be improved in market performance and a gradual return to volume growth. And if you have been watching the Pop Tarts bowl and Cheez-It bowl, as well as the upcoming Pringles activation for Sunday's big game are good examples of how we plan to show up in 2024. Now let's turn to Kellanova Europe and Slide number 27. Here we finished the year with another strong quarter, yet again delivering organic net sales growth on top of prior year growth. In a market that is extremely price sensitive, we were again able to realize double-digit price mix growth through effective revenue growth management actions though elasticities did rise, impacting volume. Our organic net sales growth was 10% in the quarter and 9% for the full year. Europe delivered strong operating profit growth in the fourth quarter and full year. Granted, this was lapping a sharp year ago decline, but it did feature strong top line growth and better margin recovery than expected, getting its operating profit margin back to flat for the full year. On Slide number 28, you can see that snacks, which represent over half of our sales in Kellanova Europe, continued to lead our growth in this region. Our double-digit organic growth in net sales both in the quarter and for the full year was across all of our major sub regions. Revenue growth management actions drove the growth while volume declines remained relatively modest. The salty snacks category has slowed but remained in high-single digit growth across key markets and Pringles in the fourth quarter was tracking the gain share led by the UK and Spain. In portable wholesome snacks, we have managed to outpace the category in the UK and Italy. In cereals shown on Slide number 29, you can see that we grew net sales organically in the quarter. This too was led by revenue growth management actions, while elasticities have been running higher in this category than in our snacks categories. We finished 2023 with organic net sales growth of about 1%. Slide number 30 points to some elements to watch for in Europe in 2024. We expect to deliver a 7th consecutive year of organic growth. The growth will be led by snacks with Pringles continuing to be supported with innovation and brand building and portable wholesome snacks in key markets, notably Pop Tarts and Rice Krispies Squares. We're also excited about launching Cheez-It in key European markets in the second half. In cereal, our focus will be on optimizing our cereal portfolio in conjunction with the manufacturing network optimization that we're commencing this year. Now let's look at our emerging markets regions, starting with Latin America on Slide number 31. In the fourth quarter, Latin America's net sales grew 5% on an organic and recast basis, with volume declines moderating even in spite of sizable impact from our SKU rationalization and price pack architecture initiatives. The region finished the year with strong 8% organic net sales growth. Operating profit declined in the fourth quarter against a substantial year earlier gain, but despite some incremental investments and transitory cost pressures, it finished the full year with 8% growth on an adjusted and currency neutral basis. Slide number 32 shows that our snack sales were flat on an organic basis in the fourth quarter, comparing against a notably strong year earlier period. Pringles continued to perform well. End market data show sustained double-digit category growth for our major salty snacks markets, with Pringles gaining share in Brazil and holding share in Mexico. And we continue to outpace the portable wholesome snacks category in Mexico, though we did see rising elasticities in cookies in Brazil. Our Latin America snacks business finished the full year with 7% organic net sales growth. In Latin America cereals shown on Slide number 33, our organic net sales growth was strong in the quarter and for the full year. Specifically, sales grew 10% in the quarter and finished the full year with 9% growth. Cereal category consumption growth has held up in the mid to high-single digits across much of the region and we gained share in Mexico. As we look to 2024, a few things to watch for in Latin America are shown on Slide number 34. We expect a seven straight year of organic net sales growth. The growth should be led by snacks, particularly behind Pringles innovation and distribution expansion, and we also expect good growth in cereal. Margins should improve, reflecting price pack architecture and other RGM initiatives and operating efficiencies, as well as moderating input cost pressures. Slide number 35 shows the financial performance of our EMEA region. This region sustained its strong momentum in the fourth quarter when organic net sales growth reaccelerated to 22% on a combination of price mix growth and volume growth led by Africa. For the full year, our organic net sales growth was 17%. Now, obviously a large portion of this currency neutral growth came from Nigeria, where currency devaluation necessitated significant pricing actions. Nevertheless, the rest of EMEA posted solid growth in the quarter as well. Margins continued to recover year-on-year and operating profit grew 25% in the quarter on an adjusted and currency neutral basis in spite of substantially higher brand investment and despite lapping strong prior year growth, its operating profit increased by 20% for the full year. Within EMEA, we see on Slide number 36 that snacks grew organically at a double-digit pace in the fourth quarter and for the full year. This growth was led by Pringles in emerging markets across Asia, Africa and the Middle East, as well as in more developed markets like Australia, Korea and Japan. Pringles continued to gain share overall, principally due to outperformance in Thailand, Australia and Japan. In cereal shown on Slide number 37, we sustained organic growth, posting 4% growth in the fourth quarter and 6% growth for the full year. This was led by emerging markets in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. And we finish with noodles and other shown on Slide number 38. Revenue growth management actions continued to be taken in Nigeria as we try to keep up with weakened currencies, but volume also grew in the double digits in the fourth quarter, reflecting the strength of our brands and our execution as well as timing of shipments. Meanwhile, we also continued to expand our Kellogg's noodles business outside of Nigeria and this also contributed to our volume growth in the quarter. We expect EMEA to sustain momentum into 2024, as discussed on Slide number 39. To deliver the region's 17 straight year of organic net sales growth, we expect to see strong growth if moderating from 2023 rates in noodles and other. We expect to see sustained momentum in snacks led by Pringles, and we expect to sustain growth in cereal led by emerging markets. Margin expansion should continue led by our businesses outside of Nigeria. In those markets, input cost pressures are finally moderating and productivity and operating leverage continue to contribute positively. So let me summarize with Slide number 41. Simply put, the Kellanova era is off to a good start. We've executed well the spinoff and the post-spinoff operations, including transition services and we delivered our initial quarter ahead of our expectations. We're now shifting back to a focus on demand generation after a few years of supply focus. We're very excited about our 2024 commercial plans, which feature a return to a full complement of innovation, brand building, merchandising, as well as sustaining momentum and scale building in our emerging markets. We're also pleased with our progress and plans for restoring and expanding profit margins, which has proceeded faster than we had anticipated. Our outlook for 2024, first shared with you as far back as last August remains intact, calling for another year of on algorithm sales and profit growth. And we're not sitting still. We're already creating the future. For instance, we are adding much needed capacity for Pringles in emerging markets. The international expansion of Cheez-It continues with launches coming in Europe, and we are commencing network optimization initiatives that will both expand margins and fuel growth investments. In sum, we are on track and ready to deliver as Kellanova and the future certainly is bright. Of course, none of this would be possible without the grit and skill of our supremely talented Kellanova employees, all of whom are as determined as ever to differentiate, drive and deliver. And now, we'd be happy to take your questions. Peter, he didn't survive the bowl game, in case you weren't watching. Yes. It's going to \u2013 Rob, thanks for the question. It's going to be throughout the year. Really, we started with displays coming back to prior years, better than prior year in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, we're going to see the quality of those displays improving. That will continue into the second quarter as well. And just to remind you, 2023 was a year of pullback on innovation, culling of SKUs, clearly focused on supply and making sure that we could have that supply in the market. In the U.S., though, for example, we've got Pringles Harvest Blends, which we brought in the second half of 2023. We've got Cheez-It innovations, Cheez-It Crunchy, which is hitting now. We've got Pop-Tarts crunchy poppers. We've got innovations around Nutri-Grain. We've got a Rice Krispies Treats with peanut butter. We've just got many more innovations than we've had in prior years, and that will roll throughout the year. We've also got distribution growing where it had been declining. So you should see momentum growing really starting now and picking up all through the year. And that gives us really good confidence in the top-line guide that we gave. The other thing I'd add, Rob, is a higher brand building investment as well, which we phased into the first half of this year as well to really drive that quality to display and that quality merchandising. There's not really an inflection point per se. I think you're going to see a cumulative improvement with probably the third quarter being the one where it be most notable and then we'll exit the year with lots of momentum. So it will be cumulative throughout the year and growing from the second into the third quarter. Yes. Thanks, Chris. So it really \u2013 it's not \u2013 it's much less the core than it is some of the innovations that we really didn't support with quality display merchandising. And so if you look at Cheez-It, the Snap'd and Puff'd, and if you were to look at the cases on display for those dramatically down as we focused on the core supply. And we have owned it. We returned to merchandising later than our competitors. We were more conservative when it came to that merchandising overly focused on making sure that we had high 90s fill rates before we return to merchandising. So that's what you see in the share. We don't see any deterioration in our brand health. In fact, we see our brand health really at very high watermarks across Cheez-It, Pringles, Pop-Tarts, Rice Krispies Treats. And so that gives us the confidence to talk about the quality of merchandising returning and our share performance improving as we go throughout 2024, again, coupled with more brand investments in the first half of the year. When you look at our brand investment, we never \u2013 we didn't pull back in 2023. We publish advertising only on a full year basis. You'll see advertising up in 2023, that's going to continue into 2024. Yes, that's right, because I mean, the comparisons are going to be against the year where we really didn't innovate and now we're getting back to kind of pre-COVID levels of innovation. Yes. So you're probably asking about the U.S., the frequency of promotions continues to return to pre-pandemic levels, so 2019 levels. The depth of those promotions is really kind of back to approaching those levels off a higher base. And so I'd say the whole market is pretty benign and stable. You don't see \u2013 I've heard some of the noise around because volumes are down, is there going to be high levels of discounting and increased frequency of promotion. We're not really seeing that. For us, we're getting \u2013 we're trying to get back to the pre-2019 levels, as I've mentioned a couple of times now in terms of frequency to drive quality promotional displays. But not seeing anything other than that really. There's a little bit of that, but really it's more. If you think about what we've been through as an industry focused on supply, focused on getting through the pandemic, focused on bottlenecks and shortages, the ability to really dedicate resources towards effectiveness programs and efficiency programs like this was challenging. And so we're through that right now, and we see good opportunities in the frozen business. So we'll be closing a plant and moving production to our more efficient plants in the UK, subject to consultation. We've got our Manchester plant, which is a very large plant, which is underutilized. We can move that production into two facilities. So straightforward programs in terms of the type of efficiencies they'll drive. We're confident that they're terrific programs. But it's really a matter of having the bandwidth pre or post pandemic, post bottlenecks and shortages that will allow us to ongoing look for programs like this to continue to drive effectiveness and efficiency. Yes, Rob. We get asked a lot, why is Cheez-It primarily a U.S. brand? Why not expand it 10 years ago? And I think that's a fair question. The company was very busy expanding Pringles around the world. And you see, obviously now it's a global brand growing all around the world, recognized everywhere. And that's the long-term ambition for something like Cheez-It, which is the next out of the gate. But you start with Cheese [ph]. And we launched in Canada, we launched in Brazil and Mexico, and this year, the back half of the year, we'll be launching in major markets in Europe. And so it's a long-term play. It's in our guidance, it's not really \u2013 it's not going to be a material driver of top line. But five years from now, it's going to be a much bigger brand internationally than it is today. And that's really the plan. We learned from the Canada launch. We applied those learnings to Brazil, then to Mexico, and we've got a terrific plan for the back half of the year in Europe. And so it's a long-term play. Then you look at the rest of our portfolio. Rice Krispies Treats is already a multi-country brand, growing nicely in Europe, growing nicely in Australia and New Zealand. You look at Pop-Tarts, there's potentially room for that to be an international brand down the road. So we look at our portfolio, we like what we see in terms of international expansion, but we're going to do it in a very prudent and pragmatic and practical way to drive long-term growth."

            "name": "Amit Banati",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Slide Number 12 summarizes our results for the fourth quarter and full year for Kellanova. As John indicated, the year-on-year growth rates are based on recast results for the four quarters of 2022 and the first three quarters of 2023. As you can see, our results for the quarter came in above the guidance we had provided, and they complete a full year in which we maintained our focus on delivering consistent, on algorithm results even amidst the incremental work of executing the spinoff. Net sales increased by about 7% on an organic and recast basis in quarter four, featuring decelerating volume declines and price mix growth that is moderating as we lap significant revenue growth management actions in the prior year. For the full year, Kellanova's organic net sales growth was about 8%, well above our long-term growth target. Operating profit in quarter four increased by 30% on an adjusted and currency-neutral basis and comparing against a recast 2022. This was driven by the solid top line growth as well as by a restoration of our underlying gross profit margin and reimbursement for expenses related to transition services we are providing to W.K. Kellogg Company. For the full year, Kellanova's operating profit increased by 18% on the same recast basis. Even taking into account the year-over-year impact of expense reimbursement for transition services, provided to WKKC in quarter four, 2023, which did not exist in the year earlier quarter, our year-on-year growth in operating profit was still in double digits for the quarter and the year, well ahead of our long-term target. Earnings per share on an adjusted and currency-neutral basis increased by about 19% year-on-year in quarter four and by 7% year-to-date as strong operating profit performance more than covered significant headwinds from macroeconomic factors that drove up interest expense and pull down pension income. Finally, free cash flow came in higher than we had expected in quarter four, finishing the year at $968 million. Free cash flow is not recast for discontinued operations. So the decrease from last year's solely related to onetime outlays related to the spin-off and the absence of North America cereals cash flow in the fourth quarter. Now let's take a look at each metric in closer detail starting with our net sales growth on Slide Number 13. As expected, price elasticities continue to rise around the world in quarter four, putting pressure on volume though this volume, again, came in better than projected due to better performance in our emerging markets. Price/mix continued to moderate sequentially from recent quarters as expected as we lap some of our largest revenue growth management actions last year. The result was another quarter of elevated organic net sales growth, though, to be clear, about half of that came from our Africa joint ventures where substantial pricing is needed to cover devaluing currency and shipments were unusually strong. That said, even excluding that business, we sustained organic growth that was in line with our long-term target. Moving across to the nonorganic drivers of net sales, the divestiture of our Russia business, which occurred in July, clipped about a percentage point from our overall net sales growth in quarter four, just as it did in quarter three. Foreign currency translation was a headwind of about negative six percentage points in quarter four and about negative four percentage points for the full year. This reflected primarily the Nigerian Naira, which continued to devalue during the fourth quarter and was only partially offset by strength in the euro, pound sterling and Mexican peso. While we don't provide guidance on foreign exchange rates, if today's rates held for the year, we would likely experience an impact on net sales that is similar to the impact that we saw in quarter four. Now let's discuss our profit margin recovery, starting with gross profit on Slide Number 14. In quarter four, we continue to grow gross profit and restore gross profit margins. As in the previous quarters, this restoration of margins was aided by revenue growth management, productivity and improved supply and service levels. In addition, the other half of the quarter's margin expansion was driven by reimbursement of expenses related to transition services provided to WKKC, which did not exist in the year ago quarter. You'll notice that at 34% in quarter four, Kellanova's gross margin is structurally higher than Kellogg Company's margin, and it continued to come in higher than we had anticipated. We expect to continue to improve gross margin in 2024. Turning to Slide Number 15, we see that in quarter four and the full year, we also grew operating profit, driven by growth in net sales and the higher gross profit margin. Meantime, operating profit margin improved year-on-year in quarter four and the full year. Remember, the 12.3% margin you see for 2023 is recast for discontinued operations so it does not include reimbursement for transition service expenses during the first three quarters. We expect our operating profit margin to reach 14% in 2024. Moving down the income statement, Slide Number 16 shows how our adjusted basis earnings per share growth in 2023, even on a recast basis fell the year-on-year effects of macro-related headwinds within our non-operating, below-the-line items. These below-the-line pressures were expected and were experienced year-on-year in quarter four and the full year, even comparing to a recast 2022, and for all the reasons we have discussed previously. Foreign currency translation was modestly positive to earnings per share in 2023, including quarter four as strength in European and Mexican currencies more than offset what is a relatively small impact from Nigeria naira at the EPS level. Recall that due to our ownership structure, while the naira had a large impact on net sales its impact on operating profit and EPS is much smaller. Turning to Slide number 17. We are pleased with our cash flow generation and balance sheet. Noting that we have not recast free cash flow for discontinued items, we finished 2023 only modestly below 2022. Despite the absence of the spun-off North America cereal cash flows for a quarter, and despite one-time cash outlays related to the spin-off. In fact, the combination of these spin-off factors amounted to about $300 million of negative impact. If you added that back, you can see that our free cash flow would have come in above 2022 levels. Our balance sheet after the transfer of net debt to WKKC remains solid with debt leverage remaining well below our targeted ratio of net debt to trailing EBITDA of 3x. Now let's discuss our 2024 guidance shown on Slide number 18. The 2023 base is recast for discontinued operations. And because these figures may differ from WKKC carve-out figures and our internal management figures, we've chosen to continue to provide you with absolute dollar guidance for operating profit and earnings per share in 2024. After all, 2024 is what is really important as it is the first full year in our current P&L structure. Let's go through each metric. For net sales, we affirm our guidance for growth within our long-term targeted range, specifically calling for a 3% growth or better in 2024. Across most of our businesses, price mix growth will moderate as we continue to lap prior actions and industry-wide elasticities will fade gradually during the year. The exception is Nigeria where currency influence pricing actions will likely continue, which we assume produce meaningful elasticity impact on volume. Organic growth, of course, excludes currency translation, which based on today's exchange rates, would be a headwind of 5% to 6%. For adjusted basis operating profit, we continue to provide absolute dollar guidance because year-on-year growth rate can be impacted by discontinued operations accounting. We are affirming the range of $1.85 billion to $1.9 billion. This incorporates a negative impact from currency translation, which based on today's exchange rates, would be approximately 2%, versus recast 2023 figures, this implies growth in operating profit in the mid-teens. After taking into account the year-over-year impact of expense reimbursement for transition services provided to WKKC for four quarters in 2024 versus only in the fourth quarter in 2023, this year-on-year growth is still in the mid single-digits, solidly on our long-term target. Our guidance implies continued margin expansion as an improving gross profit margin more than offsets a strong increase in brand investment. We expect to reach a 14% operating margin in 2024. Adjusted basis, earnings per share is still expected to be in the range of $3.55 to $3.65. We make no change to our previously communicated expectation for an increase in our effective tax rate to 23%. Our outlook for interest expense is about $310 million and we expect other income to be around $50 million. And we are affirming our outlook for free cash flow of approximately $1 billion with year-on-year growth driven by operating profit partially offset by capital expenditure temporarily elevated for expanded Pringles capacity in emerging markets and modest cash outlays related to our two network optimization projects. These network optimization projects are addressed on Slide number 19. At our Day@K Investor event in August, we cited network optimization as one of the drivers of our margin expansion, and we are now ready to discuss specific initiatives. The two projects we are announcing today are both high return projects. Only about half of the project's upfront costs are cash even before asset sales and the projects collectively become cash neutral by 2025. In 2024, specifically, upfront costs will amount to about $160 million with less than $40 million of that in cash, and this has been incorporated into our cash flow guidance. Savings for the project start very quickly with a small portion of the overall $75 million coming as soon as the second half of 2024. And this too is incorporated into our guidance. In fact, this is a contributor to our operating profit margin expanding to 14% this year, as implied by our operating profit guidance. Importantly, with this announcement, we can also now be more specific about the timing of our medium-term goal of a 15% operating margin. We expect to reach that margin in 2026. So let's summarize our financial condition on Slide number 20. In what was our debut quarter as Kellanova, our fourth quarter results came in as guided from net sales to earnings per share. The business remains in good shape with margin restoration proceeding ahead of pace and volume performance on a path of gradual improvement. Consequently, we have affirmed our guidance for 2024, even amidst challenging industry and macroeconomic conditions. Our medium-term goal of attaining a 15% operating profit margin has been accelerated to 2026 as ongoing margin expansion drivers are now augmented by network optimization initiatives, which get started this year subject to consultation. And we continue to generate strong free cash flow that, along with our deleveraged balance sheet gives us financial flexibility. This flexibility has been on display in the form of opportunistic share buybacks during quarter four and in our decision to elevate capital investment to expand capacity for our rapidly growing Pringles business. So we enter 2024 in a strong financial condition. Let me now turn it back to Steve for a run-through of our businesses around the world. Yes. Peter, that does include the \u2013 operating profit does include the currency headwind, so just confirming that. Like I mentioned, it's approximately around 2% at today's rates. So that 2% is built into the dollar numbers that we've given. Yes. EPS is probably slightly lesser. Yes. At the Day at K, we had kind of given you the absolute dollar guidance just to kind of help set up your models. I think we don't intend to provide regional guidance going forward on an ongoing basis. But that said, I would say that all the regions for 2024, we'd expect them to be within their long-term algorithms growth rates that we had shared at Day at K. Gross margins have come in better than expected, and so I think the supply chain is performing well. We're seeing costs come out of the supply chain that had gone in the last couple of years. In quarter four, first quarter of Kellanova, our gross margin came in at 34%, and we'd expect that in 2024, we'd be approaching 35%. So that's kind of the outlook for the year. So pleased with the progress that we are making, and certainly the progress that we're making the gross margins is ahead of what we had shared at Day at K. That's allowed us to continue to be on our guidance on an operating profit basis. I think in terms of the drivers, you'll obviously have the benefit of wraparound pricing and some continued revenue growth management into this year. The input costs, I would say deflationary on commodities, a couple of commodities continue to be inflationary, net-net slightly deflationary. You look at labor and other parts of our supply chain where there is inflation overall, I'd say costs are broadly neutral. So that combination should drive continued progress on gross margin. And I think it'll be fairly balanced across the quarters. We'd expect our A&P to be more front loaded as we get back to full innovation. But the gross margin progress should be fairly balanced across the quarters. I think to organic net sales as well. Yes. North America. I'll just start. North America will probably be towards the low end of that range, so probably more low-single digit. But as Steve elaborated, its return to merchandising, innovation, all of that should result in low-single digit growth in North America. Yes. So a couple of things driving the strong volume growth in EMEA, and it was all in Africa JVs. One is we are expanding our noodles business across the continent in South Africa as well as in Egypt. So we're seeing strong volume growth. And that expansion is seeing good traction in terms of share and leading share positions in South Africa as well as in Egypt. So that's a source of volume growth, and that will continue in 2024. I think in Nigeria specifically, we've had to take a lot of pricing given what's happened with the currency and the elasticities have been pretty good and better than expected. There has been some ordering by our customers at older prices. So you're seeing acceleration of the orders to take benefit of the oil pricing. And in an environment where you're taking successive price increases, you kind of see that timing of shipments play through. Hard to kind of predict when that would unwind because as you know, the currency is devalued further in January, and we'd be taking further pricing. But we'd expect that to adjust during the course of 2024. Good morning, Michael. Yes. So just on the 12% versus the 13% at Day@K, they are on a different basis. So the 12% that you see right now is on the discontinued operations basis, which is \u2013 we've now done that work, and that's what we'll be reporting against. The 13%, which we had given at Day@K was an internal management estimate, and really the difference is the 12% does not include reimbursement for the first nine months, the TSA reimbursements for services that we're providing to WKKC, that's the way the discontinued operations accounting works. So that's really the difference between the 12% and the 13%. And I think, like I said, we expect in 2024 to be at 14% margin, so very pleased with that, obviously. And I think that's structurally higher than where we were as Kellogg's. And I think it's just a proof point of higher growth and higher profit portfolio that we have in Kellanova. And then I think to our confidence in getting to the 15% margin by 2026, yes, the network optimization projects are a contributing factor. And we'll continue to look at further opportunities but all the other drivers, advantage brands, our Top 5 brands have higher margins. They are 50% of our sales. We'd expect them to grow faster, scale in emerging markets, getting back to a full productivity program in our supply chain, some continued revenue growth management. All of those would also be contributing factors to get to that 15%. Yes. So it's about $40 million to $50 million a quarter, right? So it will flow through all of 2024. I think as we stop providing those services to WKKC and as WKKC contracts for those services directly, those costs will drop off from Kellanova and the reimbursement will drop off as well. So the vast majority, as this thing kind of concludes, right, as we step down from the TSAs, we'd expect the cost to stop and the reimbursement to stop. I mean, I think a good example of that is warehousing. Right now, the warehousing, we are providing the warehousing. So we are incurring the costs and then WKKC is reimbursing that to us. Once the TSA is done, they'll have their own warehousing and they'll pay for the warehousing cost directly. So the cost will stop, the reimbursement will stop. Is it a 100% 1:1? No. But I think the vast majority of that is variable. There is a small fixed element. And I think we've got plans to address that, and that's included in the 15% by size target? No, I think it's just timing because the growth rate \u2013 so when you look at 2024, right, we are getting reimbursement for all four quarters. In 2023, we got reimbursement only in quarter four because that was when the spin happened. So the reason why it's in the teens growth rate is in 2024, you've got four quarters in 2023, you've got one quarter. So it's purely because of the way the timing of the spin and the difference coming from there. Yes. Yes. I think there are costs which we are getting reimbursed. So I wouldn't characterize it as a benefit. We're incurring the cost on behalf of WKKC as part of the services we are providing them, and they are reimbursing us for those expenses that we are incurring. We would expect those expenses to drop off. And there's no markup on the service \u2013 so we would expect those expenses to drop off and then the reimbursement to drop off now is it a one-to-one? Not completely, but I'd say the vast majority of those \u2013 and I think like I mentioned in the warehouse example, that warehouse right now, we are paying for it, and we get reimbursement. Once they drop off, they'll pay for it directly. The growth percentage is related to the timing."

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session with publishing analysts. At this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for Kellanova Company. Please go ahead.\nJohn Renwick : Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for a review of our third quarter results when we were Kellogg Company and a discussion of our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2023, during which we will be post spin-off Kellanova. I'm joined this morning by Steve Cahillane, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Amit Banati, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. Slide number 3 shows our forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware, certain statements made today, such as projections for Kellanova's future performance, are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the third slide of this presentation as well as to our public SEC filings. A recording of today's webcast and supporting documents will be archived for at least 90 days on the Investor page of www.kellanova.com. As always, when referring to our results and outlook, unless otherwise noted, we will be referring to them on an organic basis for net sales and on a currency-neutral adjusted basis for operating profit and earnings per share. Please note that we will have discontinued operations impacts to Kellanova's historical financial statements available during our fourth quarter earnings release in February 2024. Until then, any commentary about Kellanova performance is based on estimates and should therefore be viewed as directional. And now I'll turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Cahillane : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. While our quarter three results predated the spin-off, it is exciting to be talking to you as Kellanova for the first time. It bears reminding that Kellanova is a strengthened portfolio with the business, brands and geographies that make Kellanova a global snacks-led powerhouse. As shown on Slide number 5, over 80% of our annual net sales comes from snacks and emerging markets, both of which have been and will continue to be above-average growth categories and markets. Half of our net sales come from five highly differentiated brands, Pringles, Cheez-It, Pop-Tarts, Rice Krispie Treats and Eggo, that offer above-average growth and accretive economics. And we generate half of our revenue from outside of the United States and Canada, giving us geographic diversification, global reach, access to fast-growing emerging markets and the opportunity to expand big United States brands into international markets. And when you see temporary softness in one market, it can be offset elsewhere, which is precisely what we saw in the third quarter. Kellanova is also a company with a sharpened strategy, one that better suits a global snacking powerhouse, while still emphasizing the capabilities that enable us to win in the marketplace, protect our planet and serve our communities, and deliver attractive and dependable financial returns. This strategy appropriately called differentiate, drive and deliver is shown on Slide number 6. But before we enter the Kellanova era, let's talk about our final quarter as Kellogg Company on Slide number 7. We turned in another good performance in the third quarter. Organic net sales growth was sustained at an on-algorithm pace despite a challenging environment marked by a financially strained consumer and the long-awaited return toward normal levels of elasticities. We're pleased with our continued restoration of gross profit margins. As service levels have returned to normal levels, productivity initiatives are delivering savings and pricing has caught up with input cost inflation. And this enabled us to deliver above-algorithm growth in operating profit even as we increased our brand building at a double-digit rate. Our free cash flow was strong, ahead of last year, even with upfront outlays related to the spin-off. And speaking of the spin-off, we executed it with excellence. So it was another busy and successful quarter, and we are heading into the Kellanova era from a position of strength. Externally, the focus lately has been less about our improved portfolio strategy and long-term growth prospects and much more about current industry dynamics. Fair enough, but I would remind everyone that most of what we are seeing today from decelerating cost inflation to restoration of service levels and margins, to a return to normal levels of elasticities have been in our budget, our guidance and our commentary for quite some time. This is illustrated on slide number 8. The decelerated net sales growth was inevitable because after significant cumulative price increases, including right through the second quarter of 2023, there was going to be a return to typical levels of elasticities in our industry. And across our categories and across our regions, we have seen this rise in elasticities every quarter this year. We don't think this is about price gaps over private label, which largely remain below 2019 levels. And the relatively small shares of private label in our categories remain around their 2019 levels. We did have a couple of additional factors that impacted our volumes in the quarter, but again, these were anticipated. One was lapping trade inventory replenishment from last year, notably in North America cereal and snacks and the other, also in North America, was our decision to delay merchandising activity earlier this year in order to gain full confidence in our return to high service levels, particularly given the lead time required for quality display activity. This caused us some volume in the second and third quarter. But by the latter part of quarter three, we had returned in merchandising, and we expect quality display activity to follow. In short, these conditions and timing differences will pass. Our brand-building investment is increasing. We are returning to merchandising, and we are ramping back up our innovation. We will return to more balanced volume and price/mix within our net sales growth over time, accompanied by sustained improvement in profit margins. Meantime, our brands remain in great shape. And our focus remains on growing our biggest, most differentiated brands around the world. Shown on slide number 9, these brands accounted for half of Kellanova's net sales in 2022 and a little more than that so far in 2023 as their growth continues to outpace the rest of the portfolio. In the quarter and year-to-date periods, we increased brand-building investment behind these advantaged brands at strong double-digit rates year-on-year, faster than the rest of the portfolio. As we prioritize investment behind these brands, we expect them to continue to lead our growth and contribute positively to margin mix. Our focus is also on growing the right way, and slide number 10 shows some of the ways our Better Days Promise program manifested itself during the third quarter. We unveiled new, more ambitious targets for Kellanova, sustained our legacy of helping our communities and found ways to link these activities to our commercial endeavors, and we continue to be recognized for our efforts. So let me now turn it over to Amit, who will walk you through our financials, before I come back and discuss each of our businesses in more detail.\nAmit Banati: Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Slide number 12 summarizes the results of Kellogg Company because the spin-off occurred after the quarter ended. Net sales increased by about 4% on an organic basis in quarter three, which is right on the second half pace implied by our full year guidance. Year-to-date, this translates into 8% organic growth. Operating profit increased by 10% on an adjusted and currency-neutral basis, sustaining double-digit growth in spite of higher A&P investment and the divestiture of our Russia business. Year-to-date, this translates to 14% growth, which is ahead of the pace implied by our full year guidance. Earnings per share on an adjusted and currency-neutral basis decreased by about 2% year-on-year in quarter three and increased by 2% year-to-date. This is ahead of the pace implied by our full year guidance, delivering year-on-year growth in spite of some 11 to 12 percentage points of headwind from macroeconomic factors driving higher interest expense and lower pension income. And free cash flow came in at $894 million, which is higher than last year, even in spite of onetime outlays related to the spin-off. This put cash flow well on pace towards our full year guidance for Kellogg Company. So as you step back, you see that our growth in net sales and operating profit were on algorithm or better in the quarter and year-to-date period, and EPS would have been as well were it not for the macro-related pressures on our non-operating items. And we were well on pace to achieve the full year guidance we had given for the Kellogg Company. Now, let's take a look at each metric in closer detail, starting with our net sales growth on slide number 13. As expected, price elasticities rose around the world, putting pressure on volume, though this volume did come in modestly better than projected. Price/mix moderated sequentially from recent quarters as we began to lap some of our largest revenue growth management actions last year. The divestiture of our Russia business, which occurred in July, clipped about 1 percentage point from our overall net sales growth in quarter three and will do so again in quarter four. Foreign currency translation once again was a headwind of about negative 3 percentage points. And based on where rates are today, we are probably facing a similar headwind in quarter four. Most of this is related to the devaluation of the Nigerian naira, partially offset by strength in the euro, pound sterling and Mexican peso. We estimate that portions of the business that represent Kellanova generated better organic growth than total Kellogg Company in the third quarter. So even with the long anticipated rise in elasticities and the lapping of last year's pricing actions, our organic net sales growth remains within our long-term target range. Now, let's discuss gross profit, starting with slide number 14. As we've stated many times, our focus during the period of heightened input cost inflation and supply bottlenecks and shortages was on growing gross profit dollars. And as you can see, we have done just that every quarter this year. And as you can see on slide number 15, we have also made good progress in restoring our gross profit margin as well. We're still not back to our 2019 pre-pandemic levels, but this restoration of margins is proceeding faster than expected with year-on-year expansion in each quarter so far this year. This progress also applies to the Kellanova business, which gets an immediate lift from the absence of North America cereal, and should continue to benefit from the same drivers going forward price realization catching up to input cost inflation, improving supply chain conditions, and the ongoing combination of productivity, revenue growth management and mix shift towards our most differentiated brands. Slide number 16 shows how our sustained top line growth and margin expansion resulted in another quarter of double-digit growth in operating profit. Keep in mind that, this growth includes the divestiture of Russia, and it also includes a double-digit increase in brand building on a currency-neutral basis. Slide number 17 indicates that we are not only restoring our margins at the gross profit level, but at the operating profit level as well. We have delivered year-on-year expansion in operating margin in each quarter of this year, putting our year-to-date margin a full 100 basis points ahead of last year and ahead of our own projections as Kellanova will start immediately with a modestly higher operating margin just from the absence of North America cereal. And we expect to continue to improve our margin going forward as we discussed at our Day@K Investor event. This, along with top line growth propelled by our strong brands and growth-oriented categories and markets, give us confidence in sustaining profit growth. Moving down the income statement. Slide number 18 shows that our adjusted basis earnings per share growth in quarter three was once again mostly attributable to operating profit, which has grown enough to more than offset what are severe macro-related headwinds within our below-the-line items. Those below-the-line pressures were expected and will continue through the year. Interest expense increased significantly year-on-year in the quarter and the year-to-date period due to higher interest rates. Other income decreased sharply year-on-year in each of the first three quarters this year, reflecting the accounting of pension and post-retirement plan asset values stemming from last year's decline in the financial markets and the rising interest rates. Our effective tax rate in quarter three was up year-on-year, keeping our year-to-date rate at the 22% we've been expecting for the full year. Average shares outstanding were again up slightly year-on-year in quarter three, and we would expect that to be the case for the full year as well. Foreign currency translation was positive to earnings per share in quarter three as strength in European and Mexican currencies more than offset what is a relatively small impact from Nigerian Naira at the EPS level. Turning to slide number 19. We see that our free cash flow year-to-date is ahead of the prior year, even in spite of one-time cash outlays related to the spin-off and despite lapping a year ago period in which our capital expenditure was delayed because of supply disruptions. We are pleased with our cash flow conversion, which is higher than last year despite deal factors. This year-to-date free cash flow performance put us well on our way to achieving the full year guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion that we had communicated for the Kellogg Company. Meanwhile, we continue to reduce our debt leverage year-on-year, further enhancing our financial flexibility. The slide shows how our net debt continued to decrease even as we continue to deliver higher operating profit and therefore EBITDA. This was our net debt at the end of quarter prior to the spin-off. Upon the spin-off, the transfer of net debt to W.K. Kellogg Company was executed and is estimated to be approximately $600 million. Now, let's discuss our outlook at Kellanova now that W.K. Kellogg Company, our North America cereal business, is no longer in our portfolio. Work is underway to prepare Kellanova financials for all four quarters of 2022 and the first three quarters of 2023, treating W.K. KC as a discontinued operation. We will have those completed a few months from now, and we plan to share them with you at our next quarterly earnings release in early February. In the meantime, slide number 20 offers estimates in absolute dollars for the fourth quarter, our initial quarter at Kellanova. Kellanova was projected to deliver net sales of approximately $3.1 billion in the quarter. Excluding W.K. KC from the base and excluding about 1% negative impact of the Russia divestiture and foreign currency translation that at current rates would be similar to the negative impact we saw on net sales in quarter three, we believe organic net sales growth will be within our long-term growth target even as we assume continued elasticity impact and the lapping of the year-on-year price increases. We expect the restoration of gross profit margin to continue, increasing year-on-year and reaching a level in quarter four of just over 33%. We project adjusted basis operating profit of approximately $380 million to $390 million, which we estimate will translate into year-on-year growth that is within our long-term growth target. Excluding W.K. KC from the base and excluding the small impacts of this year's Russia divestiture and currency translation. We project adjusted basis earnings per share of approximately $0.73 to $0.76 after accounting for interest expense of around $85 million and other income of around $25 million, both of which will continue to reflect the year-on-year headwinds we've experienced all year. In short, we expect Kellanova's quarter four 2023 to remain within our long-term algorithm for net sales and operating profit growth. Looking to 2024. As indicated at our Day at K investor event a few months ago, we expect to sustain on-algorithm growth on sales and profit. We are still in our budgeting process, and we will provide those details at our normal time in February. Allow me to summarize on slide number 21. We feel very good about our financial performance and conditions heading into quarter four as the new Kellanova. Our top line growth remains ahead of our long-term target. Our profit margins continue to recover more quickly than we had anticipated. Our balance sheet is solid as is our free cash flow even as we executed a transformational spin-off. Let me now turn it back to Steve for a run-through of our businesses around the world.\nSteve Cahillane: Thanks, Amit. Slide number 23 splits our portfolio into category groups to help remind you of their relative sizes and how Kellanova\u2019s portfolio is clearly oriented toward growth. Beginning in the fourth quarter, Kellanova will no longer have the North America cereal portion nor the very small Caribbean cereal portion of international cereal. As you can see on the slide, the businesses that will remain with Kellanova continue to drive most of our growth in quarter three. As we walk through our regions, which is how we are structured, we will once again organize our discussion around the businesses that comprise Kellanova first, followed by the North America cereal business that is now part of W.K. Kellogg Co. We'll start with the region's most exposed to emerging markets. Slide number 24 shows the financial performance of our AMEA region. Once again, this region generated double-digit organic net sales growth on top of extremely strong comparisons. It again expanded its operating profit margin year-on-year in the third quarter and it again posted exceptional profit growth, up 14% on an adjusted and currency-neutral basis. And this profit was delivered in spite of high cost inflation and substantial reinvestment into the business. Within AMEA, we see on slide number 25 that snacks turned in another quarter of double-digit organic growth in net sales. This organic growth was again broad-based across Australia, Asia and Africa and the Middle East. In market, Pringles continues to gain share in the region with notably strong outperformance relative to the category this quarter in Australia and Japan. As shown on Slide 26, AMEA cereal also sustained growth in the third quarter in spite of lapping elevated year ago growth. Growth was broad-based with notable growth in Australia, Africa and Southeast Asia. And in market, our overall share gain in the region was led by notably strong performance in Korea and New Zealand. And then we come to noodles and others shown on Slide number 27. This business continues to post exceptional growth even as it begins to lap substantial price increases taken last year to offset cost inflation and weakened currencies. Our business in Nigeria continues to grow strongly, owing to the strength of Dufil's brands and the huge competitive advantage of our distributor arm Multipro. We also continue to expand our Kellogg's noodle business outside of Nigeria. AMEA enters the Kellanova era with solid momentum. For the full year, we continue to expect to sustain strong growth across all three category groups, delivering yet another year of organic net sales growth. And we plan to do that while restoring our profit margins and investing for the future. Now let's look at our other emerging markets region, Latin America, starting on Slide number 29. Kellogg Latin America in quarter three delivered another quarter of strong organic net sales growth on top of exceptionally strong growth last year. This organic growth was once again led by our two largest markets, Mexico and Brazil, though our Pacific subregion also putted strong growth. It's important to note that roughly half of our volume decline, both in the third quarter and year-to-date, was attributable to price pack architecture changes and SKU rationalization that we have undertaken to improve profitability. We again expanded our operating margin in quarter three, leading to a fourth straight quarter of operating profit growth of 20% or better. On Slide number 30, we see that our snacks business in Latin America generated strong organic net sales growth in the third quarter, led by sustained momentum in Mexico and Brazil. Both of those markets saw double-digit category growth in salty snacks, and Pringles gained share in both of these key markets. And in portable wholesome snacks, we continue to outpace the category in Mexico. On Slide number 31, you can see that Kellogg Latin America grew net sales organically again in cereal in spite of lapping exceptional growth in the year ago quarter. This growth was led by Mexico and our Pacific subregion. Keep in mind that a sliver of this business, our Caribbean cereal business, has since been spun off with W.K. Kellogg Co., but this business represented only about 5% of our Latin America cereal business last year, so it is quite small. So Latin America is performing well as it heads into the Kellanova era. For the full year, we continue to expect this region to sustain strong top line momentum with growth in both snacks and cereal and continued recovery in its profit margins. Once again, we can see that both of our emerging markets regions are showing current momentum to go with their outstanding long-term prospects. Now let's turn to our developed markets regions, starting with Kellogg Europe and Slide number 33. This region sustained yet another quarter of strong organic net sales growth on top of strong year-earlier growth. Operating profit increased sharply year-on-year, owing to good top line growth, moderating cost pressures and solid margin expansion, all of which more than offset the impact of divesting Russia earlier in the quarter. If we look deeper into the business, on Slide number 34, you can see that snacks, which represents over half of our sales in Kellogg Europe, continue to lead our growth in this region. In fact, quarter three marked the quarter in the last 11 in which we have posted double-digit organic net sales growth in our European snacks business. The growth in quarter three also continued to be broad based with double-digit gains in all three of our sub-regions. In markets, salty snacks category remains in double-digit growth overall with Pringles outpacing the category in markets like the UK, France, Spain, Italy and Poland. And in portable wholesome snacks, category growth rates have accelerated into the double-digits. And we continued to gain substantial share in the UK, led by double-digit growth in Rice Krispies Squares. Our cereal business in Europe, shown on Slide number 35, posted a small organic decline in net sales in the third quarter. As we've discussed previously, this business has slowed owing to the rising category elasticities. But we are confident in our quarter four plans, which includes incremental brand building shifted from previous quarters. So it was another strong quarter for Kellogg Europe. For the full year, we continue to expect the region to post yet another year of solid top line growth led by snacks. We also remain on track to deliver improved margins during the second half in spite of sustained cost pressures. Our divestiture of our business in Russia was a necessary move in an unfortunate situation. But overall, this region is showing good momentum as it heads into the Kellanova era. We'll now turn to Kellogg North America in Slide number 37. As anticipated, net sales growth has decelerated in recent quarters as elasticity continued to move higher and as we begin to lap last year's sizable replenishment of trade inventories. However, we continue to recover gross profit margin, reflecting productivity, revenue growth management and diminishing bottlenecks and shortages. This enabled us to substantially increase investment in our brands and still deliver high single-digit operating profit growth year-on-year in the third quarter. The rise in elasticities, as well as the lapping of last year's strong growth in inventory replenishment can be seen in all three category groups in the third quarter. Slide number 38 shows snacks, which represents over half of our North America net sales. In the third quarter, its net sales were up very slightly against a very big quarter last year. In market, all three of our snacks categories experienced rising elasticities, particularly in higher cash outlay items like multipacks. In addition, we took a more measured approach than many in restoring merchandising activity. It was a similar story in frozen foods, shown on Slide number 39. Our frozen foods net sales were flat in the third quarter. Like snacks, our Eggo business faced a rise in category elasticities. In addition, our Morningstar Farms brand continued to feel the impact of a shakeout in the plant-based category even as it continued to gain share. Now let's turn to our North America cereal business, which forms most of what is now W.K. Kellogg Co. You will get more detail from W.K. Kellogg Co. in its own earnings release. But as shown on Slide number 40, this business faced the same dynamics as the Kellanova businesses in the third quarter: flattish sales, reflecting a continued rise in category elasticities and the lapping of strong year-ago growth. Turning to Slide number 41. Our North America region is having a good year in terms of balanced financial delivery. We now are bad full commercial activity and feel confident in our ability to execute. Snacks should finish the year solidly in growth, while Frozen is expected to continue to finish with improved performance. We are off to an earlier-than-expected start to margin recovery in this region even as we reinvest more in our brands. And with the spin-off, we become that much more focused and streamlined behind snacks and frozen foods. Simply put, North America too is ready to start our new era as Kellanova.  So let me summarize with Slide number 43. The third quarter closes the books on the 117-year-old Kellogg Company and does so in a solid way. In spite of rising elasticities across the industry, we continue to deliver good top line growth while getting our service levels back to where they should be and continuing to restore profit margins faster than we had anticipated. And we delivered all that while executing the spin-off of W.K. Kellogg Co. During the quarter, we made all the final preparations to ensure business continuity and the sustained success of both companies. Our company and the company-parallel operations were successful, and our transition services agreements are in place and in operation. And we now enter the Kellanova era from a position of strength. We're back to full commercial activity. Our free cash flow and balance sheet are strong, giving us good financial flexibility. We are proactively mitigating stranded margins. And we have a plan that should continue to deliver the kind of financial algorithm that you would expect from a portfolio that is weighted towards snacking, emerging markets and highly differentiated brands. In sum, we are on track and ready to deliver as Kellanova. So in closing, I want to first express a heartfelt congratulations and thank you to our entire family of Kellogg employees for the tireless efforts and endless passion that went into executing the spin-off and creating such a promising future for both companies. We wish our former colleagues all the best as they embark on their next chapter as W.K. Kellogg Co. And to our Kellanova employees, I share in your excitement for our future. We entered this new era with a more growth-oriented portfolio, a sharpened strategy and more ambitious financial expectations, and we have just the team to deliver on it. And now, we'll be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJason English: Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for spotting me in. A couple of questions in regards\nAmit Banati: Hi, Jason.\nJason English: Hey guys. A couple of questions in regards to your reiteration of long-term algo for next year. First, you gave a base -- estimated base earnings number at your Analyst Day of around 3 35 for this year. Is that still the right base to use?\nAmit Banati: I think, Jason, we will update the details when we get to our normal cycle in February once we've had this year's actual latest foreign exchange rates. So I think we'll update the absolutes as we kind of get to February. We're right in the middle of our budgeting process right now. But as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we fully expect to be on our algorithm growth rates we had shared in August.\nJason English: Okay. But that 3 35 number for this year, even though we're 10 months through, may not be a good number to anchor to. Is that -- did I -- am I hearing that right?\nAmit Banati: No, we are on track, I mean, from a 2023 standpoint, right? We are ahead of pace in the first nine months. And like I mentioned, we are on track from a 2023 standpoint. So we'll share the specific details when we get to February.\nJohn Renwick: But that we gave for 2023, as we indicated at that time, that was for a full year estimate of what Kellanova might look like. It's not quite the real what you'll see us report because we'll have three quarters of Kellogg Company and one quarter of Kellanova. So, that was just a way for you to calculate.\nJason English: Yes, which is why I'm still trying to anchor to it just because as is evident in today's press release, it's really muddy, right? There's a lot of noise here. So, I'm just trying to keep it simple. Okay. And sticking with the long-term--\nAmit Banati: From an underlying business performance, right, we are right on track with -- on 2023.\nJason English: Yes, that's good to hear. And I think it came through our results, but there is a lot of noise. And sticking with the long-term algo, I think Steve mentioned this upfront. Your diversified business with a diversified global footprint and you've got long-term algo by each segment, but there time where some are going to lag and some are going to do better. And it now feels like it's one of those points in time where the developed world, particularly North America, is lagging. I don't think it's structural, but at a moment in time, your emerging market businesses are doing quite well. Investors are concerned that you're not going to able to hit LTL algo across all segments next year. Is it reasonable to say that? That shouldn't be a concern. You don't need to LTL algo across all segments next year. It could look very much like what we're seeing right now, where perhaps North America does lag, but the strength you have elsewhere could offset that. Or do you actually -- do you really expect and are you entering to a return to a long-term algo in North America?\nSteve Cahillane: I think a couple of things, Jason. You're exactly right. We don't need to be on long-term algo in all regions in order to make it corporately because power of the portfolio. Having said that, I think what you're seeing in North America, just to put it in context, we did return to merchandising activity later than most. That was purposeful. In hindsight, perhaps we could have come sooner. But we're back now. We were also going through obviously the spin, which was a massive amount of work. And so as we approach 2024, we look to North America with much more optimism in terms of turning back to quality merchandising activity. The strength of our brands, we know, is there, very, very strong. We were lagging in innovation for the same reasons, so holding back to get our supply chain back to where we wanted it to be. So, we've got a much more ambitious innovation plan in 2024. So, as we look at North America in 2023, a series of events, obviously led by the spin, but also, again, measured return to innovation and merchandising activity, will all be very different in 2024. So, we have more confidence in our long-term algo in North America, which bolsters our confidence in our long-term algo overall as a company.\nJason English: Appreciate it. Thank you guys. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi from RBC. Your line is now open, please go ahead.\nNik Modi: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Steve, I was hoping you could comment on volume growth. Obviously, revenue has been very strong driven by pricing, but volumes continue to lag. Some of your global snacking peers have actually posted volume growth. So, I just wanted to get some context from you on how you're thinking about that. And then just a second question, and this is more of a kind of an abstract question that I was just thinking about. One of the big growth drivers in the future for Kellanova will be white space and global expansion with some of your existing brands. And I wondered if, do you have global P&Ls for your key brands? Or is that something that still needs to be developed as you spin out the company? Thanks.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes, Nik. So, I would say on the volume question, clearly, when you take the type of pricing that we've taken, mid-teens pricing on top of mid-teens pricing a year ago, you're going to have elasticities. The difference from -- for us relative to some competition, as I mentioned earlier, we did return to merchandising activity later than most. We did return -- we're returning to innovation activity later than most. That's a fact. And obviously, we had the spin as well as those other items, which leads us to be much more optimistic about 2024. There's nothing structural in our volumes or our performance or our brand health that points to anything other than optimism in 2024 and beyond. In terms of white space, the global P&L, yes, we track in detail the financial performance of all of our brands at a SKU level and at a geographic level, so a very good understanding of that.\nNik Modi: Excellent. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Palmer of Evercore ISI. David, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDavid Palmer: Thank you. Good morning. Question on the fourth quarter. You mentioned organic revenue growth would be within algo. I assume that'd be 2% to 4% up, including the Russia drag. And I'm also wondering, how you're thinking about a 4Q sales breakdown between North America and other segments. And the reason I'm asking about that is really the scanner data quarter-to-date. It shows down roughly 4.5% in what we see in terms of US measured channels. So, it would look like you would have to be pretty heavy lifting for international for that to stay that way and for that to reflect what sort of organic revenue growth you'd have in North America in 4Q or put a lot of burden on international. So any thoughts about what we're seeing there or thoughts about improvement in North America, what we're seeing is not real or perhaps any particularly strong growth internationally would be helpful.\nAmit Banati: Yes. I think similar trends to what we are seeing right now from a quarter four standpoint, if you exclude WKKC from the base, the Russia divestiture would be about a 1% negative impact and then currency translation around 3%. So, I think if you kind of exclude those 3%, you get to the -- you get to our algo growth of somewhere between 3% to 5% for the overall business. We would expect international to grow faster than the US in the next quarter. We continue to expect price elasticities. That's always been in our guidance, so we expect that to continue. We'd expect volume to be down, but for the decline to moderate in quarter 4 as we get back to full merchandising, particularly in the US. So that's kind of the shape of what we're expecting in quarter 4.\nDavid Palmer: My follow-up to that is, if it's down -- if North America were down 4%, then the international would have to be something like up 10%. So that's why I'm asking. It just seems like you must be expecting North America to improve from now. I know back at the Analyst Day in August, you were talking about merchandising activity for Cheez-It and some marketing coming through. So I'm wondering, are you expecting a meaningful improvement? Or do you expect that sort of heavy lifting from international?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. I was going to say it's a lot like quarter 3. And you can see in the scanner data that we did return to merchandising activity. We haven't yet gotten the quality display activity that we're now seeing. So you're going to see a gradual improvement going into Q1 of 2024 as well.\nDavid Palmer: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nKen Goldman: Hi. Thank you. With the caveat that you're not quite ready to talk about certain details in 2024 yet, The Street is -- and it's great to hear that you're expecting an on-algo year. But The Street is looking for volume growth as soon as the second quarter of next year, and I wasn't quite sure if that was reasonable. And I don't know, if I'm asking a question that you can even answer at this point in time. But I'm -- my hope is that Street numbers can maybe be a little more reasonable at some point. If that's the case, just given some of that -- you'll still have some pricing flowing through and there's still certain challenges around the world, I just wouldn't want people to come out and have numbers that are too high and disappointed. So I didn't know if you could talk about that at this point, if there's any kind of commentary you could provide on volume growth into next year at this time, given the lack of visibility, I understand.\nAmit Banati: Yeah. Like I said, we're working through our budgeting process right now. I think we'd expect a gradual return to volume growth in 2024. Obviously, as you start lapping some of the price increases and some of the volume in quarter three, the laps get easier. But that's probably the shape of how we're looking at 2024 right now.\nKen Goldman: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lavery: Hey, good morning. You touched on some of the margin drivers, the pricing now offsetting inflation better, the productivity, the normalization of where the supply chain disruptions had been. Can you maybe give a sense of order of magnitude or -- really trying to understand what are the most sustainable and how to think about looking ahead. And then part of that, is there any way to quantify -- you mentioned some of the additional costs from the parallel operations but still had -- against our expectations, still a nice margin performance. Can you quantify some of that? Was that significant and obviously lapping that? Or are you putting that in the rearview? How much of a lift should that be looking ahead as well?\nAmit Banati: Yes. So I think in terms of gross margin, I think you hit on the two biggest items, right? So it is pricing, catching our presentation, and it is a much better performing supply chain. So those two are the biggest drivers of the gross margin improvement and it's been coming in better than what we had expected and faster than what we had expected. So more of a timing in terms of the catch-up happening faster than what we have planned for. So -- and I think in terms of -- the parallel costs, we did incur some parallel costs in quarter three for -- as we kind of ran value operations. I think that's now behind us post-spin. I wouldn't say, it's a significant lap item for next year. So we did incur costs, but they weren't really significant from a lap standpoint.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. That's helpful. And just a follow-up on your color on the consumer, just in the release and prepared remarks talking about how they're stretched or elasticities are getting sharper. Can you just maybe give us a sense of how much visibility you have on the broader dynamic in terms of trading down from food away from home? That would, in theory, give a lift to packaged food, but then obviously, the pressure you are seeing with either trade-down, just some of the consumer dynamics and where that all nets out for you? And we've seen in this quarter, obviously, what that looked like, but maybe some of what you expect in the fourth quarter or looking ahead. Is it better? Is it worse? Is it more of the same? You touched a little bit on the volume thoughts for 2024. But just curious for the consumer perspective behind that, that you see as the real driver.\nSteve Cahillane: Yeah. Michael, I'd say the consumer is clearly strained. There's evidence of that. There's some degree of channel shifting. There's some degree of trading down to smaller sizes. There is definitely a traffic pattern when they're shopping, more trips, all those types of things. Having said all that, though, I think the overarching line is still the resilience of the consumer. And particularly for our categories, we're talking about affordable luxuries. We've talked about that in the past. And we're not really seeing any meaningful shift to private label or anything that points to a structural change in consumer dynamics. And we've said this in the past, when you take the type of pricing, you're talking about 30-plus percent pricing over the last 18 months, the type of volume decline that we've seen in aggregate is still much smaller than you would otherwise expect. We've seen it more recently, obviously, in a real catch-up. But I think we're probably at the high watermark in terms of elasticities. As we go into next year, we're lapping a lot of this pricing. Consumers are becoming much more used to different price points. We talked about our return to quality merchandising, a lot of things to believe are going to point to a good industry environment, despite all the macro pressures that are well understood and that are putting pressure on the consumer.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Max Gumport of BNP Paribas. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMax Gumport: Hey. Thanks for the question. Just on the volume in North America. You've given some color already. I know you've touched on the slower return to merchandising and innovation and also the lapping of trade inventory build last year. So I was just hoping you could maybe quantify some of those buckets in terms of just order of magnitude. How much of the decline was due to the lap? How much was due to the lower return? And then maybe how much is due to just slower category growth or share performance? I realize this is all very tough to do, just hoping for a bit more color there. Thanks very much.\nSteve Cahillane: Yeah. Max, I think just directionally, the big buckets are the merchandising activity and the pricing and the innovation. Those are really the three big buckets, all entirely controllable as we look to the future. The pricing, we're lapping; the innovation, we've got a better plan; the merchandising activity, we're returning. So that's why I say, when we look at the health of our brands, we're very encouraged because you're talking about Pringles, Rice Krispies Treats, Cheez-It, these are big power brands that are loved by the consumer, showing no signs of diminution with consumer loyalty. And so those are the three items that really make up the biggest buckets that's pressured volume up to this point.\nMax Gumport: Got it. And then one more on the US, there was a large grocery retailer this morning that reported results, and they called out that they now have evidence that the emergency allotments of Snap rolling off, maybe have been a bigger impact than expected. I think their numbers were -- initially would have expected the minus 200 basis point impact on sales, and now it's looking more like a minus 400 basis point impact on sales growth. Just curious if you're seeing a similar type of impact among your lower-income consumers.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. I haven't seen those results yet. But SNAP is obviously one part of the elasticity story. We've taken, as an industry, significant pricing while the consumer has been under pressure. And so I think it's probably -- you're seeing that in the overall elasticities. What SNAP is -- it's hard to quantify for us, but we'll certainly study what you've just mentioned.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, thanks operator. Good morning, everyone. I just had one -- just wanted to ask one clarification and I have a question. In the appendix of the Day at K presentation, there are hard currency-neutral dollar targets for sales and EBIT by segment. So just the -- I'm just trying to understand, is -- are those not valid anymore? Just because you reiterated coming on algorithm for 2024 but didn't really address the hard targets. So I just want to make sure we should be still -- should we still be using those as a guide as we're modeling for 2024?\nAmit Banati: Yes. So I think, Bryan, we'll give you the details when we close out 2023, right? I think from a growth rate standpoint, like I said, we fully expect to be on long-term growth algorithm for 2024. I think as you'd appreciate, right, currencies will be different when we close out 2023 versus the assumptions that we had made in August. Like I had mentioned on 2023, we are -- at the end of nine months, we are ahead of pace versus the guidance that we had given. And so where we close out from a 2023 standpoint. So I think those kind of pace and currency adjustments would cause the absolute to differ, but we were right in the middle of that work as part of our budget. And I fully expect our long-term growth rates to be on algorithm.\nBryan Spillane: I guess -- but those ranges are currency-neutral that you provided. So I don't know maybe the accounting is changing. It's just -- so I guess, we'll wait till February to get it but...\nAmit Banati: Yes. So it's currency-neutral, right? The overall rates that we had given for the company included a view of currency, right? So that's for the total Kellogg Company, the ones that we had given in our preliminary 2024 guidance. Where there are currency-neutral numbers, those won't be impacted by those view of the long-term rates. But the rates number base change, right, depending on where we end up on 2023.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. And then just you talked about margins kind of recovery happening a little bit faster than normal. So again, there was an implied margin that is just under 14%, I guess, the middle of that range, currency-neutral next year. So should we -- is it possible that since you're running ahead, we could even be a little bit further ahead in terms of margin recovery for next year?\nAmit Banati: Yes. We talked that as we kind of complete the budgeting process, Bryan. I think it's a bit premature for me to comment on that. But yes, margin recovery is recovering faster. You'll see that in our results. And we'll give you the specifics on 2024 when we get to it.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nAmit Banati: Good morning, Alexia.\nAlexia Howard: Hi, there. So a couple of questions here. You mentioned a couple of times that you were late coming back with merchandising and promotional activity and that, therefore, it was quite a bit lower in the first half of 2023 than your normal run rate would be. Does that mean that the lap that lower promotional period in 2024 that in the developed markets, we could actually see pricing modestly down? I don't know about the timing of the price increases, but I'm just wondering how we should think about that cadence.\nSteve Cahillane: No, I wouldn't say you'd see pricing down. I think you just see a return to quality merchandising off of what are inescapably higher list prices. And so that's really the dynamic that you'll see.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much. That's clear. And then on the leverage, it looks as though your leverage is fairly comfortable at the moment, probably around 2.4, 2.5x if -- at $600 million on with W.K. Kellogg. How does that mean you make or where does that put you in terms of M&A aspirations, particularly on the acquisition side? And if you were thinking about further deals, which geographies and what type of criteria would you be thinking about on that front?\nAmit Banati: Yes. So firstly, I think, we like the organic opportunity that's in front of us. And I think despite the short-term volume discussion, right, I think the growth potential of our portfolio is strong. We've got plenty of organic growth opportunities. I think from a capital allocation standpoint, prioritizing investments into the organic opportunity, particularly in capacity expansion in Pringles in emerging markets, is kind of the immediate priority. We'd always evaluate M&A opportunities, I think largely in the areas of snacking and emerging markets. So if something -- we run a very disciplined process, and so we continue to evaluate opportunities come.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much. I will pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Dickerson of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. \nRobert Dickerson: Hi. Great. Thanks so much. Steve, I just wanted to ask about the -- some of the volume impacts around -- I think you said some changes to price pack architecture and also SKU rationalization. So maybe if you could just kind of dive into that, just a little bit more in detail. I'm not sure if that's kind of across the overall global portfolio or if it's more North America-based and kind of what's driving that rationalization in the near-term. And then, I guess, as we think about next year, is it -- yes, we have this better base with rationalization fully coming through in 2023, and we should be able to end that by the end of this year, which, therefore, allows us some higher probability volume growth next year? Thanks.\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. So a couple of things, Rob. First, the biggest impact was in Latin America, where we made very purposeful SKU reductions, price package architecture to improve profitability. And we're very pleased with the program and how that worked out. In North America, there's also elements. We've gotten out of some lower-margin cracker business, for example. We did rationalize SKUs when we had severe shortages and bottlenecks and -- last year to get better performance in the plants. And so we'll be lapping that. But biggest headline is definitely Latin America followed North America.\nRobert Dickerson: Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then just secondly, kind of quickly, on the pricing side. Pricing clearly is still part of the top-line. I think Alexia said, I'm not sure exactly how many rounds have gone in and kind of what time on a per segment basis. But as we think through into 2024 \u2013 excuse me, and may be this pertains a little bit more to some of the emerging markets, do you foresee kind of incremental pricing needs? Doesn't sound like that's something many of us are discussing at this point. But like, when I look at AMEA, kind of pricing relative to currency, maybe there are some opportunities. Maybe there can be some incremental pricing potential in certain geographies. Thanks.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. I'd say a couple of things. First, in the developed markets, we're looking at a more benign inflationary environment going forward. And we certainly feel like the consumer has taken enough pricing and are working hard to mitigate any potential needs to take more pricing going forward. And again, returning to quality merchandising means promotional activity and benefits to the consumer. In the emerging markets, generally, every year, we're going to be taking pricing. Whether that\u2019d be currency, whether that\u2019d be inflation, just cost of doing business, that's fairly routine. And we see the same thing happening in our emerging markets for next year, although not to the same levels that we've seen over the course of the last two years. And we'll exercise all the RGM levers that we have in those emerging markets to maintain affordability, to maintain -- in the shopping baskets of our consumers in the emerging markets. But it's more of a -- I would say, a more normalized environment in emerging markets relative to the past two years. But that doesn't mean deflationary and it doesn't mean flat. It means just more measured price increases going forward.\nRobert Dickerson: All right. Great. Make sense. Thank you.\nJohn Renwick: And we may have time for one last question, if it\u2019s there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nSteve Powers: Okay. Great. Maybe just a pick up on that last question from Rob, specific to AMEA. For a while, pricing was running well above the currency headwinds. So, you were seeing double-digit US dollar growth. Now pricing is running below. So you're seeing the double-digit organic growth, but you're seeing kind of double-digit declines in US dollars. So could you frame for us what's going on there? Maybe give us a little bit more of a tutorial around sort of timing of when pricing has been or can be taken in that market relative to currency fluctuations? And then just how you -- net of all that, how you're thinking about kind of real growth in that market in dollar terms over time? Thank you.\nAmit Banati : Yes. So I think the easiest way to think about it is there's a lag between the devaluation that happens on an operating transaction basis and when the official rate moved. But we've been seeing the devaluation of the naira on the ground from an operating basis all the way through 2022, first half of 2023 and have been taking pricing to cover that. And I think the business has done a remarkable job taking multiple rounds of price. And the great news, and it's a testament just to the strength of our brand and our route to market, that despite the pricing that we've taken, volumes have held up and our shares have held up. So that's been happening. And like you said, we've been seeing that come through with elevated growth rates through 2022 into the first half of 2023. Then you have the devaluation that happened in the last quarter. And so the transaction and the translation have gotten more in sync as a result of that. And so that's why now you're seeing a bit of a lag. I mean the business continues to be growing at double-digit rates and we continue to take pricing, but there is a lag that's kind of flowing in, in the way it's go through in the P&L. But I think from an overall standpoint, a strong route to market, taking the pricing to cover our margins through this whole cycle, we protected our margins. And that's been the focus of the team, and we've done that volumes of hand.\nSteve Powers : Okay, okay. That's great. And just real quick, you talked about similar currency headwinds in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. So we take that to mean around about like a $0.04 drag on EPS from FX?\nAmit Banati : Well, EPS has been -- it's been a help to EPS. That's the reference there was from a top line standpoint, about a 3% drag the top line growth. EPS was actually positive in the -- in quarter three, right? And so -- yes. But I think from a top line standpoint, about a 3% hit to the top line. And from an EPS, I'd say, using the exchange that we have, probably flattish. So much more impact on the top line than the EPS.\nSteve Powers : Understood. Thank you very much.\nJohn Renwick: Okay. Operator, we are at time. So thank you, everyone, for your interest. And please do not hesitate to call if you do have follow-up questions.\nOperator: Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve Cahillane",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. While our quarter three results predated the spin-off, it is exciting to be talking to you as Kellanova for the first time. It bears reminding that Kellanova is a strengthened portfolio with the business, brands and geographies that make Kellanova a global snacks-led powerhouse. As shown on Slide number 5, over 80% of our annual net sales comes from snacks and emerging markets, both of which have been and will continue to be above-average growth categories and markets. Half of our net sales come from five highly differentiated brands, Pringles, Cheez-It, Pop-Tarts, Rice Krispie Treats and Eggo, that offer above-average growth and accretive economics. And we generate half of our revenue from outside of the United States and Canada, giving us geographic diversification, global reach, access to fast-growing emerging markets and the opportunity to expand big United States brands into international markets. And when you see temporary softness in one market, it can be offset elsewhere, which is precisely what we saw in the third quarter. Kellanova is also a company with a sharpened strategy, one that better suits a global snacking powerhouse, while still emphasizing the capabilities that enable us to win in the marketplace, protect our planet and serve our communities, and deliver attractive and dependable financial returns. This strategy appropriately called differentiate, drive and deliver is shown on Slide number 6. But before we enter the Kellanova era, let's talk about our final quarter as Kellogg Company on Slide number 7. We turned in another good performance in the third quarter. Organic net sales growth was sustained at an on-algorithm pace despite a challenging environment marked by a financially strained consumer and the long-awaited return toward normal levels of elasticities. We're pleased with our continued restoration of gross profit margins. As service levels have returned to normal levels, productivity initiatives are delivering savings and pricing has caught up with input cost inflation. And this enabled us to deliver above-algorithm growth in operating profit even as we increased our brand building at a double-digit rate. Our free cash flow was strong, ahead of last year, even with upfront outlays related to the spin-off. And speaking of the spin-off, we executed it with excellence. So it was another busy and successful quarter, and we are heading into the Kellanova era from a position of strength. Externally, the focus lately has been less about our improved portfolio strategy and long-term growth prospects and much more about current industry dynamics. Fair enough, but I would remind everyone that most of what we are seeing today from decelerating cost inflation to restoration of service levels and margins, to a return to normal levels of elasticities have been in our budget, our guidance and our commentary for quite some time. This is illustrated on slide number 8. The decelerated net sales growth was inevitable because after significant cumulative price increases, including right through the second quarter of 2023, there was going to be a return to typical levels of elasticities in our industry. And across our categories and across our regions, we have seen this rise in elasticities every quarter this year. We don't think this is about price gaps over private label, which largely remain below 2019 levels. And the relatively small shares of private label in our categories remain around their 2019 levels. We did have a couple of additional factors that impacted our volumes in the quarter, but again, these were anticipated. One was lapping trade inventory replenishment from last year, notably in North America cereal and snacks and the other, also in North America, was our decision to delay merchandising activity earlier this year in order to gain full confidence in our return to high service levels, particularly given the lead time required for quality display activity. This caused us some volume in the second and third quarter. But by the latter part of quarter three, we had returned in merchandising, and we expect quality display activity to follow. In short, these conditions and timing differences will pass. Our brand-building investment is increasing. We are returning to merchandising, and we are ramping back up our innovation. We will return to more balanced volume and price/mix within our net sales growth over time, accompanied by sustained improvement in profit margins. Meantime, our brands remain in great shape. And our focus remains on growing our biggest, most differentiated brands around the world. Shown on slide number 9, these brands accounted for half of Kellanova's net sales in 2022 and a little more than that so far in 2023 as their growth continues to outpace the rest of the portfolio. In the quarter and year-to-date periods, we increased brand-building investment behind these advantaged brands at strong double-digit rates year-on-year, faster than the rest of the portfolio. As we prioritize investment behind these brands, we expect them to continue to lead our growth and contribute positively to margin mix. Our focus is also on growing the right way, and slide number 10 shows some of the ways our Better Days Promise program manifested itself during the third quarter. We unveiled new, more ambitious targets for Kellanova, sustained our legacy of helping our communities and found ways to link these activities to our commercial endeavors, and we continue to be recognized for our efforts. So let me now turn it over to Amit, who will walk you through our financials, before I come back and discuss each of our businesses in more detail. Thanks, Amit. Slide number 23 splits our portfolio into category groups to help remind you of their relative sizes and how Kellanova's portfolio is clearly oriented toward growth. Beginning in the fourth quarter, Kellanova will no longer have the North America cereal portion nor the very small Caribbean cereal portion of international cereal. As you can see on the slide, the businesses that will remain with Kellanova continue to drive most of our growth in quarter three. As we walk through our regions, which is how we are structured, we will once again organize our discussion around the businesses that comprise Kellanova first, followed by the North America cereal business that is now part of W.K. Kellogg Co. We'll start with the region's most exposed to emerging markets. Slide number 24 shows the financial performance of our AMEA region. Once again, this region generated double-digit organic net sales growth on top of extremely strong comparisons. It again expanded its operating profit margin year-on-year in the third quarter and it again posted exceptional profit growth, up 14% on an adjusted and currency-neutral basis. And this profit was delivered in spite of high cost inflation and substantial reinvestment into the business. Within AMEA, we see on slide number 25 that snacks turned in another quarter of double-digit organic growth in net sales. This organic growth was again broad-based across Australia, Asia and Africa and the Middle East. In market, Pringles continues to gain share in the region with notably strong outperformance relative to the category this quarter in Australia and Japan. As shown on Slide 26, AMEA cereal also sustained growth in the third quarter in spite of lapping elevated year ago growth. Growth was broad-based with notable growth in Australia, Africa and Southeast Asia. And in market, our overall share gain in the region was led by notably strong performance in Korea and New Zealand. And then we come to noodles and others shown on Slide number 27. This business continues to post exceptional growth even as it begins to lap substantial price increases taken last year to offset cost inflation and weakened currencies. Our business in Nigeria continues to grow strongly, owing to the strength of Dufil's brands and the huge competitive advantage of our distributor arm Multipro. We also continue to expand our Kellogg's noodle business outside of Nigeria. AMEA enters the Kellanova era with solid momentum. For the full year, we continue to expect to sustain strong growth across all three category groups, delivering yet another year of organic net sales growth. And we plan to do that while restoring our profit margins and investing for the future. Now let's look at our other emerging markets region, Latin America, starting on Slide number 29. Kellogg Latin America in quarter three delivered another quarter of strong organic net sales growth on top of exceptionally strong growth last year. This organic growth was once again led by our two largest markets, Mexico and Brazil, though our Pacific subregion also putted strong growth. It's important to note that roughly half of our volume decline, both in the third quarter and year-to-date, was attributable to price pack architecture changes and SKU rationalization that we have undertaken to improve profitability. We again expanded our operating margin in quarter three, leading to a fourth straight quarter of operating profit growth of 20% or better. On Slide number 30, we see that our snacks business in Latin America generated strong organic net sales growth in the third quarter, led by sustained momentum in Mexico and Brazil. Both of those markets saw double-digit category growth in salty snacks, and Pringles gained share in both of these key markets. And in portable wholesome snacks, we continue to outpace the category in Mexico. On Slide number 31, you can see that Kellogg Latin America grew net sales organically again in cereal in spite of lapping exceptional growth in the year ago quarter. This growth was led by Mexico and our Pacific subregion. Keep in mind that a sliver of this business, our Caribbean cereal business, has since been spun off with W.K. Kellogg Co., but this business represented only about 5% of our Latin America cereal business last year, so it is quite small. So Latin America is performing well as it heads into the Kellanova era. For the full year, we continue to expect this region to sustain strong top line momentum with growth in both snacks and cereal and continued recovery in its profit margins. Once again, we can see that both of our emerging markets regions are showing current momentum to go with their outstanding long-term prospects. Now let's turn to our developed markets regions, starting with Kellogg Europe and Slide number 33. This region sustained yet another quarter of strong organic net sales growth on top of strong year-earlier growth. Operating profit increased sharply year-on-year, owing to good top line growth, moderating cost pressures and solid margin expansion, all of which more than offset the impact of divesting Russia earlier in the quarter. If we look deeper into the business, on Slide number 34, you can see that snacks, which represents over half of our sales in Kellogg Europe, continue to lead our growth in this region. In fact, quarter three marked the quarter in the last 11 in which we have posted double-digit organic net sales growth in our European snacks business. The growth in quarter three also continued to be broad based with double-digit gains in all three of our sub-regions. In markets, salty snacks category remains in double-digit growth overall with Pringles outpacing the category in markets like the UK, France, Spain, Italy and Poland. And in portable wholesome snacks, category growth rates have accelerated into the double-digits. And we continued to gain substantial share in the UK, led by double-digit growth in Rice Krispies Squares. Our cereal business in Europe, shown on Slide number 35, posted a small organic decline in net sales in the third quarter. As we've discussed previously, this business has slowed owing to the rising category elasticities. But we are confident in our quarter four plans, which includes incremental brand building shifted from previous quarters. So it was another strong quarter for Kellogg Europe. For the full year, we continue to expect the region to post yet another year of solid top line growth led by snacks. We also remain on track to deliver improved margins during the second half in spite of sustained cost pressures. Our divestiture of our business in Russia was a necessary move in an unfortunate situation. But overall, this region is showing good momentum as it heads into the Kellanova era. We'll now turn to Kellogg North America in Slide number 37. As anticipated, net sales growth has decelerated in recent quarters as elasticity continued to move higher and as we begin to lap last year's sizable replenishment of trade inventories. However, we continue to recover gross profit margin, reflecting productivity, revenue growth management and diminishing bottlenecks and shortages. This enabled us to substantially increase investment in our brands and still deliver high single-digit operating profit growth year-on-year in the third quarter. The rise in elasticities, as well as the lapping of last year's strong growth in inventory replenishment can be seen in all three category groups in the third quarter. Slide number 38 shows snacks, which represents over half of our North America net sales. In the third quarter, its net sales were up very slightly against a very big quarter last year. In market, all three of our snacks categories experienced rising elasticities, particularly in higher cash outlay items like multipacks. In addition, we took a more measured approach than many in restoring merchandising activity. It was a similar story in frozen foods, shown on Slide number 39. Our frozen foods net sales were flat in the third quarter. Like snacks, our Eggo business faced a rise in category elasticities. In addition, our Morningstar Farms brand continued to feel the impact of a shakeout in the plant-based category even as it continued to gain share. Now let's turn to our North America cereal business, which forms most of what is now W.K. Kellogg Co. You will get more detail from W.K. Kellogg Co. in its own earnings release. But as shown on Slide number 40, this business faced the same dynamics as the Kellanova businesses in the third quarter: flattish sales, reflecting a continued rise in category elasticities and the lapping of strong year-ago growth. Turning to Slide number 41. Our North America region is having a good year in terms of balanced financial delivery. We now are bad full commercial activity and feel confident in our ability to execute. Snacks should finish the year solidly in growth, while Frozen is expected to continue to finish with improved performance. We are off to an earlier-than-expected start to margin recovery in this region even as we reinvest more in our brands. And with the spin-off, we become that much more focused and streamlined behind snacks and frozen foods. Simply put, North America too is ready to start our new era as Kellanova.  So let me summarize with Slide number 43. The third quarter closes the books on the 117-year-old Kellogg Company and does so in a solid way. In spite of rising elasticities across the industry, we continue to deliver good top line growth while getting our service levels back to where they should be and continuing to restore profit margins faster than we had anticipated. And we delivered all that while executing the spin-off of W.K. Kellogg Co. During the quarter, we made all the final preparations to ensure business continuity and the sustained success of both companies. Our company and the company-parallel operations were successful, and our transition services agreements are in place and in operation. And we now enter the Kellanova era from a position of strength. We're back to full commercial activity. Our free cash flow and balance sheet are strong, giving us good financial flexibility. We are proactively mitigating stranded margins. And we have a plan that should continue to deliver the kind of financial algorithm that you would expect from a portfolio that is weighted towards snacking, emerging markets and highly differentiated brands. In sum, we are on track and ready to deliver as Kellanova. So in closing, I want to first express a heartfelt congratulations and thank you to our entire family of Kellogg employees for the tireless efforts and endless passion that went into executing the spin-off and creating such a promising future for both companies. We wish our former colleagues all the best as they embark on their next chapter as W.K. Kellogg Co. And to our Kellanova employees, I share in your excitement for our future. We entered this new era with a more growth-oriented portfolio, a sharpened strategy and more ambitious financial expectations, and we have just the team to deliver on it. And now, we'll be happy to take your questions. I think a couple of things, Jason. You're exactly right. We don't need to be on long-term algo in all regions in order to make it corporately because power of the portfolio. Having said that, I think what you're seeing in North America, just to put it in context, we did return to merchandising activity later than most. That was purposeful. In hindsight, perhaps we could have come sooner. But we're back now. We were also going through obviously the spin, which was a massive amount of work. And so as we approach 2024, we look to North America with much more optimism in terms of turning back to quality merchandising activity. The strength of our brands, we know, is there, very, very strong. We were lagging in innovation for the same reasons, so holding back to get our supply chain back to where we wanted it to be. So, we've got a much more ambitious innovation plan in 2024. So, as we look at North America in 2023, a series of events, obviously led by the spin, but also, again, measured return to innovation and merchandising activity, will all be very different in 2024. So, we have more confidence in our long-term algo in North America, which bolsters our confidence in our long-term algo overall as a company. Yes, Nik. So, I would say on the volume question, clearly, when you take the type of pricing that we've taken, mid-teens pricing on top of mid-teens pricing a year ago, you're going to have elasticities. The difference from -- for us relative to some competition, as I mentioned earlier, we did return to merchandising activity later than most. We did return -- we're returning to innovation activity later than most. That's a fact. And obviously, we had the spin as well as those other items, which leads us to be much more optimistic about 2024. There's nothing structural in our volumes or our performance or our brand health that points to anything other than optimism in 2024 and beyond. In terms of white space, the global P&L, yes, we track in detail the financial performance of all of our brands at a SKU level and at a geographic level, so a very good understanding of that. Yes. I was going to say it's a lot like quarter 3. And you can see in the scanner data that we did return to merchandising activity. We haven't yet gotten the quality display activity that we're now seeing. So you're going to see a gradual improvement going into Q1 of 2024 as well. Yeah. Michael, I'd say the consumer is clearly strained. There's evidence of that. There's some degree of channel shifting. There's some degree of trading down to smaller sizes. There is definitely a traffic pattern when they're shopping, more trips, all those types of things. Having said all that, though, I think the overarching line is still the resilience of the consumer. And particularly for our categories, we're talking about affordable luxuries. We've talked about that in the past. And we're not really seeing any meaningful shift to private label or anything that points to a structural change in consumer dynamics. And we've said this in the past, when you take the type of pricing, you're talking about 30-plus percent pricing over the last 18 months, the type of volume decline that we've seen in aggregate is still much smaller than you would otherwise expect. We've seen it more recently, obviously, in a real catch-up. But I think we're probably at the high watermark in terms of elasticities. As we go into next year, we're lapping a lot of this pricing. Consumers are becoming much more used to different price points. We talked about our return to quality merchandising, a lot of things to believe are going to point to a good industry environment, despite all the macro pressures that are well understood and that are putting pressure on the consumer. Yeah. Max, I think just directionally, the big buckets are the merchandising activity and the pricing and the innovation. Those are really the three big buckets, all entirely controllable as we look to the future. The pricing, we're lapping; the innovation, we've got a better plan; the merchandising activity, we're returning. So that's why I say, when we look at the health of our brands, we're very encouraged because you're talking about Pringles, Rice Krispies Treats, Cheez-It, these are big power brands that are loved by the consumer, showing no signs of diminution with consumer loyalty. And so those are the three items that really make up the biggest buckets that's pressured volume up to this point. Yes. I haven't seen those results yet. But SNAP is obviously one part of the elasticity story. We've taken, as an industry, significant pricing while the consumer has been under pressure. And so I think it's probably -- you're seeing that in the overall elasticities. What SNAP is -- it's hard to quantify for us, but we'll certainly study what you've just mentioned. No, I wouldn't say you'd see pricing down. I think you just see a return to quality merchandising off of what are inescapably higher list prices. And so that's really the dynamic that you'll see. Yes. I'd say a couple of things. First, in the developed markets, we're looking at a more benign inflationary environment going forward. And we certainly feel like the consumer has taken enough pricing and are working hard to mitigate any potential needs to take more pricing going forward. And again, returning to quality merchandising means promotional activity and benefits to the consumer. In the emerging markets, generally, every year, we're going to be taking pricing. Whether that'd be currency, whether that'd be inflation, just cost of doing business, that's fairly routine. And we see the same thing happening in our emerging markets for next year, although not to the same levels that we've seen over the course of the last two years. And we'll exercise all the RGM levers that we have in those emerging markets to maintain affordability, to maintain -- in the shopping baskets of our consumers in the emerging markets. But it's more of a -- I would say, a more normalized environment in emerging markets relative to the past two years. But that doesn't mean deflationary and it doesn't mean flat. It means just more measured price increases going forward."

            "name": "Amit Banati",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Slide number 12 summarizes the results of Kellogg Company because the spin-off occurred after the quarter ended. Net sales increased by about 4% on an organic basis in quarter three, which is right on the second half pace implied by our full year guidance. Year-to-date, this translates into 8% organic growth. Operating profit increased by 10% on an adjusted and currency-neutral basis, sustaining double-digit growth in spite of higher A&P investment and the divestiture of our Russia business. Year-to-date, this translates to 14% growth, which is ahead of the pace implied by our full year guidance. Earnings per share on an adjusted and currency-neutral basis decreased by about 2% year-on-year in quarter three and increased by 2% year-to-date. This is ahead of the pace implied by our full year guidance, delivering year-on-year growth in spite of some 11 to 12 percentage points of headwind from macroeconomic factors driving higher interest expense and lower pension income. And free cash flow came in at $894 million, which is higher than last year, even in spite of onetime outlays related to the spin-off. This put cash flow well on pace towards our full year guidance for Kellogg Company. So as you step back, you see that our growth in net sales and operating profit were on algorithm or better in the quarter and year-to-date period, and EPS would have been as well were it not for the macro-related pressures on our non-operating items. And we were well on pace to achieve the full year guidance we had given for the Kellogg Company. Now, let's take a look at each metric in closer detail, starting with our net sales growth on slide number 13. As expected, price elasticities rose around the world, putting pressure on volume, though this volume did come in modestly better than projected. Price/mix moderated sequentially from recent quarters as we began to lap some of our largest revenue growth management actions last year. The divestiture of our Russia business, which occurred in July, clipped about 1 percentage point from our overall net sales growth in quarter three and will do so again in quarter four. Foreign currency translation once again was a headwind of about negative 3 percentage points. And based on where rates are today, we are probably facing a similar headwind in quarter four. Most of this is related to the devaluation of the Nigerian naira, partially offset by strength in the euro, pound sterling and Mexican peso. We estimate that portions of the business that represent Kellanova generated better organic growth than total Kellogg Company in the third quarter. So even with the long anticipated rise in elasticities and the lapping of last year's pricing actions, our organic net sales growth remains within our long-term target range. Now, let's discuss gross profit, starting with slide number 14. As we've stated many times, our focus during the period of heightened input cost inflation and supply bottlenecks and shortages was on growing gross profit dollars. And as you can see, we have done just that every quarter this year. And as you can see on slide number 15, we have also made good progress in restoring our gross profit margin as well. We're still not back to our 2019 pre-pandemic levels, but this restoration of margins is proceeding faster than expected with year-on-year expansion in each quarter so far this year. This progress also applies to the Kellanova business, which gets an immediate lift from the absence of North America cereal, and should continue to benefit from the same drivers going forward price realization catching up to input cost inflation, improving supply chain conditions, and the ongoing combination of productivity, revenue growth management and mix shift towards our most differentiated brands. Slide number 16 shows how our sustained top line growth and margin expansion resulted in another quarter of double-digit growth in operating profit. Keep in mind that, this growth includes the divestiture of Russia, and it also includes a double-digit increase in brand building on a currency-neutral basis. Slide number 17 indicates that we are not only restoring our margins at the gross profit level, but at the operating profit level as well. We have delivered year-on-year expansion in operating margin in each quarter of this year, putting our year-to-date margin a full 100 basis points ahead of last year and ahead of our own projections as Kellanova will start immediately with a modestly higher operating margin just from the absence of North America cereal. And we expect to continue to improve our margin going forward as we discussed at our Day@K Investor event. This, along with top line growth propelled by our strong brands and growth-oriented categories and markets, give us confidence in sustaining profit growth. Moving down the income statement. Slide number 18 shows that our adjusted basis earnings per share growth in quarter three was once again mostly attributable to operating profit, which has grown enough to more than offset what are severe macro-related headwinds within our below-the-line items. Those below-the-line pressures were expected and will continue through the year. Interest expense increased significantly year-on-year in the quarter and the year-to-date period due to higher interest rates. Other income decreased sharply year-on-year in each of the first three quarters this year, reflecting the accounting of pension and post-retirement plan asset values stemming from last year's decline in the financial markets and the rising interest rates. Our effective tax rate in quarter three was up year-on-year, keeping our year-to-date rate at the 22% we've been expecting for the full year. Average shares outstanding were again up slightly year-on-year in quarter three, and we would expect that to be the case for the full year as well. Foreign currency translation was positive to earnings per share in quarter three as strength in European and Mexican currencies more than offset what is a relatively small impact from Nigerian Naira at the EPS level. Turning to slide number 19. We see that our free cash flow year-to-date is ahead of the prior year, even in spite of one-time cash outlays related to the spin-off and despite lapping a year ago period in which our capital expenditure was delayed because of supply disruptions. We are pleased with our cash flow conversion, which is higher than last year despite deal factors. This year-to-date free cash flow performance put us well on our way to achieving the full year guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion that we had communicated for the Kellogg Company. Meanwhile, we continue to reduce our debt leverage year-on-year, further enhancing our financial flexibility. The slide shows how our net debt continued to decrease even as we continue to deliver higher operating profit and therefore EBITDA. This was our net debt at the end of quarter prior to the spin-off. Upon the spin-off, the transfer of net debt to W.K. Kellogg Company was executed and is estimated to be approximately $600 million. Now, let's discuss our outlook at Kellanova now that W.K. Kellogg Company, our North America cereal business, is no longer in our portfolio. Work is underway to prepare Kellanova financials for all four quarters of 2022 and the first three quarters of 2023, treating W.K. KC as a discontinued operation. We will have those completed a few months from now, and we plan to share them with you at our next quarterly earnings release in early February. In the meantime, slide number 20 offers estimates in absolute dollars for the fourth quarter, our initial quarter at Kellanova. Kellanova was projected to deliver net sales of approximately $3.1 billion in the quarter. Excluding W.K. KC from the base and excluding about 1% negative impact of the Russia divestiture and foreign currency translation that at current rates would be similar to the negative impact we saw on net sales in quarter three, we believe organic net sales growth will be within our long-term growth target even as we assume continued elasticity impact and the lapping of the year-on-year price increases. We expect the restoration of gross profit margin to continue, increasing year-on-year and reaching a level in quarter four of just over 33%. We project adjusted basis operating profit of approximately $380 million to $390 million, which we estimate will translate into year-on-year growth that is within our long-term growth target. Excluding W.K. KC from the base and excluding the small impacts of this year's Russia divestiture and currency translation. We project adjusted basis earnings per share of approximately $0.73 to $0.76 after accounting for interest expense of around $85 million and other income of around $25 million, both of which will continue to reflect the year-on-year headwinds we've experienced all year. In short, we expect Kellanova's quarter four 2023 to remain within our long-term algorithm for net sales and operating profit growth. Looking to 2024. As indicated at our Day at K investor event a few months ago, we expect to sustain on-algorithm growth on sales and profit. We are still in our budgeting process, and we will provide those details at our normal time in February. Allow me to summarize on slide number 21. We feel very good about our financial performance and conditions heading into quarter four as the new Kellanova. Our top line growth remains ahead of our long-term target. Our profit margins continue to recover more quickly than we had anticipated. Our balance sheet is solid as is our free cash flow even as we executed a transformational spin-off. Let me now turn it back to Steve for a run-through of our businesses around the world. Hi, Jason. I think, Jason, we will update the details when we get to our normal cycle in February once we've had this year's actual latest foreign exchange rates. So I think we'll update the absolutes as we kind of get to February. We're right in the middle of our budgeting process right now. But as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we fully expect to be on our algorithm growth rates we had shared in August. No, we are on track, I mean, from a 2023 standpoint, right? We are ahead of pace in the first nine months. And like I mentioned, we are on track from a 2023 standpoint. So we'll share the specific details when we get to February. From an underlying business performance, right, we are right on track with -- on 2023. Yes. I think similar trends to what we are seeing right now from a quarter four standpoint, if you exclude WKKC from the base, the Russia divestiture would be about a 1% negative impact and then currency translation around 3%. So, I think if you kind of exclude those 3%, you get to the -- you get to our algo growth of somewhere between 3% to 5% for the overall business. We would expect international to grow faster than the US in the next quarter. We continue to expect price elasticities. That's always been in our guidance, so we expect that to continue. We'd expect volume to be down, but for the decline to moderate in quarter 4 as we get back to full merchandising, particularly in the US. So that's kind of the shape of what we're expecting in quarter 4. Yeah. Like I said, we're working through our budgeting process right now. I think we'd expect a gradual return to volume growth in 2024. Obviously, as you start lapping some of the price increases and some of the volume in quarter three, the laps get easier. But that's probably the shape of how we're looking at 2024 right now. Yes. So I think in terms of gross margin, I think you hit on the two biggest items, right? So it is pricing, catching our presentation, and it is a much better performing supply chain. So those two are the biggest drivers of the gross margin improvement and it's been coming in better than what we had expected and faster than what we had expected. So more of a timing in terms of the catch-up happening faster than what we have planned for. So -- and I think in terms of -- the parallel costs, we did incur some parallel costs in quarter three for -- as we kind of ran value operations. I think that's now behind us post-spin. I wouldn't say, it's a significant lap item for next year. So we did incur costs, but they weren't really significant from a lap standpoint. Yes. So I think, Bryan, we'll give you the details when we close out 2023, right? I think from a growth rate standpoint, like I said, we fully expect to be on long-term growth algorithm for 2024. I think as you'd appreciate, right, currencies will be different when we close out 2023 versus the assumptions that we had made in August. Like I had mentioned on 2023, we are -- at the end of nine months, we are ahead of pace versus the guidance that we had given. And so where we close out from a 2023 standpoint. So I think those kind of pace and currency adjustments would cause the absolute to differ, but we were right in the middle of that work as part of our budget. And I fully expect our long-term growth rates to be on algorithm. Yes. So it's currency-neutral, right? The overall rates that we had given for the company included a view of currency, right? So that's for the total Kellogg Company, the ones that we had given in our preliminary 2024 guidance. Where there are currency-neutral numbers, those won't be impacted by those view of the long-term rates. But the rates number base change, right, depending on where we end up on 2023. Yes. We talked that as we kind of complete the budgeting process, Bryan. I think it's a bit premature for me to comment on that. But yes, margin recovery is recovering faster. You'll see that in our results. And we'll give you the specifics on 2024 when we get to it. Good morning, Alexia. Yes. So firstly, I think, we like the organic opportunity that's in front of us. And I think despite the short-term volume discussion, right, I think the growth potential of our portfolio is strong. We've got plenty of organic growth opportunities. I think from a capital allocation standpoint, prioritizing investments into the organic opportunity, particularly in capacity expansion in Pringles in emerging markets, is kind of the immediate priority. We'd always evaluate M&A opportunities, I think largely in the areas of snacking and emerging markets. So if something -- we run a very disciplined process, and so we continue to evaluate opportunities come. Yes. So I think the easiest way to think about it is there's a lag between the devaluation that happens on an operating transaction basis and when the official rate moved. But we've been seeing the devaluation of the naira on the ground from an operating basis all the way through 2022, first half of 2023 and have been taking pricing to cover that. And I think the business has done a remarkable job taking multiple rounds of price. And the great news, and it's a testament just to the strength of our brand and our route to market, that despite the pricing that we've taken, volumes have held up and our shares have held up. So that's been happening. And like you said, we've been seeing that come through with elevated growth rates through 2022 into the first half of 2023. Then you have the devaluation that happened in the last quarter. And so the transaction and the translation have gotten more in sync as a result of that. And so that's why now you're seeing a bit of a lag. I mean the business continues to be growing at double-digit rates and we continue to take pricing, but there is a lag that's kind of flowing in, in the way it's go through in the P&L. But I think from an overall standpoint, a strong route to market, taking the pricing to cover our margins through this whole cycle, we protected our margins. And that's been the focus of the team, and we've done that volumes of hand. Well, EPS has been -- it's been a help to EPS. That's the reference there was from a top line standpoint, about a 3% drag the top line growth. EPS was actually positive in the -- in quarter three, right? And so -- yes. But I think from a top line standpoint, about a 3% hit to the top line. And from an EPS, I'd say, using the exchange that we have, probably flattish. So much more impact on the top line than the EPS."

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session with publishing analysts. At this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for Kellogg Company. Mr. Renwick, you may begin your conference call.\nJohn Renwick: Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for a review of our second quarter results and an update on our outlook for 2023. I am joined this morning by: Steve Cahillane, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Amit Banati, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. Slide number 3 shows our forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware, certain statements made today, such as projections for Kellogg Company\u2019s future performance, are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the third slide of this presentation, as well as to our public SEC filings. A recording of today\u2019s webcast and supporting documents will be archived for at least 90 days on the Investor page of KelloggCompany.com. As always, when referring to our results and outlook, unless otherwise noted, we will be referring to them on an organic basis for net sales and on a currency-neutral adjusted basis for operating profit and earnings per share. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Cahillane: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another better than expected quarter featuring two key elements depicted on slide number 5. Not only did we sustain top line growth that remained better than our long-term targets, but we did so across our portfolio and geographies with growth in all major category groups in each of our four regions. And we did so even as we lapped the prior year's retail inventory replenishment and particularly strong in-market performance. We also continued to experience a sooner-than sooner than expected recovery in our gross profit margin. Much of this is related to bottlenecks and shortages diminishing. This recovery is ahead of schedule and it was a principal driver behind our better than expected profit and earnings this quarter. Also encouraging is the momentum, we've continued to see in our biggest, most differentiated brands shown on slide number 6. These advantage brands made up half of our net sales in 2022 and they continue to outpace our overall growth creating both top-line momentum and a favorable margin mix. So when we put it all together the earlier than expected margin recovery and the sustained top-line growth across our portfolio, you can see why we feel comfortable raising our full year sales profit and earnings guidance again. We also remain very active on our social and environmental program Kellogg's Better Days Promise. Slide number 7 shows just a few examples of actions we took during the quarter, including donations and volunteering in the area of hunger and tie-ins to important commercial programs with customers. The slide also shows another wave of recognitions that we have received, simply confirming what we already know, that doing what is right is in our DNA. In the center of the slide, you can see that we have published an update regarding our progress toward our Better Days targets. On social goals like addressing hunger or environmental goals like reducing our admissions or in diversity goals like gender representation and management, we remain ahead of pace on our Better Days goals. And of course, we remain very busy in getting ready for our pending separation. Indeed on slide number eight most of what you see under the Q1, Q2 and the Q2, Q3 phases are now complete. The team has done an exceptional job of digging into every detail, every brand, every process, every role to make sure we have left no stone unturned in our quest to create two successful value-creating companies. And as you look to the Q3 phase, you can see a few milestones that are very much upon us. On July 24th WK Kellogg Co.'s Form-10 was filed publicly providing you with important information about management, strategy, capital structure, and carve out financials. On July 30th, just this past Sunday, we began to run WK Kellogg Co. and Kelanova in parallel. By running the water through the pipes, so to speak, we can identify and address any process gaps and other opportunities well before the separation takes place. Employees in new roles can transition properly. Services under the transition services agreement can be ironed out more completely. And while this requires incremental expenses, they are already incorporated into our guidance. And then less than a week from today on August 9th, we will host our Day at K investor event at which leaders of both WK Kellogg Co. and Kellenova will present to the strategies, the capital structures, and the financial outlooks for both companies. And we still expect the separation transaction to take place during the fourth quarter. Because we can't know the exact timing of the various customary approvals, we can't be more specific than that quite yet. But we have every confidence that it is on track. In sum, the second quarter was another very good quarter in terms of financial results, sustainability actions, and progress toward our spinoff. And now let me turn it over to Amit to take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail.\nAmit Banati: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide number 10 provides a summary of our second quarter and first half results. Net sales growth in quarter two was 7% on an organic basis. Importantly, this growth remained broad-based across category groups and regions, and paces us a little ahead of our previous full-year outlook. Operating profit grew 14% on an adjusted basis. This growth came on top of last year's 10% currency neutral growth, and it featured the sooner than expected recovery in gross profit margin that Steve discussed. This operating profit performance puts us a little ahead of our previous full year outlook. Earnings per share grew 5% on an adjusted basis, sustaining mid-single-digit growth in spite of macro-related headwinds versus last year on below-the-line items such as interest expense and pension income. Cash flow through the first half is down year-on-year because of outlays related to the pending spin-off but on track for the full year. Let's now discuss each of these in more detail. Slide number 11 splits our year-on-year net sales growth into its components. Price mix growth was sustained in the mid-teens with growth in both developed markets and emerging markets. As expected, price elasticities continued to move higher around the world, and this weighed down our volume. Also contributing to our volume decline was lapping last year's replenishment of trade inventories, particularly as we recovered from the serial strike. Foreign currency translation continued to negatively impact net sales growth by nearly 3% year-on-year in the quarter. If today's exchange rates versus the US dollar were to hold, we would expect to see a similar impact in the second half, as the favorable impact of lapping last year's dollar strengthening is offset by the recent devaluation of the Nigerian naira. So our top line growth in quarter two supports our long-standing planning assumptions for elasticities to rise and for revenue growth management actions to begin to anniversary. Next, let's discuss gross profit shown on slide number 12. As we've discussed numerous times, our objective in this high inflation environment has been to protect gross profit dollars via productivity savings and revenue growth management. In quarter two, our adjusted gross profit increased by 9% year-on-year. On top of a year ago quarter that itself was up more than 6% on a currency-neutral basis. From a margin perspective, recall that our expectation was for a gradual improvement as the year progresses. But as Steve mentioned, we are ahead of pace in this recovery with year-on-year expansion coming sooner than expected. Much of this is driven by bottlenecks and shortages receding, which eliminates many of the inefficiencies and incremental costs experienced over the past year or more. In addition, productivity and revenue growth management continue to catch up to a high market-driven input cost inflation. So while we have a ways to go before we get back to pre-pandemic levels, this performance gives us increased confidence in our ability to recover margins. For 2023, there is no change to our outlook for expansion in the second half, but Q2's better-than-expected performance moves up our full year outlook for gross margin to be somewhere around 50 basis points of expansion year-on-year. Operating profit, as shown on slide number 13, grew 14% year-on-year in quarter two, even as it laps a robust 10% gain in the year earlier quarter, and even with advertising and promotion investment increasing year-on-year. Through the first half, our operating profit was up 16% year-on-year. Our second half comparisons get a little tougher, and we have begun to run W.K. Kellogg Company in parallel requiring incremental expenses year-on-year that are already baked into our guidance. That, we are ahead of pace, and this gives us the confidence to raise our full year operating profit guidance. Moving down the income statement. Slide number 14 shows that our earnings per share growth has been attributable to operating profit, which has grown enough to more than offset what are severe macro-related headwinds in within our below-the-line items. These below-the-line pressures were expected and will continue through the year. Interest expense increased significantly year-on-year due to higher interest rates. In the second half, we expect to see modestly lower interest expense than we recorded in the first half, owing to the timing of cash flow. Other income decreased sharply year-on-year in each of the first two quarters this year. reflecting the accounting of pension and postretirement plan asset values and interest rates stemming from last year's declines in financial markets. Owing to favorability in some other items in the slide, Q2 came in higher than both Q1 and the run rate we would expect for the remaining quarters. Our effective tax rate in quarter two was back to the kind of 22% rate we would expect for the full year after being a bit above that in quarter one. Average shares outstanding were up slightly year-on-year in both quarter one and quarter two. And we would expect that to be the case for the full year as well. Foreign currency translation turned slightly positive to EPS in quarter two, finishing the half with about a negative 1% impact. We leave foreign currency translation out of our guidance because it is out of our control and difficult to predict. But if we took today's exchange rates, including a substantially devalued Nigerian Naira partially offset by the lapping of other currencies a year ago weakening, we would estimate a similar impact for the full year as that of the first half. A key message here is that these below the line items are collectively weighing down EPS as expected, but it is important to remember that the operational side of our P&L through operating profit remains very strong. Turning to slide number 15, we see that cash flow is below last year's high level. This is due to three factors. First, one-time cash outlays related to the spin-off amounting to roughly $130 million. Secondly, lapping unusually strong inflows in the year-ago period, including some related to derivatives. And thirdly, timing of capital expenditure, which last year was much more weighted to the second half due to supply disruptions earlier that year. So while it is down from a high level last year, we believe cash flow is right on track to achieve our full year guidance. Meanwhile, we continue to reduce our debt leverage year-on-year, further enhancing our financial flexibility. All in, our second quarter performance puts us slightly ahead of pace for the full year. Accordingly, we are once again moving up our full year guidance as shown on slide number 16. We are raising our guidance for organic net sales growth to approximately 7%, which is the high end of our previous guidance range. Our quarter two performance was consistent with our assumption of decelerating growth as the year progresses, which reflects a likely return of elasticity towards historical levels as well as lapping of particularly substantial revenue growth management actions in the second half of last year. This 7% organic growth is well above our long-term target. We are raising our guidance for adjusted operating profit growth to 9%-10% on a currency-neutral basis, which is the upper half of our previous guidance range. This raise reflects a stronger-than-expected Q2 performance, particularly our earlier recovery in gross profit margin, and yet still accounts for some investment shifts into the second half as well as incremental costs in the second half for operating WK Kellogg Company in parallel as a company within a company. We expect to improve margins this year which combined with our above target net sales growth will deliver operating profit growth that is also above our long-term target. Based on the improved operating profit outlook, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance as well, now looking for a year-on-year decline of 1% to 2%, the upper portion of our previous guidance range. Remember that all and more of this decline is explained by the year-on-year reduction in pension and post-retirement income, a non-operating, non-cash item that is expected to have a negative impact of nearly 7% on EPS this year. The negative impact of higher interest expense due to higher interest rates in the economy is another negative impact of more than 4%. If it weren't for these two macro-related impacts, our guidance for EPS growth would also be well above a long-term growth rate. Our guidance for cash flow remains at $1 to $1.1 billion. Recall that, within this guidance, we are expecting a year-on-year increase in our underlying cash flow offset by one-time cash costs and capital related to the spin-off. A couple of elements to keep in mind regarding this guidance. First, while we expect the spin-off to be transacted during quarter four our guidance assumes it takes place at year-end purely for simplicity reasons. And secondly, the impact of our recently completed divestiture of our Russian business does not have a material impact on our guidance. So to summarize our financial position on slide number 17, quarter two was yet another quarter of over-delivery and we have plans in place to sustain our earnings momentum. Accordingly, we are again raising our full year guidance for 2023. Our profit margins have expanded sooner than anticipated and this should continue, particularly as our service levels return to normal. Our net sales growth remains strong and while we are keeping our assumption of rising elasticity in the second half, along with lapping sizable revenue growth management actions, we are confident enough in our top-line growth to raise our full-year outlook. Our financial flexibility is strong, marked by a solid balance sheet and cash flow that remains in good shape, even with some adverse timing in the first half. We continue to make good progress on setting up both Kellanova and WK Kellogg for operational and financial success, and we are looking forward to sharing with you the two companies' exciting strategies, capital structures, and financial outlooks next week. And with that, I'll turn it back to Steve to walk you through our individual businesses.\nSteve Cahillane: Thanks, Amit. With the spin-off approaching, we'll once again organize our discussion around the businesses that will comprise Kellenova and WK Kellogg. Slide number 19 reminds you of the composition of the two businesses, and on the slide you can see how both remain in good form with good top-line growth. Let's start by discussing the Kelinova businesses leading off with our emerging markets regions. Slide number 20 shows the financial performance of our EMEA region. This region sustained its outstanding underlying momentum in the second quarter, posting mid-teens organic net sales growth on top of extremely strong comparisons. It again expanded its operating profit margin year-on-year in the second quarter, and it again posted exceptional 19% operating profit growth. And this performance came in spite of exceedingly high cost inflation and reinvestment into the business. Drilling down into its key category groups, we see on slide number 21 that EMEA's snacks sustained double-digit organic net sales growth in quarter two, with this growth coming on top of exceptional growth in the year-ago quarter. In market, snacks category growth rates remained elevated and have even accelerated slightly from the previous quarter. Pringles this year has outpaced the salty snacks category that is growing in the high-teens or better across key markets and during the second quarter we continued to gain share in markets like Australia, Japan, Korea and Thailand. EMEA cereal is also sustaining strong growth momentum as shown on slide number 22. This business delivered growth on top of last year's strong growth with particular strength in Australia, Africa, and the Middle East, North Africa, Turkey sub-region. And in market, we've outpaced a category this year that has grown in the mid single digits collectively across key markets which brings us to noodles and other and slide number 23. Led by Multipro in Nigeria, this business continued to deliver organic net sales growth in excess of 20% in the second quarter. Multipro continues to execute extremely well, widening its competitive moat and staying on an impressive growth trajectory in an always exciting market. Meanwhile, we continue to expand our Kellogg's noodles business outside of Nigeria. In the second quarter, net sales of Kellogg's noodles grew significantly year-on-year in both South Africa and Egypt. As you know the Nigerian Naira has been officially devalued recently but our team has been proactively managing through de facto currency devaluation for some time in order to protect our margins. Much of this proactive pricing which has contributed to the 20% plus growth you see on the slide is behind us now. This reflects the experience and savvy of our local team and the strength of this business. And we expect continued, if moderated top line growth going forward. Clearly, EMEA is a growth engine for Kellogg Company and soon, Kellanova. And it is performing extremely well so far in 2023. For the full year, we continue to expect sustained momentum across all three category groups, delivering yet another year of organic net sales growth, and while improving our profit margins. Let's turn to our other emerging markets region, Latin America, starting on slide number 25. Kellogg Latin America, in the second quarter delivered another quarter of strong organic net sales growth on top of equally strong growth last year. This growth was led by our two largest markets, Mexico and Brazil. We again expanded our operating margin in the second quarter leading to another quarter of operating profit growth of 20% year-on-year. As shown on slide number 26, our snacks business in Latin America was up against an unusually high comparison in the second quarter, but its organic net sales growth was a solid 6% year-on-year through the first half. In market, we saw sustained double-digit growth for the salty snacks category in Mexico and Brazil, and Pringles has gained share in both of these key markets. We also outpaced a very strong portable wholesome snacks category in Mexico and stabilized our share in cookies in Brazil. On slide number 27 you can see that Kellogg Latin America again recorded double-digit organic net sales growth in cereal. This growth was broad-based with good growth across each of our sub regions. In market cereal category growth rates remain robust in the region and in the second quarter we kept pace in Mexico and we gained share in Brazil and Puerto Rico. So Latin America continues to perform well and remains right on track. For the full year, we continue to expect this region to sustain strong top-line momentum with growth in both snacks and cereal and continued recovery in its profit margins, all while working on separating its Caribbean cereal business as part of the spinoff. Once again, we can see that both of our emerging markets regions are showing current momentum to go with their outstanding long-term prospects. Now let's turn to our developed markets, starting with Kellogg Europe and slide number 29. The region posted sustained top-line growth, accelerating to 11% organic growth in the second quarter. Operating profit declined once again due to Russia, which we divested just after the end of the quarter. Excluding Russia, Kellogg Europe's operating profit increased in the mid-single digits in spite of extremely high cost pressures. So our underlying European business is performing very well. On slide number 30, you can see that snacks which represent just over half of our sales in Kellogg Europe continue to lead our growth in this region. In fact quarter two marked the eighth quarter in the last ten in which we have posted double-digit growth in our European snacks business. This was growth on top of strong year-ago growth and it was driven by both volume and price mix. The growth was also broad-based with double-digit gains in all sub-regions except for suspended shipments into Russia. In market the salty snacks category remains in strong double-digit growth across key markets with Pringles gaining share in key markets like Italy and France and sustaining strong consumption growth in spite of lapping notably robust year ago performance in markets like the UK, Germany and Spain. And in portable wholesome snacks, we are experiencing double-digit consumption growth overall in the region paced by a two-point share gain in the UK led by Rice Krispies Squares. Our cereal business in Europe, shown on Slide number 31, also sustained growth in the second quarter. Growth has slowed as we've discussed previously, owing to category elasticities rising, but we continue to execute well in a challenging market. So it was another good quarter for Kellogg Europe, keeping us right on track for another good year. For the full year, we continue to expect the region to post yet another year of solid top line growth, led by Snacks. We'll continue to navigate through cost pressures, which were particularly heavy in the first half, and we have a plan to gradually improve margins during the second half. And as we mentioned, we have closed on our divestiture of our Russia business. We'll now turn to Kellogg North America and Slide number 33. As anticipated, net sales growth decelerated in the second quarter as elasticity continued to move higher and as we lapped last year's sizable replenishment of trade inventories. However, mid-teens price mix growth was sustained and we delivered solid organic growth in net sales. Importantly, we continue to recover gross profit margin, reflecting productivity, revenue growth management and diminishing bottlenecks and shortages. This enabled us to increase investments in our brands and still deliver 14% operating profit growth year-on-year. This region again generated organic net sales growth in all three category groups in the second quarter. Slide number 34 shows snacks, which represents over half of our North American net sales. In the second quarter, it grew net sales by 5% on top of a notably strong year earlier quarter, which had included retailer inventory replenishment. We also grew in frozen foods, shown on Slide number 35. In market, Eggo's consumption growth improved in the second quarter, continuing to moderate its share losses as our supply has improved. And Morningstar Farms gained share in the quarter as its supply is improving as well. All of the regions and categories we have discussed up to now will be part of Kellanova, and all of them are showing continued net sales growth to go with progress towards recovering margins. Now let's turn to our North America cereal business which forms the vast majority of what will soon be W.K. Kellogg Co. As shown on Slide number 36, this business continues to recover, growing its net sales in the second quarter despite lapping substantial retailer inventory replenishment last year. In the US the category remained in high single-digit growth in spite of gradually rising elasticities. Led by brands like Corn Flakes, Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies and Raisin brand, we continue to gain share year-on-year and we continue to activate more commercial support, increase our distribution and increase our velocities. A similar recovery is happening in Canada, where we also continued to gain share in the second quarter. So this business is back on solid footing with more to come. Turning to Slide number 37. Our North America region had a very strong first half, giving us confidence in our full year expectations. Snacks should remain solidly in growth while Frozen is expected to continue to show improved performance, and our North America cereal business continues its recovery. We are off to an earlier-than-expected start to margin recovery in this region even as we reinvest more in our brands. So North America is in good shape as we set up for the spin-off of W.K. Kellogg Co. later this year. So let me summarize on Slide number 39. We continue to put up better-than-expected results. Our first half featured top line growth across our regions and across our categories with notable momentum in snacks around the world and our businesses in emerging markets. It also featured an earlier-than-expected recovery in profit margins, which enables us to reinvest in the business and sustain strong earnings and cash flow growth. Thanks to the passion and skill of our organization, we have not allowed the spin-off work to prevent us from delivering and even overdelivering on our plans. In fact, we're halfway through the year, and we've already raised our full year outlook twice. And the work we are doing for the spin-off will pay off. We are separating this great company into two, even better companies, one with enhanced focus and the fit-for-purpose strategy and resourcing it deserves and the other with a portfolio-oriented solidly towards growth. And we'll share with you our plans for both companies at our Day 8-K investor event next week. And with that, we'll open up the line for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session with publishing analysts. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Lazar: Thanks so much. Good morning, everybody. Steve, some food companies, as you've noticed this quarter -- some food companies this quarter have started to discuss maybe some recent shifts at least in what they're seeing in consumer behavior, in promotional activity and sort of elasticity in the US, some of which is to be expected as supply constraints are eased, of course. I was hoping you could talk a bit about any more recent shifts that you are seeing in your business, if any? And if they are outside of sort of what your expectations might have been even a quarter ago? Thank you.\nA \u2013 Steve Cahillane: Yes. Thanks for the question, Andrew. I'd say a couple of things. The consumer behavior is pretty much in line with our expectations. And I know probably underlying your question is also some volume questions around what's happening in North America, which was also in line with our expectations. You have to remember, obviously, we've taken such significant pricing over the last several years and elasticities have been almost nonexistent. So we've been forecasting their return for quite some time. And so in line with our expectations, we're also lapping inventory replenishment from last year. So it's pretty much where we expected it to be. In terms of consumer behavior, I'd say the shift that we're starting to see is consumers are really maximizing their pantries. They're closely managing their household inventories, their pantry inventories, zealously guarding against waste, as you would expect in this environment. And so we haven't seen shifts out of our category really. We haven't seen meaningful moves in private label or anything like that. I would just say a consumer that's ever more conscious of the strains on their household budgets, and we would expect that to continue moving forward. And as we look at our promotional activities for the balance of the year, we're also taking that into account. And we're pleased our service levels are going back up and allowing us to be a little bit more front-footed as we think about display execution, quality, merchandising and things of that nature.\nQ \u2013 Andrew Lazar: Got it. Thanks so much and see you next week. \nA \u2013 Steve Cahillane: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Cody Ross of UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nCody Ross: Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking our questions.\nA \u2013 Steve Cahillane: Good morning, Cody.\nCody Ross: I just want to talk a little bit about the volume growth. Hey, good morning. I just want to talk about your volume performance in the quarter as that's what investors are really primarily focusing on these days. Your volume in developed markets, particularly the US came in below what we expected. How are you thinking about volume growth moving forward into the back half and into next year? And how much visibility do you have to return to volume growth? And what would those levers be to drive it? And then I have a follow-up.\nSteven Cahillane: Yeah. Thanks, Cody. As I mentioned, volumes were in line with our expectations. It doesn't mean we're pleased about it, but take the level of pricing that we've taken, you have to see elasticity\u2019s moving higher, which is exactly what we've seen. Our quarter two was amplified by lapping the year ago trade inventory replenishment in North America. There's no question about that. In Latin America, more than a third of our volume decline in the second quarter came from price pack architecture and calling of lower-margin SKUs, which was very much planned. So we've been planning on these elasticities returning and they have returned. I would say, on a go-forward basis, we're more optimistic and more constructive about our volumes. So I don't see \u2013 I don\u2019t see this volume continuing this level. I see sequential improvement, and we do see, as we'll talk about next week in great detail exactly what that looks like as we return to a more balanced equation of volume versus price, but there's no question, this has been an unprecedented time in this industry with the type of pricing that's been necessary to take because of the input cost inflation. But we've got lots of dry powder as we think about the second half of the year to drive real quality merchandising. I'm talking about display execution, brand building with significant advertising spend, really creating those connections with our consumers. So, in line with expectations, admittedly a high volume decline, but nothing that surprised us going forward. And maybe Amit can build on that.\nAmit Banati: Yeah. So just a couple of further builds, right? I think the one thing I'd point out is in quarter two, the inventory lap was the most pronounced. So I think that was most pronounced in this quarter. And so I think going forward, that will be lesser of an impact. I think from a rest of the year, we continue to focus decelerating sales growth. That's what's been implied. That's what's implied in our guidance. And it's a couple of things that's driving that. One is, we obviously start lapping last year's substantial revenue growth management actions, which were that much higher in the second half. And we continue to prudently assume higher elasticities for the rest of the year.\nCody Ross: Great. Thank you and I just want to follow up on that question, and you may have alluded to it already in your answer to my last question. But you ship below consumption or at least Nielsen consumption in North America this quarter. What drove that? Was that all lapping the serial over shipment last year of replenishment, I should say? And are you seeing any de-stocking from retailers as they try to manage their working capital. And then I'll pass it on.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes, I'd say a good bit due to the replenishment and we're potentially seeing some retailer de-stocking. It's really hard to pin down when you're talking about a quarter. And we see that as a good thing, Cody. Obviously, service levels for the last year plus have been below normal levels, which required safety stock across the supply chain. As we get to service levels back above 95%, you'd see a renewed confidence, a growing confidence at retail and therefore, not needing to carry the same days of supply. And again, we don't see that as a negative. And we see, as we said, from a go-forward perspective, lots of confidence in our plans, which has led to us raising our guidance for the top line slightly.\nCody Ross: Thank you. Looking forward to next week.\nSteve Cahillane: See you next week.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the David Palmer of Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Good morning. I think you said gross margins should be up 50 basis points year-over-year for the full year. I think I heard that right. If that's right, that implies something like a 30-plus basis point gross margin decline in the second half. What are some of the puts and takes we should be thinking about for gross margin and maybe a change in trend? And I have a quick follow-up.\nAmit Banati: Yeah. So I wouldn't say there's a change in trend. I think we had always said gross margin would be up during the year. I think based on -- it's coming in faster than we expected, predominantly driven by bottlenecks and shortages receding faster than what we had thought. So I think the supply chain is performing really well. Are we seeing that in cost, we're seeing that in service levels. We'd expect that trend to continue. And I think when you kind of put it all together, our forecast right now is that we should be up about 50 basis points for the year.\nDavid Palmer: And then I know from your filing, North America cereal adjusted gross margin was about 26% in the first quarter. I don't know, if it's too early for you to have that for the second quarter. But I'm just wondering, I know obviously, we'll be talking more next week, but how are you thinking about gross margin potential for that business? I would have thought a large-scale cereal business like yours, would be just naturally living at a much higher gross margin level. Just any thoughts? And of course, we'll see you next week. Thank you.\nAmit Banati: Yeah. So I think we continue to recover both share and margin as that business recovers from the fire in strike through the cycle of replenishing inventory and full commercial execution. So that recovery is well underway, both from our top line share as well as a margin standpoint. And I think the go forward, we'll obviously discuss fully next week.\nSteve Cahillane: Stay tuned for an exciting event next week, David.\nDavid Palmer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley. The line is now open. Please go ahead.\nPamela Kaufman: Hi. Good morning. I was on mute. Can you discuss how much investments shifted into the second half of the year? I think you mentioned that in the prepared remarks. And just broadly how you're thinking about marketing and brand investment relative to your original plan given what you're seeing from a demand standpoint and increasing elasticities?\nSteve Cahillane: Yeah, Pam, maybe I'll start and then flip it to Amit. I'd say we have clearly increased our investment in A&P in the first half of the year as we said we would. We were maybe a little bit more judicious as we continue to work through bottlenecks and shortages and get our confidence in our supply chain back to where it needs to be to really drive the type of quality merchandising that we want to drive. And so we see more ambitious plans in the second half. So we'll see an increase above the run rate that we had in the first half as we drive really good program against Pringles and Cheez-It, our cereal business and so forth. So, continued investment in the brands in a constructive way to drive good quality displays, and promotions on the floor into the second half. And so that's what you see happening. A little bit of dynamism going forward, but a confidence in our supply chain is a lot more solid than I'd say it's been really since the pandemic. I don't know, Amit, if you want to?\nAmit Banati: No. I think there's been some shift. We always talk this year that we'd be lapping last year's pull down, right, as we went -- as we were building inventories in the first half of 2022. So, for the half, we were up mid-single digits on for the half in A&P. And so -- the quarter and so I think we'd expect some shifting of that into the second half.\nPamela Kaufman: Great. Thank you. And just wanted to ask what you're seeing -- what you're observing from the consumer outside of the US your results, especially in Europe were very strong. So, maybe if you could touch on what you're seeing in terms of consumer behavior across your geographies?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. I'd say -- and we've talked about this in the past, Europe is probably under more strain in terms of household budgets than North America. But we performed very well in the second quarter, obviously, you saw our snacks grow nearly 20% on an organic basis. You saw positive growth in cereal. And so from that perspective, our brands are performing well. Our relationships with our customers are very, very constructive. We find the overlap of what they need for their consumers, which we share as we think about putting together promotions and programs that address a strained household budget environment in Europe. But I'd say the brands have performed very well. Our customer teams have performed in an excellent manner as we've executed unprecedented revenue growth management activities in Europe, and really continue to operate in a situation where household budgets remain under pressure. And for the foreseeable future, I think we'll continue to remain under pressure. But underlying that is a resilient consumer who continues to spend against discretionary items like Pringles and like our cereal brands.\nPamela Kaufman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open, please go ahead.\nSteve Powers: Yes. Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I guess I just want to go back to -- I think it was David Palmer's question on the second half gross margin I didn't -- maybe it is me, I just didn't quite follow the answer. I do think the math suggests essentially no gross margin expansion in the back half, but you sound confident about the momentum you've got going into the back half. So, I just wanted to revisit that, if I could. And then a different topic entirely, but just on Nigeria, it sounded like from the way you described it that you didn't anticipate taking any incremental pricing from here post-devaluation that you've kind of been proactive on. I just wanted to play that back and talk through what the dynamics are and just kind of validate whether -- what the pricing outlook is in the context of devaluation going forward?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes, I'll start with the Africa topline and then turn it to Amit to build on that and then address your gross margin question. I'd say the African team has really shown their skill, their savvy, their experience because we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've seen the devaluation of the de facto basis and have been transacting pretty much at the rate that it was the value to or close to it. And so that's why you see the level of pricing that we've been able to take, which really protects our margins going forward, and its underlying the performance in Africa. We'll continue to watch the currency. It's been, I think, the government, I give great credit for doing the things that are necessary, but very, very tough for the long-term of that economy in that country. And we'll continue to watch what's really happening with the currency as we always have and think about if it continues to work towards a continued evaluation, we'll price accordingly. And we price constantly to make sure that we're keeping track of the underlying currency as we see it. And so with that, I'll turn it back over to Amit then.\nAmit Banati: Yeah. Thanks, Steve. So I think the devaluation that we are seeing right now is more of a catch-up in the official rate at which we translate, I think operationally, like Steve mentioned, we've been operating against the de facto devaluation that's happened. And you can see that in our pricing. And you can see that in our NSV growth, which has been north of 20% for the last few quarters. I think from a translation standpoint, Nigeria is about 10% of our sales. So with the devaluation, it's about a 4% impact on our overall NSV, which will be split between the two years, 2% this year and 2% next year. This has been incorporated into our ForEx guidance. So the guidance that I gave based on today's rates, of course, of around a 3% impact on NSV that incorporates the Naira devaluation. I'd also say that the impact on OP and EPS is less than 1%, and that's also been incorporated into the 1% negative impact of currency on the EPS. So that's Nigeria. I think from a gross margin standpoint, no, we're not -- we continue to expect gross margins to expand in the second half. So there's no change in trend. I think there's a little bit of variation based on seasonality between the quarters. But I think from an underlying standpoint, we continue to expect gross margin to be up in the second half.\nSteve Powers: Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone. Just a quick one for me. But thinking about the Investor Day next week. Can you clarify whether we'll get a guidance range on either earnings per share, or adjusted operating profit for each of the two businesses for 2024?\nAmit Banati: Yeah, that's our intent. So I think our intent is to talk both give you a preliminary guidance given it's early on 2024, talk about long-term growth rates across key measures.\nAlexia Howard: And guidance for next year as well, at least preliminary guidance with the range?\nAmit Banati: Yes.\nAlexia Howard: Perfect. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks operator. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to follow-up, I guess, on Pam's question. She asked a bit about investment shift to the back half. And I guess maybe just stepping back, like just looking at it more broadly, if we look at SG&A as a percentage of sales, it's running and it's been, I guess, the last six or eight quarters, it's been running about 200 basis points as a percentage of sales below where it was before last year. And so, I guess, as we kind of look thinking about that going forward, right? Is that kind of the new run rate? Is there still some rebasing of marketing spends that has to happen? So just really trying to understand, where SG&A as a percentage of sales have been running in roughly 20% range for a long time, and now we're or 20% to 21% and now we're kind of high 18%, 19%. Just is this really a good run rate going forward, or is there more spend that still has to be put back? Thank you.\nA \u2013 Amit Banati: Yeah. I think, so firstly, there's been some phasing, right, when you compare it versus 2020 versus 2022. And we talked that, we started the year saying it will be much more first half weighted. I think that has shifted a little bit between first half and second half. I think to your question around levels of advertising, we're pleased with the levels of advertising. So I don't think we expect any rebasing needed going forward. On SG&A, we are catching up as meetings, travel, business returns to pre-pandemic levels. So I think that you'll see that catch-up I'd say that overall, you'd expect overheads to be up mid-single digits is to be up slightly higher than what we increased in 2022. So in 2022, we were up we'd probably be up this year as well at a slightly higher rate.\nQ \u2013 Bryan Spillane: Okay. So it sounds as, if we're thinking about SG&A as a percentage of sales, if we go back past 2022, right, if you look at 2020, 2021, just the years before, it sounds like it's going to be net and lower as a percentage of sales, but the run rate was leading up before the pandemic?\nA \u2013 Amit Banati: Yeah. I mean, there's been a lot of pricing that has come through. So I think we've been in this period of exceptional pricing. So, some of the ratios probably are displaced a little bit as that pricing has worked its way through the P&L.\nQ \u2013 Bryan Spillane: That's great. Thanks Amit. That's very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Dickerson of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nA \u2013 Amit Banati: Rob? Are you on mute?\nQ \u2013 Robert Dickerson: Hello? Can you hear me?\nA \u2013 Amit Banati: Yes. Now we can.\nQ \u2013 Robert Dickerson: I am sorry. Yeah. Yes, I just want to ask a broader question around [indiscernible] strike. If you think for like two quarters it seems kind of habitability as to why do you think that actually fully recovered, [indiscernible]?\nA \u2013 Amit Banati: Rob, I think you were not entirely -- you're a little breaking up, but I think the question was around R-Tech and R-Tech recovery and where we see it. So I'll answer that question. I think that's what you're asking. We continue to recover the share. We talked about in the prepared remarks. In the first half of 2023, we gained 1.5 points year-on-year. We're also up year-on-year on a 13-week basis and a four-week basis. We're still recovering items. We're still recovering distribution points, and we see that continuing to recover. We have a long tail of SKUs we had. We took the opportunity to chop some of that tail to make efficiency gains in our plants, but there's still some recovery happening with the long-tail SKUs that we did not chop. And so we still see recovery on the horizon. I wouldn't really call it a recovery, but I just see it as ongoing momentum as we get back to where we were pre strike from a share perspective. And I think you'll see some ambitious plans next week. There should be no ceiling for our share ambitions when we think about what the potential of this business is. But we're pleased with the momentum. We're pleased with the plant performance. We mentioned also in the prepared remarks, we're running company and company right now, which is really exciting. We did the cutover over the weekend. And one of the things that means is there's now a separate sales organization for North American Cereal, which is, I think, one of the really exciting developments as we talk about two companies, two quality companies going forward. And so you'll have a sales organization that's 100% focused on North American cereal and they'll have goals that are ambitious and I think very achievable as we continue to look forward for North American cereal and what its true potential is.\nQ \u2013 Robert Dickerson: Okay. Super. And then I guess just one quick follow-up is kind of pertaining, I guess, to Mr. Palmer's question earlier, just on the North America cereal profitability, that you provided us in Form 10. Is there anything kind of inherent within those profitability margins that could have been, let's say, kind of weighing on profitability potential again, more broadly speaking, relative to maybe what could come?\nA \u2013 AmitBanati: Yes. We'll talk it in context next week. And I think we'll talk about the history as well as the go-forward plans, suffice to say that we've been through fire and in strike and that had an impact on the margin. So, I think maybe we'll have a fuller conversation on that next week.\nQ \u2013 Robert Dickerson: Fair enough. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nQ \u2013 MichaelLavery: Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to understand a couple of things on volumes. You've walked through the sales growth split by category and ways that would add up to W.K. Kellogg and Kellanova. But can you give how the volume split would have looked for each of those on a company NewCo basis for the second quarter?\nA \u2013 JohnRenwick: We haven't .Yes, we haven't split it out.\nA \u2013 SteveCahillane: We haven't split that, Michael. Next week, we will -- I mean, you're going to get a lot of detail next week about what it looks like and what our forecasts are going forward. But in terms of category splits on volume, it's not a level of detail that we've provided.\nQ \u2013 Michael Lavery: Okay. And just on emerging markets, obviously, you had the serial comp, the restocking and a lot of things in the US and some different dynamics in developed markets. But EMEA volumes were also down that they had -- they were down a bit last year. What would be necessary to see better volume growth there? That's usually kind of historically where you would expect it is emerging markets. And so, can you just give us a sense of maybe what some of the pressure is there? Is it just macro? I know you mentioned the launch -- the expansion into places like South Africa, but how does that look going ahead? Should -- is that pressure likely to remain? When does it pick up? How do we think about that?\nA \u2013 AmitBanati: Yes. I think we've seen elasticities rising in the quarter, right? We had expected that. We had focused that, and this quarter, in quarter two, we saw that. And I think we saw it in talking on EMEA or Latin America. In Latin America, we saw it in our cereal business, our cookies and crackers business in Brazil. We also did some rationalization of low-margin SKUs as part of our revenue growth management. So you're seeing that come through in the quarter. And I think it's really elasticities given the pricing that we've taken, and we talked a little bit about currency in Nigeria, where we've had to price not just for commodities, but also currency. So you're seeing the elasticities come through. I think going forward, from a lever standpoint, I think Steve talked about we've got -- we're excited about the commercial plan that we have in the second half. And I think as you start lapping the pricing, there'll be more balance between volume and price mix.\nQ \u2013 Michael Lavery: Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Smith of Stifel. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nQ \u2013 Matt Smith: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I want to follow-up on the commentary about the consumer environment and the category dynamics we're seeing where some categories we're seeing clearly a softer elasticity response lately. When you think about your promotional spending going forward, are there categories where you expect that to pick up in relation to where it was on a pre-pandemic basis, I'm thinking here, if you're approaching the cereal category differently than you are the snacking category, given the volume slowdown we've seen that seems to be more evident in cereal relative to the snacking categories where elasticities have been more stable overall?\nA \u2013 Steve Cahillane: Yes. I think a couple of things. First, it's a bit of a tough comparison when you think about in North America cereal versus our snacks business because our cereal is obviously coming out of a very depressed environment because of the fire and the strike, really no promotional activity, no merchandising activity, and so we've got a ways to go to get back to where it was on a pre-pandemic basis, but we have every confidence that we're moving in that direction -- as our supply chain is working. I mean, it's working really at a pre-pandemic level in cereal, which is terrific. I already mentioned the replenishment of SKUs, the growth of distribution points and ACV. So we see that really moving in the right direction. From a snacking perspective, it's always been a very highly impulsive category. And so coming out of bottlenecks and shortages and low service levels, you don't get the type of quality display that really drives the type that we're used to seeing if your service levels aren't above the 95 percentage rate. And so as we think about the back half of the year and some of the things I've mentioned around quality merchandising and our confidence in our supply chain, we see that as a big opportunity for us going forward for brands like Pringles, Cheez-It, Rice Krispies treats, which are highly impulsive. Front end is important. Display disruption opportunities throughout the store is really important. And so we see -- we're really pleased with the type of plans that we have in place for the back half of the year that we think will drive continued good performance, which is why we're more constructive about volume going forward. And look at this past quarter's volume performance is in North America, as whether you call it a high watermark or a low watermark, but moving better -- moving clearly in a better direction based on everything that we see.\nQ \u2013 Matt Smith: Thank you for that, Steve. Looking forward to seeing everybody in next week and I\u2019ll leave it there and pass it on.\nA \u2013 Steve Cahillane: Okay. Thank you.\nJohn Renwick: All right, operator, I don't think we have time. We are at the half hour here. Thanks, everyone, for your interest, and please contact us if you have any follow-up questions to ask.\nOperator: Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Steve Cahillane",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another better than expected quarter featuring two key elements depicted on slide number 5. Not only did we sustain top line growth that remained better than our long-term targets, but we did so across our portfolio and geographies with growth in all major category groups in each of our four regions. And we did so even as we lapped the prior year's retail inventory replenishment and particularly strong in-market performance. We also continued to experience a sooner-than sooner than expected recovery in our gross profit margin. Much of this is related to bottlenecks and shortages diminishing. This recovery is ahead of schedule and it was a principal driver behind our better than expected profit and earnings this quarter. Also encouraging is the momentum, we've continued to see in our biggest, most differentiated brands shown on slide number 6. These advantage brands made up half of our net sales in 2022 and they continue to outpace our overall growth creating both top-line momentum and a favorable margin mix. So when we put it all together the earlier than expected margin recovery and the sustained top-line growth across our portfolio, you can see why we feel comfortable raising our full year sales profit and earnings guidance again. We also remain very active on our social and environmental program Kellogg's Better Days Promise. Slide number 7 shows just a few examples of actions we took during the quarter, including donations and volunteering in the area of hunger and tie-ins to important commercial programs with customers. The slide also shows another wave of recognitions that we have received, simply confirming what we already know, that doing what is right is in our DNA. In the center of the slide, you can see that we have published an update regarding our progress toward our Better Days targets. On social goals like addressing hunger or environmental goals like reducing our admissions or in diversity goals like gender representation and management, we remain ahead of pace on our Better Days goals. And of course, we remain very busy in getting ready for our pending separation. Indeed on slide number eight most of what you see under the Q1, Q2 and the Q2, Q3 phases are now complete. The team has done an exceptional job of digging into every detail, every brand, every process, every role to make sure we have left no stone unturned in our quest to create two successful value-creating companies. And as you look to the Q3 phase, you can see a few milestones that are very much upon us. On July 24th WK Kellogg Co.'s Form-10 was filed publicly providing you with important information about management, strategy, capital structure, and carve out financials. On July 30th, just this past Sunday, we began to run WK Kellogg Co. and Kelanova in parallel. By running the water through the pipes, so to speak, we can identify and address any process gaps and other opportunities well before the separation takes place. Employees in new roles can transition properly. Services under the transition services agreement can be ironed out more completely. And while this requires incremental expenses, they are already incorporated into our guidance. And then less than a week from today on August 9th, we will host our Day at K investor event at which leaders of both WK Kellogg Co. and Kellenova will present to the strategies, the capital structures, and the financial outlooks for both companies. And we still expect the separation transaction to take place during the fourth quarter. Because we can't know the exact timing of the various customary approvals, we can't be more specific than that quite yet. But we have every confidence that it is on track. In sum, the second quarter was another very good quarter in terms of financial results, sustainability actions, and progress toward our spinoff. And now let me turn it over to Amit to take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail. Thanks, Amit. With the spin-off approaching, we'll once again organize our discussion around the businesses that will comprise Kellenova and WK Kellogg. Slide number 19 reminds you of the composition of the two businesses, and on the slide you can see how both remain in good form with good top-line growth. Let's start by discussing the Kelinova businesses leading off with our emerging markets regions. Slide number 20 shows the financial performance of our EMEA region. This region sustained its outstanding underlying momentum in the second quarter, posting mid-teens organic net sales growth on top of extremely strong comparisons. It again expanded its operating profit margin year-on-year in the second quarter, and it again posted exceptional 19% operating profit growth. And this performance came in spite of exceedingly high cost inflation and reinvestment into the business. Drilling down into its key category groups, we see on slide number 21 that EMEA's snacks sustained double-digit organic net sales growth in quarter two, with this growth coming on top of exceptional growth in the year-ago quarter. In market, snacks category growth rates remained elevated and have even accelerated slightly from the previous quarter. Pringles this year has outpaced the salty snacks category that is growing in the high-teens or better across key markets and during the second quarter we continued to gain share in markets like Australia, Japan, Korea and Thailand. EMEA cereal is also sustaining strong growth momentum as shown on slide number 22. This business delivered growth on top of last year's strong growth with particular strength in Australia, Africa, and the Middle East, North Africa, Turkey sub-region. And in market, we've outpaced a category this year that has grown in the mid single digits collectively across key markets which brings us to noodles and other and slide number 23. Led by Multipro in Nigeria, this business continued to deliver organic net sales growth in excess of 20% in the second quarter. Multipro continues to execute extremely well, widening its competitive moat and staying on an impressive growth trajectory in an always exciting market. Meanwhile, we continue to expand our Kellogg's noodles business outside of Nigeria. In the second quarter, net sales of Kellogg's noodles grew significantly year-on-year in both South Africa and Egypt. As you know the Nigerian Naira has been officially devalued recently but our team has been proactively managing through de facto currency devaluation for some time in order to protect our margins. Much of this proactive pricing which has contributed to the 20% plus growth you see on the slide is behind us now. This reflects the experience and savvy of our local team and the strength of this business. And we expect continued, if moderated top line growth going forward. Clearly, EMEA is a growth engine for Kellogg Company and soon, Kellanova. And it is performing extremely well so far in 2023. For the full year, we continue to expect sustained momentum across all three category groups, delivering yet another year of organic net sales growth, and while improving our profit margins. Let's turn to our other emerging markets region, Latin America, starting on slide number 25. Kellogg Latin America, in the second quarter delivered another quarter of strong organic net sales growth on top of equally strong growth last year. This growth was led by our two largest markets, Mexico and Brazil. We again expanded our operating margin in the second quarter leading to another quarter of operating profit growth of 20% year-on-year. As shown on slide number 26, our snacks business in Latin America was up against an unusually high comparison in the second quarter, but its organic net sales growth was a solid 6% year-on-year through the first half. In market, we saw sustained double-digit growth for the salty snacks category in Mexico and Brazil, and Pringles has gained share in both of these key markets. We also outpaced a very strong portable wholesome snacks category in Mexico and stabilized our share in cookies in Brazil. On slide number 27 you can see that Kellogg Latin America again recorded double-digit organic net sales growth in cereal. This growth was broad-based with good growth across each of our sub regions. In market cereal category growth rates remain robust in the region and in the second quarter we kept pace in Mexico and we gained share in Brazil and Puerto Rico. So Latin America continues to perform well and remains right on track. For the full year, we continue to expect this region to sustain strong top-line momentum with growth in both snacks and cereal and continued recovery in its profit margins, all while working on separating its Caribbean cereal business as part of the spinoff. Once again, we can see that both of our emerging markets regions are showing current momentum to go with their outstanding long-term prospects. Now let's turn to our developed markets, starting with Kellogg Europe and slide number 29. The region posted sustained top-line growth, accelerating to 11% organic growth in the second quarter. Operating profit declined once again due to Russia, which we divested just after the end of the quarter. Excluding Russia, Kellogg Europe's operating profit increased in the mid-single digits in spite of extremely high cost pressures. So our underlying European business is performing very well. On slide number 30, you can see that snacks which represent just over half of our sales in Kellogg Europe continue to lead our growth in this region. In fact quarter two marked the eighth quarter in the last ten in which we have posted double-digit growth in our European snacks business. This was growth on top of strong year-ago growth and it was driven by both volume and price mix. The growth was also broad-based with double-digit gains in all sub-regions except for suspended shipments into Russia. In market the salty snacks category remains in strong double-digit growth across key markets with Pringles gaining share in key markets like Italy and France and sustaining strong consumption growth in spite of lapping notably robust year ago performance in markets like the UK, Germany and Spain. And in portable wholesome snacks, we are experiencing double-digit consumption growth overall in the region paced by a two-point share gain in the UK led by Rice Krispies Squares. Our cereal business in Europe, shown on Slide number 31, also sustained growth in the second quarter. Growth has slowed as we've discussed previously, owing to category elasticities rising, but we continue to execute well in a challenging market. So it was another good quarter for Kellogg Europe, keeping us right on track for another good year. For the full year, we continue to expect the region to post yet another year of solid top line growth, led by Snacks. We'll continue to navigate through cost pressures, which were particularly heavy in the first half, and we have a plan to gradually improve margins during the second half. And as we mentioned, we have closed on our divestiture of our Russia business. We'll now turn to Kellogg North America and Slide number 33. As anticipated, net sales growth decelerated in the second quarter as elasticity continued to move higher and as we lapped last year's sizable replenishment of trade inventories. However, mid-teens price mix growth was sustained and we delivered solid organic growth in net sales. Importantly, we continue to recover gross profit margin, reflecting productivity, revenue growth management and diminishing bottlenecks and shortages. This enabled us to increase investments in our brands and still deliver 14% operating profit growth year-on-year. This region again generated organic net sales growth in all three category groups in the second quarter. Slide number 34 shows snacks, which represents over half of our North American net sales. In the second quarter, it grew net sales by 5% on top of a notably strong year earlier quarter, which had included retailer inventory replenishment. We also grew in frozen foods, shown on Slide number 35. In market, Eggo's consumption growth improved in the second quarter, continuing to moderate its share losses as our supply has improved. And Morningstar Farms gained share in the quarter as its supply is improving as well. All of the regions and categories we have discussed up to now will be part of Kellanova, and all of them are showing continued net sales growth to go with progress towards recovering margins. Now let's turn to our North America cereal business which forms the vast majority of what will soon be W.K. Kellogg Co. As shown on Slide number 36, this business continues to recover, growing its net sales in the second quarter despite lapping substantial retailer inventory replenishment last year. In the US the category remained in high single-digit growth in spite of gradually rising elasticities. Led by brands like Corn Flakes, Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies and Raisin brand, we continue to gain share year-on-year and we continue to activate more commercial support, increase our distribution and increase our velocities. A similar recovery is happening in Canada, where we also continued to gain share in the second quarter. So this business is back on solid footing with more to come. Turning to Slide number 37. Our North America region had a very strong first half, giving us confidence in our full year expectations. Snacks should remain solidly in growth while Frozen is expected to continue to show improved performance, and our North America cereal business continues its recovery. We are off to an earlier-than-expected start to margin recovery in this region even as we reinvest more in our brands. So North America is in good shape as we set up for the spin-off of W.K. Kellogg Co. later this year. So let me summarize on Slide number 39. We continue to put up better-than-expected results. Our first half featured top line growth across our regions and across our categories with notable momentum in snacks around the world and our businesses in emerging markets. It also featured an earlier-than-expected recovery in profit margins, which enables us to reinvest in the business and sustain strong earnings and cash flow growth. Thanks to the passion and skill of our organization, we have not allowed the spin-off work to prevent us from delivering and even overdelivering on our plans. In fact, we're halfway through the year, and we've already raised our full year outlook twice. And the work we are doing for the spin-off will pay off. We are separating this great company into two, even better companies, one with enhanced focus and the fit-for-purpose strategy and resourcing it deserves and the other with a portfolio-oriented solidly towards growth. And we'll share with you our plans for both companies at our Day 8-K investor event next week. And with that, we'll open up the line for your questions. Yes, I'd say a good bit due to the replenishment and we're potentially seeing some retailer de-stocking. It's really hard to pin down when you're talking about a quarter. And we see that as a good thing, Cody. Obviously, service levels for the last year plus have been below normal levels, which required safety stock across the supply chain. As we get to service levels back above 95%, you'd see a renewed confidence, a growing confidence at retail and therefore, not needing to carry the same days of supply. And again, we don't see that as a negative. And we see, as we said, from a go-forward perspective, lots of confidence in our plans, which has led to us raising our guidance for the top line slightly. See you next week. Stay tuned for an exciting event next week, David. Yeah, Pam, maybe I'll start and then flip it to Amit. I'd say we have clearly increased our investment in A&P in the first half of the year as we said we would. We were maybe a little bit more judicious as we continue to work through bottlenecks and shortages and get our confidence in our supply chain back to where it needs to be to really drive the type of quality merchandising that we want to drive. And so we see more ambitious plans in the second half. So we'll see an increase above the run rate that we had in the first half as we drive really good program against Pringles and Cheez-It, our cereal business and so forth. So, continued investment in the brands in a constructive way to drive good quality displays, and promotions on the floor into the second half. And so that's what you see happening. A little bit of dynamism going forward, but a confidence in our supply chain is a lot more solid than I'd say it's been really since the pandemic. I don't know, Amit, if you want to? Yes. I'd say -- and we've talked about this in the past, Europe is probably under more strain in terms of household budgets than North America. But we performed very well in the second quarter, obviously, you saw our snacks grow nearly 20% on an organic basis. You saw positive growth in cereal. And so from that perspective, our brands are performing well. Our relationships with our customers are very, very constructive. We find the overlap of what they need for their consumers, which we share as we think about putting together promotions and programs that address a strained household budget environment in Europe. But I'd say the brands have performed very well. Our customer teams have performed in an excellent manner as we've executed unprecedented revenue growth management activities in Europe, and really continue to operate in a situation where household budgets remain under pressure. And for the foreseeable future, I think we'll continue to remain under pressure. But underlying that is a resilient consumer who continues to spend against discretionary items like Pringles and like our cereal brands. Yes, I'll start with the Africa topline and then turn it to Amit to build on that and then address your gross margin question. I'd say the African team has really shown their skill, their savvy, their experience because we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've seen the devaluation of the de facto basis and have been transacting pretty much at the rate that it was the value to or close to it. And so that's why you see the level of pricing that we've been able to take, which really protects our margins going forward, and its underlying the performance in Africa. We'll continue to watch the currency. It's been, I think, the government, I give great credit for doing the things that are necessary, but very, very tough for the long-term of that economy in that country. And we'll continue to watch what's really happening with the currency as we always have and think about if it continues to work towards a continued evaluation, we'll price accordingly. And we price constantly to make sure that we're keeping track of the underlying currency as we see it. And so with that, I'll turn it back over to Amit then."

            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide number 10 provides a summary of our second quarter and first half results. Net sales growth in quarter two was 7% on an organic basis. Importantly, this growth remained broad-based across category groups and regions, and paces us a little ahead of our previous full-year outlook. Operating profit grew 14% on an adjusted basis. This growth came on top of last year's 10% currency neutral growth, and it featured the sooner than expected recovery in gross profit margin that Steve discussed. This operating profit performance puts us a little ahead of our previous full year outlook. Earnings per share grew 5% on an adjusted basis, sustaining mid-single-digit growth in spite of macro-related headwinds versus last year on below-the-line items such as interest expense and pension income. Cash flow through the first half is down year-on-year because of outlays related to the pending spin-off but on track for the full year. Let's now discuss each of these in more detail. Slide number 11 splits our year-on-year net sales growth into its components. Price mix growth was sustained in the mid-teens with growth in both developed markets and emerging markets. As expected, price elasticities continued to move higher around the world, and this weighed down our volume. Also contributing to our volume decline was lapping last year's replenishment of trade inventories, particularly as we recovered from the serial strike. Foreign currency translation continued to negatively impact net sales growth by nearly 3% year-on-year in the quarter. If today's exchange rates versus the US dollar were to hold, we would expect to see a similar impact in the second half, as the favorable impact of lapping last year's dollar strengthening is offset by the recent devaluation of the Nigerian naira. So our top line growth in quarter two supports our long-standing planning assumptions for elasticities to rise and for revenue growth management actions to begin to anniversary. Next, let's discuss gross profit shown on slide number 12. As we've discussed numerous times, our objective in this high inflation environment has been to protect gross profit dollars via productivity savings and revenue growth management. In quarter two, our adjusted gross profit increased by 9% year-on-year. On top of a year ago quarter that itself was up more than 6% on a currency-neutral basis. From a margin perspective, recall that our expectation was for a gradual improvement as the year progresses. But as Steve mentioned, we are ahead of pace in this recovery with year-on-year expansion coming sooner than expected. Much of this is driven by bottlenecks and shortages receding, which eliminates many of the inefficiencies and incremental costs experienced over the past year or more. In addition, productivity and revenue growth management continue to catch up to a high market-driven input cost inflation. So while we have a ways to go before we get back to pre-pandemic levels, this performance gives us increased confidence in our ability to recover margins. For 2023, there is no change to our outlook for expansion in the second half, but Q2's better-than-expected performance moves up our full year outlook for gross margin to be somewhere around 50 basis points of expansion year-on-year. Operating profit, as shown on slide number 13, grew 14% year-on-year in quarter two, even as it laps a robust 10% gain in the year earlier quarter, and even with advertising and promotion investment increasing year-on-year. Through the first half, our operating profit was up 16% year-on-year. Our second half comparisons get a little tougher, and we have begun to run W.K. Kellogg Company in parallel requiring incremental expenses year-on-year that are already baked into our guidance. That, we are ahead of pace, and this gives us the confidence to raise our full year operating profit guidance. Moving down the income statement. Slide number 14 shows that our earnings per share growth has been attributable to operating profit, which has grown enough to more than offset what are severe macro-related headwinds in within our below-the-line items. These below-the-line pressures were expected and will continue through the year. Interest expense increased significantly year-on-year due to higher interest rates. In the second half, we expect to see modestly lower interest expense than we recorded in the first half, owing to the timing of cash flow. Other income decreased sharply year-on-year in each of the first two quarters this year. reflecting the accounting of pension and postretirement plan asset values and interest rates stemming from last year's declines in financial markets. Owing to favorability in some other items in the slide, Q2 came in higher than both Q1 and the run rate we would expect for the remaining quarters. Our effective tax rate in quarter two was back to the kind of 22% rate we would expect for the full year after being a bit above that in quarter one. Average shares outstanding were up slightly year-on-year in both quarter one and quarter two. And we would expect that to be the case for the full year as well. Foreign currency translation turned slightly positive to EPS in quarter two, finishing the half with about a negative 1% impact. We leave foreign currency translation out of our guidance because it is out of our control and difficult to predict. But if we took today's exchange rates, including a substantially devalued Nigerian Naira partially offset by the lapping of other currencies a year ago weakening, we would estimate a similar impact for the full year as that of the first half. A key message here is that these below the line items are collectively weighing down EPS as expected, but it is important to remember that the operational side of our P&L through operating profit remains very strong. Turning to slide number 15, we see that cash flow is below last year's high level. This is due to three factors. First, one-time cash outlays related to the spin-off amounting to roughly $130 million. Secondly, lapping unusually strong inflows in the year-ago period, including some related to derivatives. And thirdly, timing of capital expenditure, which last year was much more weighted to the second half due to supply disruptions earlier that year. So while it is down from a high level last year, we believe cash flow is right on track to achieve our full year guidance. Meanwhile, we continue to reduce our debt leverage year-on-year, further enhancing our financial flexibility. All in, our second quarter performance puts us slightly ahead of pace for the full year. Accordingly, we are once again moving up our full year guidance as shown on slide number 16. We are raising our guidance for organic net sales growth to approximately 7%, which is the high end of our previous guidance range. Our quarter two performance was consistent with our assumption of decelerating growth as the year progresses, which reflects a likely return of elasticity towards historical levels as well as lapping of particularly substantial revenue growth management actions in the second half of last year. This 7% organic growth is well above our long-term target. We are raising our guidance for adjusted operating profit growth to 9%-10% on a currency-neutral basis, which is the upper half of our previous guidance range. This raise reflects a stronger-than-expected Q2 performance, particularly our earlier recovery in gross profit margin, and yet still accounts for some investment shifts into the second half as well as incremental costs in the second half for operating WK Kellogg Company in parallel as a company within a company. We expect to improve margins this year which combined with our above target net sales growth will deliver operating profit growth that is also above our long-term target. Based on the improved operating profit outlook, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance as well, now looking for a year-on-year decline of 1% to 2%, the upper portion of our previous guidance range. Remember that all and more of this decline is explained by the year-on-year reduction in pension and post-retirement income, a non-operating, non-cash item that is expected to have a negative impact of nearly 7% on EPS this year. The negative impact of higher interest expense due to higher interest rates in the economy is another negative impact of more than 4%. If it weren't for these two macro-related impacts, our guidance for EPS growth would also be well above a long-term growth rate. Our guidance for cash flow remains at $1 to $1.1 billion. Recall that, within this guidance, we are expecting a year-on-year increase in our underlying cash flow offset by one-time cash costs and capital related to the spin-off. A couple of elements to keep in mind regarding this guidance. First, while we expect the spin-off to be transacted during quarter four our guidance assumes it takes place at year-end purely for simplicity reasons. And secondly, the impact of our recently completed divestiture of our Russian business does not have a material impact on our guidance. So to summarize our financial position on slide number 17, quarter two was yet another quarter of over-delivery and we have plans in place to sustain our earnings momentum. Accordingly, we are again raising our full year guidance for 2023. Our profit margins have expanded sooner than anticipated and this should continue, particularly as our service levels return to normal. Our net sales growth remains strong and while we are keeping our assumption of rising elasticity in the second half, along with lapping sizable revenue growth management actions, we are confident enough in our top-line growth to raise our full-year outlook. Our financial flexibility is strong, marked by a solid balance sheet and cash flow that remains in good shape, even with some adverse timing in the first half. We continue to make good progress on setting up both Kellanova and WK Kellogg for operational and financial success, and we are looking forward to sharing with you the two companies' exciting strategies, capital structures, and financial outlooks next week. And with that, I'll turn it back to Steve to walk you through our individual businesses. Yeah. So just a couple of further builds, right? I think the one thing I'd point out is in quarter two, the inventory lap was the most pronounced. So I think that was most pronounced in this quarter. And so I think going forward, that will be lesser of an impact. I think from a rest of the year, we continue to focus decelerating sales growth. That's what's been implied. That's what's implied in our guidance. And it's a couple of things that's driving that. One is, we obviously start lapping last year's substantial revenue growth management actions, which were that much higher in the second half. And we continue to prudently assume higher elasticities for the rest of the year. Yeah. So I wouldn't say there's a change in trend. I think we had always said gross margin would be up during the year. I think based on -- it's coming in faster than we expected, predominantly driven by bottlenecks and shortages receding faster than what we had thought. So I think the supply chain is performing really well. Are we seeing that in cost, we're seeing that in service levels. We'd expect that trend to continue. And I think when you kind of put it all together, our forecast right now is that we should be up about 50 basis points for the year. Yeah. So I think we continue to recover both share and margin as that business recovers from the fire in strike through the cycle of replenishing inventory and full commercial execution. So that recovery is well underway, both from our top line share as well as a margin standpoint. And I think the go forward, we'll obviously discuss fully next week. No. I think there's been some shift. We always talk this year that we'd be lapping last year's pull down, right, as we went -- as we were building inventories in the first half of 2022. So, for the half, we were up mid-single digits on for the half in A&P. And so -- the quarter and so I think we'd expect some shifting of that into the second half. Yeah. Thanks, Steve. So I think the devaluation that we are seeing right now is more of a catch-up in the official rate at which we translate, I think operationally, like Steve mentioned, we've been operating against the de facto devaluation that's happened. And you can see that in our pricing. And you can see that in our NSV growth, which has been north of 20% for the last few quarters. I think from a translation standpoint, Nigeria is about 10% of our sales. So with the devaluation, it's about a 4% impact on our overall NSV, which will be split between the two years, 2% this year and 2% next year. This has been incorporated into our ForEx guidance. So the guidance that I gave based on today's rates, of course, of around a 3% impact on NSV that incorporates the Naira devaluation. I'd also say that the impact on OP and EPS is less than 1%, and that's also been incorporated into the 1% negative impact of currency on the EPS. So that's Nigeria. I think from a gross margin standpoint, no, we're not -- we continue to expect gross margins to expand in the second half. So there's no change in trend. I think there's a little bit of variation based on seasonality between the quarters. But I think from an underlying standpoint, we continue to expect gross margin to be up in the second half. Yeah, that's our intent. So I think our intent is to talk both give you a preliminary guidance given it's early on 2024, talk about long-term growth rates across key measures. Yes."

            "content": "Yeah. Thanks, Cody. As I mentioned, volumes were in line with our expectations. It doesn't mean we're pleased about it, but take the level of pricing that we've taken, you have to see elasticity's moving higher, which is exactly what we've seen. Our quarter two was amplified by lapping the year ago trade inventory replenishment in North America. There's no question about that. In Latin America, more than a third of our volume decline in the second quarter came from price pack architecture and calling of lower-margin SKUs, which was very much planned. So we've been planning on these elasticities returning and they have returned. I would say, on a go-forward basis, we're more optimistic and more constructive about our volumes. So I don't see \u2013 I don't see this volume continuing this level. I see sequential improvement, and we do see, as we'll talk about next week in great detail exactly what that looks like as we return to a more balanced equation of volume versus price, but there's no question, this has been an unprecedented time in this industry with the type of pricing that's been necessary to take because of the input cost inflation. But we've got lots of dry powder as we think about the second half of the year to drive real quality merchandising. I'm talking about display execution, brand building with significant advertising spend, really creating those connections with our consumers. So, in line with expectations, admittedly a high volume decline, but nothing that surprised us going forward. And maybe Amit can build on that."

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session with publishing analysts. At this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for Kellogg Company. Mr. Renwick, you may begin your conference call.\nJohn Renwick: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you, for joining us today for a review of our first quarter results and an update on our outlook for 2023. I'm joined this morning by Steve Cahillane, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Amit Banati, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. Slide number 3 shows our forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware, certain statements made today such as projections for Kellogg Company's future performance, are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the third slide of this presentation, as well as to our public SEC filings. A recording of today's webcast and supporting documents will be archived for at least 90 days on the Investor page of kelloggcompany.com. As always, when referring to our results and outlook, unless otherwise noted, we will be referring to them on an organic basis for net sales and on a currency-neutral adjusted basis for operating profit and earnings per share. And now, I'll turn it over to Steve.\nSteven Cahillane: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to be able to report a very strong start to the year. In fact, it was stronger than we had anticipated and puts us in the enviable position of being able to raise our outlook for the full-year. Our topline growth momentum continues as shown on Slide number 5. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic net sales growth. And beneath the magnitude of our Q1 growth are promising trends. We continue to deliver above our long-term growth target. We continue to deliver broad-based growth across each of our four regions and across each of our four major category groups. Our soon-to-be Kellanova businesses continue to grow strongly, led by snacks in emerging markets, all paced by our highly differentiated world-class brands. Our soon-to-be WK Kellogg Co. businesses continue to show recovery in net sales, consumption and share. We have continued to execute revenue growth management actions across our businesses right through the first quarter in order to keep up with high input cost inflation and we have supported our growth with sustained innovation and with the supply improving, increased brand-building investment. So we feel very good about our topline growth momentum and outlook. We also feel good about restoring our profit margins. We said that this would be a year in which we stabilize and even improve our margins after being pressured the last couple of years by soaring input cost inflation, and inefficiencies in costs related to bottlenecks and shortages. The chart on Slide number 6 shows that margins are indeed stabilizing. In fact, better than expected margins are what drove most of the first quarter over-delivery versus our expectations. Aside from what we are lapping, what\u2019s behind us improving underlying margin performance is what gives us increased confidence in the full-year. Firstly, we continue to execute well on productivity initiatives and revenue growth management actions, both of which are starting to more fully catch up with our input cost inflation. Second, we continue to improve our service levels and the bottlenecks and shortages that had created so much disruption are finally receding. So while costs remain high, we are pleased with the quick and pace of our profit margin recovery. And it's not just the financials that are off to a good start in 2023, Kellogg\u2019s Better Days Promise, our social and environmental program continues to be a strategic priority for us. And as shown on Slide number 7, we were as active as ever in these areas during the first quarter. From actions visible in the marketplace, shown on the left-hand side of the page, the philanthropic and sustainability activities in the middle column, we continue to take an action-oriented approach. And the far right column shows that these actions continue to be recognized. We believe ESG is one of Kellogg Company's differentiating strengths and it will continue to be when we are Kellanova and WK Kellogg. And speaking of Kellanova and WK Kellogg, we are very pleased with how our spin-off work is progressing. Slide number 8 offers a high-level timeline of the work we are doing in order to be able to set up both companies for success, provide you with the strategic and financial information you need and execute the transaction. Everything is progressing well. The announcement of new company names has been well received by stakeholders. The organizational design work is finishing up with leadership team members already announced, and the remainder of talent placements coming later in the second quarter. The design and setup of systems and processes for WK Kellogg is underway and various post-spin transition services continue to be ironed out. Prior year carve out financials are being prepared and we expect to have them audited in the next couple of months. During the third quarter, we plan to test run WK Kellogg on its own from procurement to manufacturing, to invoicing to financials. And best of all, employee sentiment and engagement remain very high. We expect to be able to provide you with information via a Form 10 sometime in late summer, followed by an investor event, likely in late third quarter, during which we will be able to share with you the strategies, capital structures, and financial outlooks for both companies. That will all lead to the transaction, which takes place in the fourth quarter. Again, some of this is dependent on timing of regulatory and other customary approvals, but it should give you assurance that the information and transaction are not far away. And most importantly, all of this preparation work has only strengthened our convection that this spin-off creates value for share owners. We are setting up both companies for success. WK Kellogg Co. will benefit from focus and resource prioritization and Kellanova will be a higher growth company with 80% of sales coming from snacks in emerging markets. Now let me turn it over to Amit, who will provide you the financial details of our first quarter and full-year outlook.\nAmit Banati: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide number 10, provides a summary of our first quarter financial results. Obviously, it was a very strong start to the year. Our 14% organic net sales growth was driven by sustained growth in price and mix. Net sales were better than expected principally because of volume. As Steve mentioned, we also performed better on profit margins than we had expected, leading to a very strong 18% increase in adjusted operating profit on a currency-neutral basis. This higher operating profit drove adjusted earnings per share to be 3% higher than last year on a currency-neutral basis. Remember, this growth is in spite of significant macro-related headwinds on our below the line items. In fact, higher interest expense and lower pension accounting income pulled EPS down by about 5 and 8 percentage points respectively, year-on-year in the quarter. Cash flow in the first three months decreased year-on-year as expected. This is related to the payout of 2022s incentive compensation in quarter one, cash outlets related to their spin-off and the timing of certain working capital items and capital expenditure. Now let's look at each metric in a little more detail. Slide number 11 lays out the components of our strong net sales growth in quarter one. Price mix growth was sustained in the mid-teens, reflecting revenue growth management initiatives around the world, which we implemented during 2022 and right through quarter one 2023 as we continue to work to offset high input cost inflation. Volume declined reflecting price elasticity, though not as much as we had expected for quarter one. Foreign currency translation reduced net sales by about 3 points, reflecting the stronger U.S. dollar against key currencies versus the prior year. As we will discuss in a moment, we are raising our organic net sales guidance for the year. Our outlook continues to prudently assume that price elasticities will sustain their upward move towards historical levels, and depending on the direction of input cost inflation that price mix will begin to lap last year's sizable revenue growth management actions. Nonetheless, there is no question that posting better than expected growth yet again in quarter one indicates strong underlying momentum in our business, giving us good confidence in our outlook. Next, let's review our gross profit performance on Slide number 12. As we've discussed numerous times, our objective in this high inflation environment has been to protect gross profit dollars via productivity savings and revenue growth management. As you can see on the chart, we have done a good job at this even considering the large and transitory impact in quarter four, 2021 and quarter one, 2022 of a fire and strike. And we've done this in spite of economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages, which have created significant inefficiencies and incremental costs. In the first quarter, we made our most progress yet. Productivity and revenue growth management continued to catch up to a high market-driven input cost inflation. Bottlenecks and shortages did diminish in the quarter a little sooner than we had projected. We did lap a negative residual impact from the fire and strike, but even excluding that estimated impact from last year, our gross profit dollars increased year-on-year. We also improved gross profit on a percentage margin basis as we lap the fire and strike and narrowed our underlying margin decline by more than we expected. Our plan was always to have a better second half than first half due to gradually improving supply conditions and the lapping of accelerated input cost inflation. This quarter one performance gives us that much more confidence that we can finish the year better than the flattish margin we had discussed previously. Slide number 13 depicts our SG&A expense, whose quarterly year-on-year changes this year are greatly affected by year-ago comparisons. As expected, our SG&A in this year's quarter one increased at a double-digit rate year-on-year as we lap in unusual decline in the year earlier period. That was when brand building had been pulled back because of supply disruptions, most notably during North America cereals inventory rebuild and as we lapped overhead, that was low because of low travel and meetings during the pandemic. As you can see on the slide, we start to lap a resumption of brand building and travel and meetings in quarter two, but it was really the second half last year when we move toward full restoration of both and also raised our incentive compensation accruals. But in absolute numbers, we feel good about our levels of investment in brands and capabilities and we remain on track for the full-year. Moving to Slide number 14, we can see that our growth in net sales and gross profit were more than enough to cover this year-on-year rise in SG&A expense, resulting in our 18% currency-neutral growth in adjusted basis operating profit. This is a fourth straight quarter of solid year-on-year growth. Importantly, we have sustained a multi-year upward trajectory on operating profit. Even excluding from the year earlier quarter, an estimated impact of the fire and strike, we continued to grow our dollars year-on-year in quarter one. In fact, our quarter one operating profit was higher than previous years quarter one operating profit as well, even dating back to prior to the Keebler divestiture. So obviously a strong start to the year and this gives us the confidence to raise our full-year guidance. Moving down the income statements, Slide number 15 shows that our operating profit growth was more than enough to offset what were severe headwinds within our below the line items. These below the line pressures were expected and will continue through the year. Interest expense increased significantly year-on-year due to higher interest rates. In dollars, we should see something close to this in each of the remaining three quarters of the year. Other income decreased sharply year-on-year, reflecting accounting of pension and post-retirement plan asset values and interest rates stemming from last year's decline in financial markets. Because of some favorability in some other items in this line, this quarter one figure is probably a little higher than what we will see in the remaining quarters. Our effective tax rate came in a little higher than expected, largely due to country mix and some other differences, and it was a little above a tax rate of about 22%. Average shares outstanding were up slightly year-on-year and we would expect that to be the case for the full-year as well. In addition, foreign currency translation was a headwind of a little more than 2%, believe foreign currency translation out of our guidance because it is out of our control and difficult to predict, but today's exchange rates would suggest a sequentially smaller impact in each remaining quarter, finishing the year with a negative impact of 1% to 2%. So while these below the line items are weighing down EPS as expected, it is important to remember that the operational side of our P&L through operating profit is very strong. Now let's turn to our cash flow and balance sheet and Slide number 16. As I mentioned earlier, our cash flow in quarter one was lower than last year's as we had expected. In addition to lapping a particularly strong year-ago period, this quarter, we experienced the payout of 2022s incentive compensation as well as incremental cash outlays related to the spin-off. Cash flow was also impacted year-on-year by timing of working capital and capital expenditure. We remain on track for our full-year guidance. Meanwhile, our net debt has been trending lower, contributing to our strong financial flexibility. So let's now summarize our guidance on Slide number 17. Keep in mind that while we expect the spin-off to be transacted during quarter four, our guidance assumes it takes place at year-end purely for simplicity reasons. Similarly, while the divestiture of our Russian business awaits government approval, our guidance assumes it remains in our portfolio for the full-year and the divestiture impact will be immaterial to adjusted basis EPS. We are raising our guidance for organic net sales growth to 6% to 7%, reflecting our better than expected performance in quarter one, which continue to demonstrate price realization and solid momentum across our portfolio. We maintained our assumption for decelerating growth as the year progresses, which reflects a likely return of elasticity towards historical levels as well as lapping a particularly substantial revenue growth management actions in the second half of last year. This 6% to 7% organic growth is well above our long-term target. We are raising our guidance for adjusted operating profit growth to 8% to 10% on a currency-neutral basis. This percentage point increase to the range reflects our stronger than expected quarter one. We feel increasingly confident in our ability to improve margins this year, which combined with our above target net sales growth will deliver operating profit growth that is also above our long-term target. Based on that improved operating profit outlook, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance as well, now looking for a year-on-year decline of 1% to 3%. Remember that this decline is more than explained by the year-on-year reduction in pension and post-retirement income, a non-operating non-cash item that is expected to have a negative impact of nearly 7 percentage points on EPS this year. The negative impact of higher interest expense due to higher interest rates in the economy is another 4% plus. If it weren't for those two macro-related impacts, our guidance for EPS would be well above our long-term growth target. Our guidance for cash flow remains at $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Recall that within this guidance, we are expecting a year-on-year increase in our underlying cash flow, offset by one-time cash costs and capital related to the spin-off. So to summarize our financial position, sustained price realization continue to generate strong topline growth around the world and across our category groups. We like how our businesses are performing and we have confidence in our full-year sales outlook. Productivity and revenue growth management actions, along with diminishing bottlenecks and shortages and improving service levels have gotten us off to a good start towards improving our profit margins. Our financial flexibility is strong, marked by a solid balance sheet and cash flow that remains in good shape, even with some adverse timing in the first three months. Our guidance for 2023 has moved higher, continuing to expect net sales growth and operating profit growth that are above our long-term targets. The fast start of quarter one gives us that much more confidence in this full-year outlook, even giving us some flexibility relative to readying ourselves for the spin-off. We continue to make good progress on setting up both Kellanova and WK Kellogg for financial success. In addition to carving out of their financials, we are managing upfront expenditures, minimizing standalone costs for WK Kellogg and stranded margin for Kellanova, and we are ensuring solid capital structures and financial flexibility for both. And with that, I'll turn it back to Steve to walk you through our individual businesses.\nSteven Cahillane: Thanks, Amit. We'll organize our discussion around the businesses that will comprise Kellanova and WK Kellogg. Slide number 20 reminds you of the composition of the two businesses. And on the slide, you can see how our topline momentum in quarter one continue to span across our portfolio with both Kellanova and WK Kellogg posting double-digit organic net sales growth. Clearly, we are heading into the spin-off with good momentum. Let's start by discussing the Kellanova businesses leading off with our emerging markets regions. Slide number 21 shows the financial performance of our EMEA region. As you can see, this region sustained its exceptional momentum in the first quarter, posting a third consecutive quarter of organic net sales growth of at least 20%. And equally impressive, it expanded its operating profit margin and accelerated its operating profit growth to 21% year-on-year, and all this in spite of exceedingly high cost inflation and reinvestment into the business. Let's break the region down into key category groups, starting with snacks on Slide number 22. EMEA snacks posted yet another quarter of explosive topline growth in the first quarter, growing net sales at an organic rate of 26% year-on-year. This growth was broad-based across all of our major sub-regions, and it was led by its biggest brand Pringles. In market, Pringles continues to significantly outpace the high-teens growth of the salty snacks category in the region with notable growth and share gains in markets like Australia, Korea, Japan and Thailand. EMEA cereal also sustained strong momentum. As shown on Slide number 23, this business delivered double-digit organic net sales growth again in the first quarter. And this growth was broad-based with growth across each of our major sub regions, Asia, Australia, Africa and the Middle East, North Africa, Turkey region. In market, we have outpaced the cereal categories mid single-digit consumption growth in the region, which brings us to noodles and other in Slide number 24. Led by Multipro in Nigeria, this business continued to deliver organic net sales growth in excess of 20% in the first quarter. Even amidst high inflation and a currency demonetization initiative, Multipro continued to thrive, clear evidence of its competitive advantage and experienced management team. Meanwhile, we continue to expand our Kellogg Noodles business outside of Nigeria. So clearly, Kellogg EMEA is firing on all cylinders. For the full-year, we continue to expect sustained momentum across all three category groups, delivering yet another year of organic net sales growth, all while improving our profit margins. Now let's discuss Latin America, starting on Slide number 26. Kellogg Latin America in the first quarter delivered another quarter of double-digit organic net sales growth. This growth was led by Mexico, but we also saw strong growth in Brazil and our Central America and Caribbean sub-region. We expanded our operating margin in the first quarter, helping to grow our operating profit by 20% year-on-year, albeit lapping notably high cost in the year earlier quarter. Our snacks business in Latin America continued to deliver double-digit organic net sales growth as shown on Slide number 27. This growth was led by Pringles with notably strong growth in Mexico and Brazil. In market, the salty snacks category sustained double-digit growth in those two markets, and Pringles gained share in both. We also have kept pace with a very strong portable wholesome snacks category in Mexico and stabilized our share in cookies in Brazil. Kellogg Latin America also recorded double-digit organic net sales growth in cereal as shown on Slide number 28. This growth was broad-based with good growth across each of our sub-regions. In market, category growth rates remain robust in the region, and our consumption has kept pace in Mexico and gained share in Brazil and Puerto Rico. So Latin America continues to perform well. And for the year, we continue to expect this region to sustain strong topline momentum. It will be led by snacks, but also by growth in cereal with both supported by strong innovation and relevant brand news. We also expect Latin America to improve its profit margins this year, and it plans to do all this while working on separating its Caribbean cereal business as part of the spin-off. So both of our emerging markets regions are showing current momentum to go with their outstanding long-term prospects. Now let's turn to our developed markets, starting with Kellogg Europe in Slide number 30. Here we continued to post strong 8% organic net sales growth in quarter one with organic growth across our categories, salty snacks, wholesome snacks and cereal. The Kellogg Europe net sales growth would have been in the double digits were it not for Russia, which we were in the process of divesting. Operating profit declined slightly year-on-year, but it was comparing against an unusually strong year earlier quarter. In addition, if we were to exclude the Russia business, Kellogg Europe's operating profit would have been up year-on-year in the high-single digits. So our underlying European business is performing very well. In snacks, which represents just over half of our sales in Kellogg Europe, we posted another strong quarter as shown on Slide number 31. In fact, the first quarter marked a seventh quarter in the last nine in which we have posted double-digit growth in our European snacks business. Specifically, our organic net sales growth accelerated sequentially in the first quarter to 14% year-on-year, and this growth would have been almost twice that if it were not for Russia. In market, Pringles has sustained its double-digit growth momentum, gaining share in the region led by the United Kingdom and France. And in portable wholesome snacks, we are experiencing double-digit consumption growth overall, and we have gained 2 full share points in the UK led by Rice Krispies Squares. Our cereal business in Europe also sustained growth in the first quarter, as shown on Slide number 32. The growth was slower than recent quarters, as we have seen rising price elasticity as well as intentional reduction of certain less profitable merchandising activities. Nevertheless, we continue to execute well in a challenging market. So when we look at the full-year for Kellogg Europe, we continue to expect the region to post another year of solid topline growth led by snacks. In fact, this should be a 6th consecutive year of organic net sales growth in our European snacks business. As mentioned previously, we are navigating through cost and supply pressures, which are particularly heavy in the first half, and we are in the process of divesting our Russia business, a transaction that is contingent on Russian government approval. And now we'll turn to Kellogg North America, beginning with Slide number 34. As you can see, it was a very strong quarter for Kellogg North America. We recorded organic net sales growth of 14% with price mix accelerating for a fourth consecutive quarter as we continued to implement revenue growth management actions in order to catch up with input cost inflation. This revenue growth management, along with productivity and diminishing bottlenecks and shortages, enabled an expansion in profit margins that drove operating profit up 21% year-on-year. Importantly, we again generated organic net sales growth in all three category groups during the first quarter. Slide number 35 shows how our largest category group snacks sustained its net sales momentum by growing 15% in the quarter. In market, Pringles well outpaced the U.S. salty snacks categories double-digit growth led by our multi-packs and our core four flavors. In Crackers, Cheez-It lapped an exceptionally strong year earlier quarter, but we did see double-digit consumption growth by our Club and Townhouse brands. And in portable wholesome snacks, our decision to discontinue various Kashi bars and the prioritization of capacity constrained Pop-Tarts SKUs, masked continued momentum in Rice Krispies Treats, and a resurgent Special K bars business. Our Frozen Foods business also grew net sales in the first quarter, as shown on Slide number 36. Here the growth has been more modest in part because of supply disruptions both in our Eggo frozen breakfast business and especially in our Morningstar Farms plant-based foods business. Meantime, both Eggo and Morningstar Farms are leading brands with strong commercial programs planned. So we are confident in our ability to improve our frozen performance as the year progresses. All of the regions and categories we've discussed up to now will be part of Kellanova and all of them are showing strong and continued net sales growth to go with progress toward recovering margins. Now we're going to turn to our North America cereal business, which forms the vast majority of what will be WK Kellogg Co. As shown on Slide number 37, this business continues to recover rapidly and posted another quarter of double-digit organic net sales growth. In the U.S., the cereal category grew at a double-digit rate in the quarter, and we gained nearly 3 points of share year-on-year as our resumed commercial activity is producing share gains across our portfolio led by Rice Krispies, Special K, Raisin Bran and Frosted Flakes. This recovery is evident in our U.S. away-from-home business as well. We gained several points of share across each of our major channels, convenience stores, food service and schools. And in Canada, where the restoration of inventory has come a bit more recently, our consumption growth was even more pronounced, and we gained roughly 6 points of share year-on-year. So the recovery continues in our North America cereal business. Turning to Slide number 38, our North America region is off to a strong start in 2023, giving us confidence in the full-year. Snacks is expected to sustain its momentum, while we have plans in place to improve our performance in frozen and our North America's cereal business continues its recovery. We are off to a good start on a margin recovery in North America, even as we reinvest in our brands. So the business is in good shape as we setup for the spin-off of WK Kellogg. So let me summarize on Slide number 40. We are off to a very strong start to this year. Around the world and across our key categories and brands, we have clearly sustained growth momentum and our profit margins impacted over the last 18 months by accelerated input cost inflation, economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages and even a fire and strike are starting to recover. These underlying trends with a strong first quarter already in the books are what give us increased confidence in a raised full-year outlook that had already called for sales and profit growth above our long-term targets. But while we are executing our plan and delivering on our current year results, we are also busy creating the future. This includes most notably our plan spin-off of our North America cereal business. We are full steam ahead on this work as we work through every detail of this important undertaking, we have become only more confident that this will create real value for our share owners. We will have a more focused WK Kellogg able to leverage its scale in North America cereal with a fit-for-purpose strategy, expertise and resource allocation, and we will have a greater visibility into a global snacking-oriented Kellanova that has been and will continue to be delivering above average financial performance. I couldn't be more proud of and grateful for our team members around the world who are executing with agility and passion emits in an external environment that remains incredibly dynamic. And with that, we'll open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We now begin the question-and-answer session with publishing analysts. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Question on gross spending. I would imagine this is the year that you're getting past a lot of supply chains, both supply chain issues both upstream and within the company. And I'm wondering, if you could just talk to where the biggest growth spending energy is being applied, whether that's advertising and promotion and innovation in areas of the world and parts of the business? Thanks.\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Thanks for the question, David. I want to make sure I understand the question. But in terms of reinvesting in the business, we are certainly investing in brand building. There's no question about that. We're investing in innovation and we're investing in capacity. And so we are obviously coming out of the pandemic and the supply disruptions, the bottlenecks and shortages as so many other companies are, and we're investing for growth. And you see that, you see that in our upgraded guidance for the topline, you see that in the better service levels that we're delivering to our customers, you see that in Pringles expansion around the world, which requires CapEx. And so it's really in those main areas. And again, if I understood the question, that's essentially where we're looking to deploy those resources.\nDavid Palmer: Yes. I mean, I guess, I'm just looking for examples and metrics with regard to the number of new products, the ability for you to get those things on the shelf and whether you're going to be layering in promotion spending as you go through this year, I think there's some concern that volumes in this space don't improve or don't hold up through the year as pricing rolls off. So these types of things can help people feel better about those volume metrics as you get later in the year.\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. I see, David. So I have heard some of the commentary around promotions and so forth, but brand building is up, innovation is up. And this notion that merchandising is returning to pre-pandemic levels. We're not quite there yet, but it's improving. And remember, merchandising, which some see is one element of the outcome of price promotion, get your product out on the floor, gets your consumers interrupted in their shopping patterns and we see it as a good thing. In terms of just going forward in innovation, the bar of innovation, I've said this in the past, has clearly gone up as SKU counts went down during the pandemic. So that's been raised. And we are very pleased with our topline performance. We're pleased with our ability to raise that guidance. And we're pleased with our margins where they are in the recovery in margins. So all that being said, I think the environment is a good environment. It's an environment that we're being successful in, we're being competitive in. And I think it's a positive environment as we look into the future.\nDavid Palmer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Andrew Lazar from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Steve, I guess I've got a bit of a higher-level sort of \u2013 hi there \u2013 a little bit of a higher level industry question for you. It looks as though we may finally be heading in earnest towards a more normal operating environment following three-plus years of all of the anomalous dynamics. And I guess I'm curious how you think this transition for the group to normalcy will look not just for Kellogg, but where the industry as a whole. I guess, in other words, do you think this transition to normalcy can be made in a somewhat orderly way? Or should investors have their expectations in check, maybe potentially for more uneven results for some time as pricing has lapped and perhaps it takes more time for volumes to pivot more positively. Basically, I'm just trying to assess whether we see more of like a hard or a soft landing, if you will, for food manufacturers as we kind of move into the more normal operating phase, if you will. Thanks so much.\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Thanks for the question, Andrew. I love some of the words you used in their normal and predictable and soft landing. Clearly, we've come through the last three-plus years in facing all these unprecedented challenges. We said as Kellogg that we would exit the pandemic a stronger company. And many of our competitors said the same thing, and we certainly have. And I think that puts us and the industry in a good position to actually come into this next kind of era, if you like, in a much stronger fashion without some of the disruptions and challenges that you alluded to. I mentioned to David in the earlier comment, the BARDA innovation has been raised. That is unquestionable. There is no question that innovations have to be better. They have to be performing right out of the gate. Shelf space is more valuable than it's ever been today in my years in the business, supply chains have had to become more agile. There's no question about that. Our supply chains have all been challenged to the degree they never have before. They've become more agile, but they've also used and utilized new technologies. We're deploying technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning. We're getting better and better at predictive really end-to-end. The relationships with our customers, I think, again, during the pandemic, it was about how do we serve our consumers, our joint consumers in ways that we never had to face before. We had all sorts of challenges with respect to that. But now supply chains have come through stronger as well and the relationships with consumers, I think, are more end-to-end than they've ever been before. And so looking to eliminate friction is something that we talk to our customers all the time about joint business plans start with how do you eliminate waste end to end, how do you grow the size of the prize, while we serve the common consumer. And I guess the final thing I'd say is the whole world of marketing has changed like it never has before. The true promise of one-to-one marketing that we've been talking about for so many years is upon us with data and analytics, more sophisticated than they've ever been, first-party data, more robust and more available than it's ever been to really target consumers in a way that marketers have dreamed up for years. And so you put all these things together, and it's not 1987 anymore. I think it is a really \u2013 it's not to be too rosy about it, but it's a new morning and it's, I think, a very, very promising outlook as we look towards how our industry and how Kellogg will perform in the future, we're very optimistic about the future for all of those reasons.\nAndrew Lazar: Really appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nBryan Spillane: All right. Terrific. Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Amit, I wanted to just ask a little bit about inflation. I'm not sure, I might have missed it, but did you give us an update on where cost of goods inflation was in the quarter and what you're expecting, I guess, for the balance of the year? And maybe if you can just give us a little bit of color on kind of what's moving in each direction. I think we're beginning to see some relief on like resins, some packaging costs. So just if you can just sort of unpack for us a little bit just kind of the COGS basket, where it stands and kind of what we should be looking at as we go forward.\nAmit Banati: Sure. So I think if you look at cost came in largely in line with expectations from a commodity standpoint. I think our outlook for the year continues to be mid-teens inflation. So no significant change than what we had talked in our last call. Certainly, there are some movement in some commodities. But like we've talked previously, we obviously have a hedging program. So some of that would flow through as hedges roll across. Very pleased with the performance in the first quarter. I mean if you look at our gross profit dollars, they were up 16% on a currency-neutral basis, so strong double-digit growth in our gross profit dollars. No question aided by the fire and strike in quarter one. But even if you look at it from a full-year standpoint, I think based on our quarter one performance, we are now saying that our gross profit dollars would be slightly ahead of our net sales growth. So we had talked previously of flattish gross margins for the year. I think based on what we're seeing right now, we expect our gross margins to be up slightly for the year.\nBryan Spillane: Okay, great. Thanks for that. And just as we're thinking about the flow of that, does the inflation moderate as the year goes on? Or is it pretty steady through the year?\nAmit Banati: I think the lap \u2013 I'd say, overall, it's in the mid-teens inflation. I think the lap would moderate in the second half because that's when we saw commodities kept going up last year. So you'll start lapping that in the second half. So the year-on-year moderation will certainly be more back half weighted.\nBryan Spillane: All right. Terrific. Thanks, Amit.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nKenneth Goldman: Hi. Thanks very much. I wanted to ask a quick question on LatAm. The volumes were down year-on-year. I think by the largest negative number in a few years. Obviously, a lot of that was to be expected given the pricing. But just sequentially, pricing wasn't up quite as much as 4Q, and the volume comp wasn't, I guess, that burdensome. So I'm just curious how you think about that particular region. Some of the tonnage numbers we're seeing there and how that relates to the previous questions about leaning into promotions a little bit more.\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Thanks, Ken. I'd start with overall very positively disposed to our results in Latin America. When you look at the disruption and you look at from a macroeconomic standpoint and all the things that are challenging in emerging markets in general, Latin America has been a pretty kind of steady place to be for the last several years up until about two years ago where we started to see a return to some of the macroeconomic challenges, the geopolitical challenges and so forth. So with that, we're very pleased with our performance. But we are seeing a rise in elasticity in Latin America. And that's no surprise. You see very high price increases to overcome the input cost inflation, and it's worsened by transactional ForEx over the past several quarters as well. It's been most pronounced in cereal, but we continue to perform well in cereal, in Mexico, especially big cereal business. And then when you look at our Pringles business in key markets, doing very well. Obviously, we added some capacity a couple of years ago in Brazil, put some lines of Pringles in. Pringles continues to perform very well in Latin America. So our outlook for Latin America remains strong, we're pleased with the performance there, but it's obviously an emerging market. So it comes with some volatility.\nKenneth Goldman: Great. Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nJason English: Hey. Good morning folks. Thanks for spot me in. The comment you made early, Steve about Cereal Co. or WK Kellogg Co. I think is what we're calling it, maybe not the Co at the end. But if that business effectively being stood up and running independently in the third quarter, it was interesting. How much functional overlap will there still be? And I guess what I'm kind of angling at here is it sounds like you may actually be. We're all breaking out about like how big the stranded cost and separation is going to be. What's the incremental cost nuggets could be? It sounds like you may actually be absorbing a lot of that in this year's guidance. Is that right? Thanks.\nJason English: That is right, Jason. That is in our guidance, the incremental cost of standing that up. We're doing something called company and company, which is essentially running water through the pipes so that we make sure that when we do spin-off the business, it's ready to go. And what I'd say in terms of stranded costs, trended margin, obviously, that's coming, but any kind of \u2013 the way you portray that, I would say, we're very confident, very confident in our ability to stand up these two companies with strong capital structures and very strong outlooks. And so I think many investors will be quite pleased when they see us come in the summer time during our Investor Day. We can't say much right now. But I'm very confident that those two businesses will be stood up, stood up strong with very strong outlooks. And I think you'll see the value creation and the value unlock will be an aha, aha moment for those who don't quite get it yet.\nJason English: Great. I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Alexia Howard from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nSteven Cahillane: Good morning, Alexia.\nAlexia Howard: Hi. I think you mentioned at the beginning of the prepared remarks that volume came through a little better than expected. I know it's still down, but it sounded though that was stronger. Can you give us a bit of color about where it was stronger? And do you expect that volume trajectory to improve as price growth flows through the course of the year? Or how much do you expect it to improve?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. Thanks, Alexia. I'll start, and Amit may want to add. And so volume was clearly better. And if you look at it compared to historical elasticities, it's better everywhere. There's no question about that. And that's not unexpected in a world where inflation is across the board, right? So it's all relative, and you have to think about the relativity of our categories versus more discretionary categories. Having said that, very good performance in North America relative to historical elasticities, very strong performance in EMEA relative to elasticities. I talked about Latin America, where we had elasticities rising a bit more, Europe, you see a lot of noise in there based on Russia and so forth, but a little bit more elasticity there. And so across the board, very good performance, standout performance in North America and EMEA relative to overperforming versus elasticities. When we think about the back half of the year, the remainder of the year, we are prudently assuming that elasticities start to increase and approach not quite historical levels, but on a march towards historical levels. And we think that's just a smart planning assumption. We'll see how it unfolds.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nStephen Powers: Great. Hey. Thanks, and good morning. I was actually going to ask a very similar question to the one that the Jason answer or asked. I think you answered that one pretty clearly. I guess the only thing I'd tack on to it maybe is you mentioned you cited that both Kellanova and WK Kellogg pro forma grew low-double digits in the quarter, and I realize you're constrained by giving us too much detail. But just given that disclosure, and I'm thinking about \u2013 as I think about the 6% to 7% full-year organic growth guide, is there any way you can frame us a little bit about how you expect those two businesses to be contributing to that 6% to 7% on the year so we can get a little sense of expected momentum as we go into the new regime. Thank you.\nAmit Banati: Yes. I'd say, Steve, we've got great momentum in both businesses. I think you've seen the results of Kellanova, good broad-based growth across all our categories, both in the U.S., internationally and across our categories as well. I think North America cereal, we're very pleased with the recovery that we are seeing there from a share standpoint, and that would continue to be the focus for the rest of the year. So there's good momentum across both the businesses.\nSteven Cahillane: Did we understand your question correctly, Steve?\nStephen Powers: Sorry, I was on mute. Yes. Thanks. I guess, if there's any way to provide a little bit of quantification around sort of the contribution of each of those businesses to that 6% to 7% on the year, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nAmit Banati: Yes. We don't have that, Steve. So I think what we'll do is probably in the Investor Day, we'll probably give you a lot more details of each of the two businesses. I mean, obviously, Kellanova is about 85%. So the 6% to 7% that we're talking for the overall companies being driven by Kellanova. And I think like on North America cereal, what you saw in the first quarter, we were clearly lapping the fire and strike. So the double-digit growth was lapping that. You'd expect that to normalize as we go through the course of the year.\nStephen Powers: Yes. Okay. Thank you.\nSteven Cahillane: Steve, maybe if it's helpful. As you look at syndicated data, you can look at the North American cereal business, and you see a lot there. And then as Amit said, 85% of the business is Kellanova. You look at the EMEA results, you look at the Europe and look at North America snacks, you can probably get a pretty good sense of what that looks like.\nStephen Powers: Yes. No, I think that's all fair. I was just looking to see if you had, if you, I get it. Thank you very much.\nSteven Cahillane: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question today comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nPamela Kaufman: Good morning.\nSteven Cahillane: Good morning.\nPamela Kaufman: Question on your EPS guidance for the year. Just given the magnitude of the Q1 beat, why not raise your full-year guidance by more than 1% were Q1 results more in line with your internal expectations versus where the street was? Or are there factors weighing on the EPS growth outlook over the rest of the year that temper the flow-through of Q1 upside?\nAmit Banati: Yes. I think like we talked earlier in the call and in the prepared remarks, obviously, very pleased with the Q1 over delivery. I think it's still early in the year. We talked a little bit about being prudent on our elasticity assumptions and price elasticity assumptions for the rest of the year. We're being prudent from a separation and spin standpoint, Steve talked a little bit about building into the guidance some of the costs associated with the spin in quarter three. So I think it's a balance of being prudent on our volume assumptions and our elasticity assumptions for the year. And it's early in the year, but obviously, very pleased with the underlying momentum in the business and the strong start.\nPamela Kaufman: Got it. Thank you. And then just on Europe, pricing came in very strong there, but volumes did soften \u2013 what are you seeing in terms of consumer behavior in Europe? And have you finalized your price negotiations there?\nSteven Cahillane: Yes, Pam. So what we're seeing in Europe is, as I mentioned earlier, a little bit more elasticity a little bit more channel shifting than we're seeing in some of the others. Obviously, a big impact on Russia, which obviously, we stopped shipping in Russia and we're divesting the business in Russia. But getting back to Continental Europe, shoppers are doing some channel shifting, as I just mentioned, hard discounters, clearly growing their businesses. That has a disproportionate benefit to private label. Within our portfolios, we're seeing a little bit more. And these are modest coming from small bases, but a little bit more private label growth in Europe, in Europe, cereal than we would be in the rest of the world. So no surprises. Europe is a challenging environment. But again, our results in that challenging environment are something that we're very proud of, very proud of the way the team has delivered. And as we said in our prepared remarks, when you strip out the effect of Russia, you see even better performance there. So one to watch, but one that we're \u2013 we've got very, very good plans in place for the back half of the year and even indeed into next year.\nPamela Kaufman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Max Gumport from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nMax Gumport: Hey. Thanks for the question. In the release and in the prepared remarks today, you discussed supply bottlenecks and shortages that are beginning to moderate. This has been a key pressure point for the industry, both in terms of supply chain disruptions we've seen and also inflation given conversion costs associated with upstream suppliers in particular. So I was hoping you could double-click on the drivers of the improvement that you're seeing there? And also how much recovery is still left to go? Thanks.\nSteven Cahillane: Yes. So Max, I'll start, and again, Amit can add. I'd say the easy answer \u2013 the short answer to that question is supply constraints, bottleneck shortages are improving almost everywhere. And so everything from the driver shortages that we talked about, the ocean freight shortages, containers being in the wrong place at the wrong time. All these things that only a year ago, the entire industry was struggling with had become much more normalized. We still have the odd shortages, inventory not being in the right place from some of our suppliers. But I mean literally, every day, it's getting better. We talked \u2013 I know a couple of times on these calls, about a control tower approach that we took and things that were elevated to the top of the control tower, if you like, that took manual interventions to get done, those are down dramatically. So the type of automation and the type of supply chain that we had before the pandemic is much closer to being real today than it was. We're not back to just-in-time inventories. We're not back to where we were. I don't think anybody is. But we're much closer and the outlook going forward continues to be one \u2013 definitely much more of optimism than what we saw up to this point. In the second half of the year, we see continued improvement.\nAmit Banati: The only thing I'd add is we're seeing that flow through into the P&L. And I think that was one of the drivers of the improved margin performance in quarter one. And certainly, the reason why we have confidence in raising our guidance for gross margin.\nMax Gumport: It's all great to hear. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Rob Dickerson from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nRobert Dickerson: Great. Thanks so much. Maybe just a quick question for you, Amit. Just around your \u2013 I guess, around Steve's comments, about kind of the potentially very attractive momentum in the two separate businesses. Remember, CAGNY, you kind of went through some incremental detail, I believe, in the TSA agreement. So excuse my ignorance here if everybody already knows this, but I was just kind of looking for kind of maybe a kind of a clarification how the TSA agreement actually works because my sense is kind of what I feel is the there's actually a payment to the Snacks Co. that provides you time to offset dis-synergies, if that makes sense. And maybe if you could just kind of clarify how that works? That's all I have. Thanks.\nAmit Banati: Yes. So we're making good progress on the TSAs of the transitionary service agreements across a number of areas, and we're putting those into place. I mean these TSAs cover areas like IT services, global shared services, transportation, logistics. So those will be the bulk of the transitionary service agreements. They are varying in nature and from a timing standpoint, but could extend up to two years. And obviously, that provides a stability, business continuity as well as helps offset the dis-synergies and gives both organizations time to address and put in place the right long-term structures appropriate for their businesses. So that's kind of where we are.\nRobert Dickerson: All right. Super. That's all. Thank you.\nJohn Renwick: Operator, we have time for one quick last question.\nOperator: Perfect. Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning. Just was wondering if you could elaborate\u2026\nSteven Cahillane: Good morning.\nMichael Lavery: Yes. Good morning. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little more on the restoration of marketing spending. And specifically, maybe if you're thinking of that in dollar terms or as a percent of sales, obviously, with pricing driven sales growth on a unit basis, the spend goes a little further if you do it as a percent of sales. Just curious where you land there and how to think about how that all evolves.\nAmit Banati: Yes. So we're pleased with the overall level of spending. And we'd expect it to be up, overall SG&A to be up similar to what it was up last year, low single-digit rates. I think within the year, obviously, there's a lot of phasing. If you recall, last year, we had pulled back in the first quarter. And then even in the second quarter, as we were restoring supply on the U.S. cereal business. This year, obviously, we've got a full commercial plan. And so I think in the quarter, we were up double-digit against a low base, I think you'll see that reverse out in the rest of the year. But overall, when you kind of look at it and if you put aside the noise of the lap of the fire and the strike, we're very pleased with the levels of investment. As Steve mentioned, we're investing across the world, both in our brands as well as in innovation, and we're pleased with the levels of spend that we have.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you.\nJohn Renwick: Operator, we are at 10:30. So if you don't mind, we'd have to close it out right now. But if anyone has any follow-up calls, please do not hesitate to call us.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Steven Cahillane",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to be able to report a very strong start to the year. In fact, it was stronger than we had anticipated and puts us in the enviable position of being able to raise our outlook for the full-year. Our topline growth momentum continues as shown on Slide number 5. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic net sales growth. And beneath the magnitude of our Q1 growth are promising trends. We continue to deliver above our long-term growth target. We continue to deliver broad-based growth across each of our four regions and across each of our four major category groups. Our soon-to-be Kellanova businesses continue to grow strongly, led by snacks in emerging markets, all paced by our highly differentiated world-class brands. Our soon-to-be WK Kellogg Co. businesses continue to show recovery in net sales, consumption and share. We have continued to execute revenue growth management actions across our businesses right through the first quarter in order to keep up with high input cost inflation and we have supported our growth with sustained innovation and with the supply improving, increased brand-building investment. So we feel very good about our topline growth momentum and outlook. We also feel good about restoring our profit margins. We said that this would be a year in which we stabilize and even improve our margins after being pressured the last couple of years by soaring input cost inflation, and inefficiencies in costs related to bottlenecks and shortages. The chart on Slide number 6 shows that margins are indeed stabilizing. In fact, better than expected margins are what drove most of the first quarter over-delivery versus our expectations. Aside from what we are lapping, what's behind us improving underlying margin performance is what gives us increased confidence in the full-year. Firstly, we continue to execute well on productivity initiatives and revenue growth management actions, both of which are starting to more fully catch up with our input cost inflation. Second, we continue to improve our service levels and the bottlenecks and shortages that had created so much disruption are finally receding. So while costs remain high, we are pleased with the quick and pace of our profit margin recovery. And it's not just the financials that are off to a good start in 2023, Kellogg's Better Days Promise, our social and environmental program continues to be a strategic priority for us. And as shown on Slide number 7, we were as active as ever in these areas during the first quarter. From actions visible in the marketplace, shown on the left-hand side of the page, the philanthropic and sustainability activities in the middle column, we continue to take an action-oriented approach. And the far right column shows that these actions continue to be recognized. We believe ESG is one of Kellogg Company's differentiating strengths and it will continue to be when we are Kellanova and WK Kellogg. And speaking of Kellanova and WK Kellogg, we are very pleased with how our spin-off work is progressing. Slide number 8 offers a high-level timeline of the work we are doing in order to be able to set up both companies for success, provide you with the strategic and financial information you need and execute the transaction. Everything is progressing well. The announcement of new company names has been well received by stakeholders. The organizational design work is finishing up with leadership team members already announced, and the remainder of talent placements coming later in the second quarter. The design and setup of systems and processes for WK Kellogg is underway and various post-spin transition services continue to be ironed out. Prior year carve out financials are being prepared and we expect to have them audited in the next couple of months. During the third quarter, we plan to test run WK Kellogg on its own from procurement to manufacturing, to invoicing to financials. And best of all, employee sentiment and engagement remain very high. We expect to be able to provide you with information via a Form 10 sometime in late summer, followed by an investor event, likely in late third quarter, during which we will be able to share with you the strategies, capital structures, and financial outlooks for both companies. That will all lead to the transaction, which takes place in the fourth quarter. Again, some of this is dependent on timing of regulatory and other customary approvals, but it should give you assurance that the information and transaction are not far away. And most importantly, all of this preparation work has only strengthened our convection that this spin-off creates value for share owners. We are setting up both companies for success. WK Kellogg Co. will benefit from focus and resource prioritization and Kellanova will be a higher growth company with 80% of sales coming from snacks in emerging markets. Now let me turn it over to Amit, who will provide you the financial details of our first quarter and full-year outlook. Thanks, Amit. We'll organize our discussion around the businesses that will comprise Kellanova and WK Kellogg. Slide number 20 reminds you of the composition of the two businesses. And on the slide, you can see how our topline momentum in quarter one continue to span across our portfolio with both Kellanova and WK Kellogg posting double-digit organic net sales growth. Clearly, we are heading into the spin-off with good momentum. Let's start by discussing the Kellanova businesses leading off with our emerging markets regions. Slide number 21 shows the financial performance of our EMEA region. As you can see, this region sustained its exceptional momentum in the first quarter, posting a third consecutive quarter of organic net sales growth of at least 20%. And equally impressive, it expanded its operating profit margin and accelerated its operating profit growth to 21% year-on-year, and all this in spite of exceedingly high cost inflation and reinvestment into the business. Let's break the region down into key category groups, starting with snacks on Slide number 22. EMEA snacks posted yet another quarter of explosive topline growth in the first quarter, growing net sales at an organic rate of 26% year-on-year. This growth was broad-based across all of our major sub-regions, and it was led by its biggest brand Pringles. In market, Pringles continues to significantly outpace the high-teens growth of the salty snacks category in the region with notable growth and share gains in markets like Australia, Korea, Japan and Thailand. EMEA cereal also sustained strong momentum. As shown on Slide number 23, this business delivered double-digit organic net sales growth again in the first quarter. And this growth was broad-based with growth across each of our major sub regions, Asia, Australia, Africa and the Middle East, North Africa, Turkey region. In market, we have outpaced the cereal categories mid single-digit consumption growth in the region, which brings us to noodles and other in Slide number 24. Led by Multipro in Nigeria, this business continued to deliver organic net sales growth in excess of 20% in the first quarter. Even amidst high inflation and a currency demonetization initiative, Multipro continued to thrive, clear evidence of its competitive advantage and experienced management team. Meanwhile, we continue to expand our Kellogg Noodles business outside of Nigeria. So clearly, Kellogg EMEA is firing on all cylinders. For the full-year, we continue to expect sustained momentum across all three category groups, delivering yet another year of organic net sales growth, all while improving our profit margins. Now let's discuss Latin America, starting on Slide number 26. Kellogg Latin America in the first quarter delivered another quarter of double-digit organic net sales growth. This growth was led by Mexico, but we also saw strong growth in Brazil and our Central America and Caribbean sub-region. We expanded our operating margin in the first quarter, helping to grow our operating profit by 20% year-on-year, albeit lapping notably high cost in the year earlier quarter. Our snacks business in Latin America continued to deliver double-digit organic net sales growth as shown on Slide number 27. This growth was led by Pringles with notably strong growth in Mexico and Brazil. In market, the salty snacks category sustained double-digit growth in those two markets, and Pringles gained share in both. We also have kept pace with a very strong portable wholesome snacks category in Mexico and stabilized our share in cookies in Brazil. Kellogg Latin America also recorded double-digit organic net sales growth in cereal as shown on Slide number 28. This growth was broad-based with good growth across each of our sub-regions. In market, category growth rates remain robust in the region, and our consumption has kept pace in Mexico and gained share in Brazil and Puerto Rico. So Latin America continues to perform well. And for the year, we continue to expect this region to sustain strong topline momentum. It will be led by snacks, but also by growth in cereal with both supported by strong innovation and relevant brand news. We also expect Latin America to improve its profit margins this year, and it plans to do all this while working on separating its Caribbean cereal business as part of the spin-off. So both of our emerging markets regions are showing current momentum to go with their outstanding long-term prospects. Now let's turn to our developed markets, starting with Kellogg Europe in Slide number 30. Here we continued to post strong 8% organic net sales growth in quarter one with organic growth across our categories, salty snacks, wholesome snacks and cereal. The Kellogg Europe net sales growth would have been in the double digits were it not for Russia, which we were in the process of divesting. Operating profit declined slightly year-on-year, but it was comparing against an unusually strong year earlier quarter. In addition, if we were to exclude the Russia business, Kellogg Europe's operating profit would have been up year-on-year in the high-single digits. So our underlying European business is performing very well. In snacks, which represents just over half of our sales in Kellogg Europe, we posted another strong quarter as shown on Slide number 31. In fact, the first quarter marked a seventh quarter in the last nine in which we have posted double-digit growth in our European snacks business. Specifically, our organic net sales growth accelerated sequentially in the first quarter to 14% year-on-year, and this growth would have been almost twice that if it were not for Russia. In market, Pringles has sustained its double-digit growth momentum, gaining share in the region led by the United Kingdom and France. And in portable wholesome snacks, we are experiencing double-digit consumption growth overall, and we have gained 2 full share points in the UK led by Rice Krispies Squares. Our cereal business in Europe also sustained growth in the first quarter, as shown on Slide number 32. The growth was slower than recent quarters, as we have seen rising price elasticity as well as intentional reduction of certain less profitable merchandising activities. Nevertheless, we continue to execute well in a challenging market. So when we look at the full-year for Kellogg Europe, we continue to expect the region to post another year of solid topline growth led by snacks. In fact, this should be a 6th consecutive year of organic net sales growth in our European snacks business. As mentioned previously, we are navigating through cost and supply pressures, which are particularly heavy in the first half, and we are in the process of divesting our Russia business, a transaction that is contingent on Russian government approval. And now we'll turn to Kellogg North America, beginning with Slide number 34. As you can see, it was a very strong quarter for Kellogg North America. We recorded organic net sales growth of 14% with price mix accelerating for a fourth consecutive quarter as we continued to implement revenue growth management actions in order to catch up with input cost inflation. This revenue growth management, along with productivity and diminishing bottlenecks and shortages, enabled an expansion in profit margins that drove operating profit up 21% year-on-year. Importantly, we again generated organic net sales growth in all three category groups during the first quarter. Slide number 35 shows how our largest category group snacks sustained its net sales momentum by growing 15% in the quarter. In market, Pringles well outpaced the U.S. salty snacks categories double-digit growth led by our multi-packs and our core four flavors. In Crackers, Cheez-It lapped an exceptionally strong year earlier quarter, but we did see double-digit consumption growth by our Club and Townhouse brands. And in portable wholesome snacks, our decision to discontinue various Kashi bars and the prioritization of capacity constrained Pop-Tarts SKUs, masked continued momentum in Rice Krispies Treats, and a resurgent Special K bars business. Our Frozen Foods business also grew net sales in the first quarter, as shown on Slide number 36. Here the growth has been more modest in part because of supply disruptions both in our Eggo frozen breakfast business and especially in our Morningstar Farms plant-based foods business. Meantime, both Eggo and Morningstar Farms are leading brands with strong commercial programs planned. So we are confident in our ability to improve our frozen performance as the year progresses. All of the regions and categories we've discussed up to now will be part of Kellanova and all of them are showing strong and continued net sales growth to go with progress toward recovering margins. Now we're going to turn to our North America cereal business, which forms the vast majority of what will be WK Kellogg Co. As shown on Slide number 37, this business continues to recover rapidly and posted another quarter of double-digit organic net sales growth. In the U.S., the cereal category grew at a double-digit rate in the quarter, and we gained nearly 3 points of share year-on-year as our resumed commercial activity is producing share gains across our portfolio led by Rice Krispies, Special K, Raisin Bran and Frosted Flakes. This recovery is evident in our U.S. away-from-home business as well. We gained several points of share across each of our major channels, convenience stores, food service and schools. And in Canada, where the restoration of inventory has come a bit more recently, our consumption growth was even more pronounced, and we gained roughly 6 points of share year-on-year. So the recovery continues in our North America cereal business. Turning to Slide number 38, our North America region is off to a strong start in 2023, giving us confidence in the full-year. Snacks is expected to sustain its momentum, while we have plans in place to improve our performance in frozen and our North America's cereal business continues its recovery. We are off to a good start on a margin recovery in North America, even as we reinvest in our brands. So the business is in good shape as we setup for the spin-off of WK Kellogg. So let me summarize on Slide number 40. We are off to a very strong start to this year. Around the world and across our key categories and brands, we have clearly sustained growth momentum and our profit margins impacted over the last 18 months by accelerated input cost inflation, economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages and even a fire and strike are starting to recover. These underlying trends with a strong first quarter already in the books are what give us increased confidence in a raised full-year outlook that had already called for sales and profit growth above our long-term targets. But while we are executing our plan and delivering on our current year results, we are also busy creating the future. This includes most notably our plan spin-off of our North America cereal business. We are full steam ahead on this work as we work through every detail of this important undertaking, we have become only more confident that this will create real value for our share owners. We will have a more focused WK Kellogg able to leverage its scale in North America cereal with a fit-for-purpose strategy, expertise and resource allocation, and we will have a greater visibility into a global snacking-oriented Kellanova that has been and will continue to be delivering above average financial performance. I couldn't be more proud of and grateful for our team members around the world who are executing with agility and passion emits in an external environment that remains incredibly dynamic. And with that, we'll open up the line for questions. Yes. Thanks for the question, David. I want to make sure I understand the question. But in terms of reinvesting in the business, we are certainly investing in brand building. There's no question about that. We're investing in innovation and we're investing in capacity. And so we are obviously coming out of the pandemic and the supply disruptions, the bottlenecks and shortages as so many other companies are, and we're investing for growth. And you see that, you see that in our upgraded guidance for the topline, you see that in the better service levels that we're delivering to our customers, you see that in Pringles expansion around the world, which requires CapEx. And so it's really in those main areas. And again, if I understood the question, that's essentially where we're looking to deploy those resources. Yes. I see, David. So I have heard some of the commentary around promotions and so forth, but brand building is up, innovation is up. And this notion that merchandising is returning to pre-pandemic levels. We're not quite there yet, but it's improving. And remember, merchandising, which some see is one element of the outcome of price promotion, get your product out on the floor, gets your consumers interrupted in their shopping patterns and we see it as a good thing. In terms of just going forward in innovation, the bar of innovation, I've said this in the past, has clearly gone up as SKU counts went down during the pandemic. So that's been raised. And we are very pleased with our topline performance. We're pleased with our ability to raise that guidance. And we're pleased with our margins where they are in the recovery in margins. So all that being said, I think the environment is a good environment. It's an environment that we're being successful in, we're being competitive in. And I think it's a positive environment as we look into the future. Yes. Thanks for the question, Andrew. I love some of the words you used in their normal and predictable and soft landing. Clearly, we've come through the last three-plus years in facing all these unprecedented challenges. We said as Kellogg that we would exit the pandemic a stronger company. And many of our competitors said the same thing, and we certainly have. And I think that puts us and the industry in a good position to actually come into this next kind of era, if you like, in a much stronger fashion without some of the disruptions and challenges that you alluded to. I mentioned to David in the earlier comment, the BARDA innovation has been raised. That is unquestionable. There is no question that innovations have to be better. They have to be performing right out of the gate. Shelf space is more valuable than it's ever been today in my years in the business, supply chains have had to become more agile. There's no question about that. Our supply chains have all been challenged to the degree they never have before. They've become more agile, but they've also used and utilized new technologies. We're deploying technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning. We're getting better and better at predictive really end-to-end. The relationships with our customers, I think, again, during the pandemic, it was about how do we serve our consumers, our joint consumers in ways that we never had to face before. We had all sorts of challenges with respect to that. But now supply chains have come through stronger as well and the relationships with consumers, I think, are more end-to-end than they've ever been before. And so looking to eliminate friction is something that we talk to our customers all the time about joint business plans start with how do you eliminate waste end to end, how do you grow the size of the prize, while we serve the common consumer. And I guess the final thing I'd say is the whole world of marketing has changed like it never has before. The true promise of one-to-one marketing that we've been talking about for so many years is upon us with data and analytics, more sophisticated than they've ever been, first-party data, more robust and more available than it's ever been to really target consumers in a way that marketers have dreamed up for years. And so you put all these things together, and it's not 1987 anymore. I think it is a really \u2013 it's not to be too rosy about it, but it's a new morning and it's, I think, a very, very promising outlook as we look towards how our industry and how Kellogg will perform in the future, we're very optimistic about the future for all of those reasons. Yes. Thanks, Ken. I'd start with overall very positively disposed to our results in Latin America. When you look at the disruption and you look at from a macroeconomic standpoint and all the things that are challenging in emerging markets in general, Latin America has been a pretty kind of steady place to be for the last several years up until about two years ago where we started to see a return to some of the macroeconomic challenges, the geopolitical challenges and so forth. So with that, we're very pleased with our performance. But we are seeing a rise in elasticity in Latin America. And that's no surprise. You see very high price increases to overcome the input cost inflation, and it's worsened by transactional ForEx over the past several quarters as well. It's been most pronounced in cereal, but we continue to perform well in cereal, in Mexico, especially big cereal business. And then when you look at our Pringles business in key markets, doing very well. Obviously, we added some capacity a couple of years ago in Brazil, put some lines of Pringles in. Pringles continues to perform very well in Latin America. So our outlook for Latin America remains strong, we're pleased with the performance there, but it's obviously an emerging market. So it comes with some volatility. Good morning, Alexia. Yes. Thanks, Alexia. I'll start, and Amit may want to add. And so volume was clearly better. And if you look at it compared to historical elasticities, it's better everywhere. There's no question about that. And that's not unexpected in a world where inflation is across the board, right? So it's all relative, and you have to think about the relativity of our categories versus more discretionary categories. Having said that, very good performance in North America relative to historical elasticities, very strong performance in EMEA relative to elasticities. I talked about Latin America, where we had elasticities rising a bit more, Europe, you see a lot of noise in there based on Russia and so forth, but a little bit more elasticity there. And so across the board, very good performance, standout performance in North America and EMEA relative to overperforming versus elasticities. When we think about the back half of the year, the remainder of the year, we are prudently assuming that elasticities start to increase and approach not quite historical levels, but on a march towards historical levels. And we think that's just a smart planning assumption. We'll see how it unfolds. Did we understand your question correctly, Steve? Steve, maybe if it's helpful. As you look at syndicated data, you can look at the North American cereal business, and you see a lot there. And then as Amit said, 85% of the business is Kellanova. You look at the EMEA results, you look at the Europe and look at North America snacks, you can probably get a pretty good sense of what that looks like. You bet. Good morning. Yes, Pam. So what we're seeing in Europe is, as I mentioned earlier, a little bit more elasticity a little bit more channel shifting than we're seeing in some of the others. Obviously, a big impact on Russia, which obviously, we stopped shipping in Russia and we're divesting the business in Russia. But getting back to Continental Europe, shoppers are doing some channel shifting, as I just mentioned, hard discounters, clearly growing their businesses. That has a disproportionate benefit to private label. Within our portfolios, we're seeing a little bit more. And these are modest coming from small bases, but a little bit more private label growth in Europe, in Europe, cereal than we would be in the rest of the world. So no surprises. Europe is a challenging environment. But again, our results in that challenging environment are something that we're very proud of, very proud of the way the team has delivered. And as we said in our prepared remarks, when you strip out the effect of Russia, you see even better performance there. So one to watch, but one that we're \u2013 we've got very, very good plans in place for the back half of the year and even indeed into next year. Yes. So Max, I'll start, and again, Amit can add. I'd say the easy answer \u2013 the short answer to that question is supply constraints, bottleneck shortages are improving almost everywhere. And so everything from the driver shortages that we talked about, the ocean freight shortages, containers being in the wrong place at the wrong time. All these things that only a year ago, the entire industry was struggling with had become much more normalized. We still have the odd shortages, inventory not being in the right place from some of our suppliers. But I mean literally, every day, it's getting better. We talked \u2013 I know a couple of times on these calls, about a control tower approach that we took and things that were elevated to the top of the control tower, if you like, that took manual interventions to get done, those are down dramatically. So the type of automation and the type of supply chain that we had before the pandemic is much closer to being real today than it was. We're not back to just-in-time inventories. We're not back to where we were. I don't think anybody is. But we're much closer and the outlook going forward continues to be one \u2013 definitely much more of optimism than what we saw up to this point. In the second half of the year, we see continued improvement. Good morning."

            "name": "Amit Banati",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide number 10, provides a summary of our first quarter financial results. Obviously, it was a very strong start to the year. Our 14% organic net sales growth was driven by sustained growth in price and mix. Net sales were better than expected principally because of volume. As Steve mentioned, we also performed better on profit margins than we had expected, leading to a very strong 18% increase in adjusted operating profit on a currency-neutral basis. This higher operating profit drove adjusted earnings per share to be 3% higher than last year on a currency-neutral basis. Remember, this growth is in spite of significant macro-related headwinds on our below the line items. In fact, higher interest expense and lower pension accounting income pulled EPS down by about 5 and 8 percentage points respectively, year-on-year in the quarter. Cash flow in the first three months decreased year-on-year as expected. This is related to the payout of 2022s incentive compensation in quarter one, cash outlets related to their spin-off and the timing of certain working capital items and capital expenditure. Now let's look at each metric in a little more detail. Slide number 11 lays out the components of our strong net sales growth in quarter one. Price mix growth was sustained in the mid-teens, reflecting revenue growth management initiatives around the world, which we implemented during 2022 and right through quarter one 2023 as we continue to work to offset high input cost inflation. Volume declined reflecting price elasticity, though not as much as we had expected for quarter one. Foreign currency translation reduced net sales by about 3 points, reflecting the stronger U.S. dollar against key currencies versus the prior year. As we will discuss in a moment, we are raising our organic net sales guidance for the year. Our outlook continues to prudently assume that price elasticities will sustain their upward move towards historical levels, and depending on the direction of input cost inflation that price mix will begin to lap last year's sizable revenue growth management actions. Nonetheless, there is no question that posting better than expected growth yet again in quarter one indicates strong underlying momentum in our business, giving us good confidence in our outlook. Next, let's review our gross profit performance on Slide number 12. As we've discussed numerous times, our objective in this high inflation environment has been to protect gross profit dollars via productivity savings and revenue growth management. As you can see on the chart, we have done a good job at this even considering the large and transitory impact in quarter four, 2021 and quarter one, 2022 of a fire and strike. And we've done this in spite of economy-wide bottlenecks and shortages, which have created significant inefficiencies and incremental costs. In the first quarter, we made our most progress yet. Productivity and revenue growth management continued to catch up to a high market-driven input cost inflation. Bottlenecks and shortages did diminish in the quarter a little sooner than we had projected. We did lap a negative residual impact from the fire and strike, but even excluding that estimated impact from last year, our gross profit dollars increased year-on-year. We also improved gross profit on a percentage margin basis as we lap the fire and strike and narrowed our underlying margin decline by more than we expected. Our plan was always to have a better second half than first half due to gradually improving supply conditions and the lapping of accelerated input cost inflation. This quarter one performance gives us that much more confidence that we can finish the year better than the flattish margin we had discussed previously. Slide number 13 depicts our SG&A expense, whose quarterly year-on-year changes this year are greatly affected by year-ago comparisons. As expected, our SG&A in this year's quarter one increased at a double-digit rate year-on-year as we lap in unusual decline in the year earlier period. That was when brand building had been pulled back because of supply disruptions, most notably during North America cereals inventory rebuild and as we lapped overhead, that was low because of low travel and meetings during the pandemic. As you can see on the slide, we start to lap a resumption of brand building and travel and meetings in quarter two, but it was really the second half last year when we move toward full restoration of both and also raised our incentive compensation accruals. But in absolute numbers, we feel good about our levels of investment in brands and capabilities and we remain on track for the full-year. Moving to Slide number 14, we can see that our growth in net sales and gross profit were more than enough to cover this year-on-year rise in SG&A expense, resulting in our 18% currency-neutral growth in adjusted basis operating profit. This is a fourth straight quarter of solid year-on-year growth. Importantly, we have sustained a multi-year upward trajectory on operating profit. Even excluding from the year earlier quarter, an estimated impact of the fire and strike, we continued to grow our dollars year-on-year in quarter one. In fact, our quarter one operating profit was higher than previous years quarter one operating profit as well, even dating back to prior to the Keebler divestiture. So obviously a strong start to the year and this gives us the confidence to raise our full-year guidance. Moving down the income statements, Slide number 15 shows that our operating profit growth was more than enough to offset what were severe headwinds within our below the line items. These below the line pressures were expected and will continue through the year. Interest expense increased significantly year-on-year due to higher interest rates. In dollars, we should see something close to this in each of the remaining three quarters of the year. Other income decreased sharply year-on-year, reflecting accounting of pension and post-retirement plan asset values and interest rates stemming from last year's decline in financial markets. Because of some favorability in some other items in this line, this quarter one figure is probably a little higher than what we will see in the remaining quarters. Our effective tax rate came in a little higher than expected, largely due to country mix and some other differences, and it was a little above a tax rate of about 22%. Average shares outstanding were up slightly year-on-year and we would expect that to be the case for the full-year as well. In addition, foreign currency translation was a headwind of a little more than 2%, believe foreign currency translation out of our guidance because it is out of our control and difficult to predict, but today's exchange rates would suggest a sequentially smaller impact in each remaining quarter, finishing the year with a negative impact of 1% to 2%. So while these below the line items are weighing down EPS as expected, it is important to remember that the operational side of our P&L through operating profit is very strong. Now let's turn to our cash flow and balance sheet and Slide number 16. As I mentioned earlier, our cash flow in quarter one was lower than last year's as we had expected. In addition to lapping a particularly strong year-ago period, this quarter, we experienced the payout of 2022s incentive compensation as well as incremental cash outlays related to the spin-off. Cash flow was also impacted year-on-year by timing of working capital and capital expenditure. We remain on track for our full-year guidance. Meanwhile, our net debt has been trending lower, contributing to our strong financial flexibility. So let's now summarize our guidance on Slide number 17. Keep in mind that while we expect the spin-off to be transacted during quarter four, our guidance assumes it takes place at year-end purely for simplicity reasons. Similarly, while the divestiture of our Russian business awaits government approval, our guidance assumes it remains in our portfolio for the full-year and the divestiture impact will be immaterial to adjusted basis EPS. We are raising our guidance for organic net sales growth to 6% to 7%, reflecting our better than expected performance in quarter one, which continue to demonstrate price realization and solid momentum across our portfolio. We maintained our assumption for decelerating growth as the year progresses, which reflects a likely return of elasticity towards historical levels as well as lapping a particularly substantial revenue growth management actions in the second half of last year. This 6% to 7% organic growth is well above our long-term target. We are raising our guidance for adjusted operating profit growth to 8% to 10% on a currency-neutral basis. This percentage point increase to the range reflects our stronger than expected quarter one. We feel increasingly confident in our ability to improve margins this year, which combined with our above target net sales growth will deliver operating profit growth that is also above our long-term target. Based on that improved operating profit outlook, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance as well, now looking for a year-on-year decline of 1% to 3%. Remember that this decline is more than explained by the year-on-year reduction in pension and post-retirement income, a non-operating non-cash item that is expected to have a negative impact of nearly 7 percentage points on EPS this year. The negative impact of higher interest expense due to higher interest rates in the economy is another 4% plus. If it weren't for those two macro-related impacts, our guidance for EPS would be well above our long-term growth target. Our guidance for cash flow remains at $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Recall that within this guidance, we are expecting a year-on-year increase in our underlying cash flow, offset by one-time cash costs and capital related to the spin-off. So to summarize our financial position, sustained price realization continue to generate strong topline growth around the world and across our category groups. We like how our businesses are performing and we have confidence in our full-year sales outlook. Productivity and revenue growth management actions, along with diminishing bottlenecks and shortages and improving service levels have gotten us off to a good start towards improving our profit margins. Our financial flexibility is strong, marked by a solid balance sheet and cash flow that remains in good shape, even with some adverse timing in the first three months. Our guidance for 2023 has moved higher, continuing to expect net sales growth and operating profit growth that are above our long-term targets. The fast start of quarter one gives us that much more confidence in this full-year outlook, even giving us some flexibility relative to readying ourselves for the spin-off. We continue to make good progress on setting up both Kellanova and WK Kellogg for financial success. In addition to carving out of their financials, we are managing upfront expenditures, minimizing standalone costs for WK Kellogg and stranded margin for Kellanova, and we are ensuring solid capital structures and financial flexibility for both. And with that, I'll turn it back to Steve to walk you through our individual businesses. Sure. So I think if you look at cost came in largely in line with expectations from a commodity standpoint. I think our outlook for the year continues to be mid-teens inflation. So no significant change than what we had talked in our last call. Certainly, there are some movement in some commodities. But like we've talked previously, we obviously have a hedging program. So some of that would flow through as hedges roll across. Very pleased with the performance in the first quarter. I mean if you look at our gross profit dollars, they were up 16% on a currency-neutral basis, so strong double-digit growth in our gross profit dollars. No question aided by the fire and strike in quarter one. But even if you look at it from a full-year standpoint, I think based on our quarter one performance, we are now saying that our gross profit dollars would be slightly ahead of our net sales growth. So we had talked previously of flattish gross margins for the year. I think based on what we're seeing right now, we expect our gross margins to be up slightly for the year. I think the lap \u2013 I'd say, overall, it's in the mid-teens inflation. I think the lap would moderate in the second half because that's when we saw commodities kept going up last year. So you'll start lapping that in the second half. So the year-on-year moderation will certainly be more back half weighted. Yes. I'd say, Steve, we've got great momentum in both businesses. I think you've seen the results of Kellanova, good broad-based growth across all our categories, both in the U.S., internationally and across our categories as well. I think North America cereal, we're very pleased with the recovery that we are seeing there from a share standpoint, and that would continue to be the focus for the rest of the year. So there's good momentum across both the businesses. Yes. We don't have that, Steve. So I think what we'll do is probably in the Investor Day, we'll probably give you a lot more details of each of the two businesses. I mean, obviously, Kellanova is about 85%. So the 6% to 7% that we're talking for the overall companies being driven by Kellanova. And I think like on North America cereal, what you saw in the first quarter, we were clearly lapping the fire and strike. So the double-digit growth was lapping that. You'd expect that to normalize as we go through the course of the year. Yes. I think like we talked earlier in the call and in the prepared remarks, obviously, very pleased with the Q1 over delivery. I think it's still early in the year. We talked a little bit about being prudent on our elasticity assumptions and price elasticity assumptions for the rest of the year. We're being prudent from a separation and spin standpoint, Steve talked a little bit about building into the guidance some of the costs associated with the spin in quarter three. So I think it's a balance of being prudent on our volume assumptions and our elasticity assumptions for the year. And it's early in the year, but obviously, very pleased with the underlying momentum in the business and the strong start. The only thing I'd add is we're seeing that flow through into the P&L. And I think that was one of the drivers of the improved margin performance in quarter one. And certainly, the reason why we have confidence in raising our guidance for gross margin. Yes. So we're making good progress on the TSAs of the transitionary service agreements across a number of areas, and we're putting those into place. I mean these TSAs cover areas like IT services, global shared services, transportation, logistics. So those will be the bulk of the transitionary service agreements. They are varying in nature and from a timing standpoint, but could extend up to two years. And obviously, that provides a stability, business continuity as well as helps offset the dis-synergies and gives both organizations time to address and put in place the right long-term structures appropriate for their businesses. So that's kind of where we are. Yes. So we're pleased with the overall level of spending. And we'd expect it to be up, overall SG&A to be up similar to what it was up last year, low single-digit rates. I think within the year, obviously, there's a lot of phasing. If you recall, last year, we had pulled back in the first quarter. And then even in the second quarter, as we were restoring supply on the U.S. cereal business. This year, obviously, we've got a full commercial plan. And so I think in the quarter, we were up double-digit against a low base, I think you'll see that reverse out in the rest of the year. But overall, when you kind of look at it and if you put aside the noise of the lap of the fire and the strike, we're very pleased with the levels of investment. As Steve mentioned, we're investing across the world, both in our brands as well as in innovation, and we're pleased with the levels of spend that we have."

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for Kellanova. Mr. Renwick, you may begin your conference call.\nJohn Renwick: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for a review of our second quarter results as well as an update on our outlook for 2024. I am joined this morning by Steve Cahillane, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Amit Banati, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. Slide number 3 shows our forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware, certain statements made today, such as projections for Kellanova's future performance are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the third slide of this presentation as well as to our public SEC filings. A recording of today's webcast and supporting documents will be archived for at least 90 days on the Investor page of www.kellanova.com. As always, when referring to our results and outlook, unless otherwise noted, we will be referring to them on an organic basis for net sales and on a currency-neutral adjusted basis for operating profit and earnings per share. Also, remember that our 2023 results have been recast to treat the spun off W.K. Kellogg Co. as a discontinued operation in accordance with applicable accounting guidelines. Those recast statements can be found in our Q4 2023 earnings press release from February 8 of this year. And now I'll turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Cahillane: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We're once again pleased to report strong quarterly results that are clear evidence of our more growth-oriented and more profitable portfolio following last fall's spin-off. Our year-on-year organic growth in net sales was again on algorithm and volume trends improved sequentially again outside of Nigeria. Our year-on-year currency neutral operating profit growth was also on algorithm, and we continue to improve our profit margins. And we've returned to full commercial activity with our stepped-up innovation reaching shelves in the second quarter. Delighting consumers is never more important than it is right now, and we now have our full plan in the marketplace, which should help us continue to improve our end-market performance in the second half. On Slide number 6, we remind you of our strategy, differentiate, drive and deliver, which we continue to execute, helping us to deliver our near-term commitments, but also to build for a strong future and drive shareowner value. On Slide number 7, we remind you of our global footprint, diversification and exposure to faster-growing markets is a true point of differentiation for Kellanova. This differentiated footprint, along with our return to full commercial activity around the world, contributed to our continued sequential improvement in volume in most of our regions. The chart on Slide number 8 excludes our joint ventures in Africa where currency-driven price increases in Nigeria have resulted in recent elasticities as we expected. We see that our businesses outside those JVs posted a fourth consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in volume. And we drove the sequential improvement across our regions. Europe and the rest of EMEA both recorded moderating volume declines and North America and Latin America both returned to outright volume growth. Another key driver is shown on Slide number 9, innovation. As discussed previously, we are returning to a full innovation launch calendar after the pandemic era supply disruptions. As you can see on the slide, we have a plethora of innovations launching across every one regions this year, ranging from limited additions to new flavors to amplified wellness credentials, to entirely new food platforms. I'll just highlight a few notables. In the second half, we will be launching Pringles Mingles in North America, our first out-of-the-can launch in the United States in over 15 years. In late Q3, we will be introducing Cheez-It to Europe with a big launch in the UK supported by a full arsenal of sampling, social media and public relations and advertising. We've innovated in away-from-home channels as well, sometimes leveraging these channels to drive consumer awareness. A good example is our partnering with Taco Bell to launch a bit Cheez-It Crunchwrap Supreme and a big Cheez-It Tostada. So we feel very good about the quality of our innovations and the buzz, trial and incremental purchases they will generate. Indeed, this heavy innovation calendar should bring us back to normal levels of net sales contribution from innovation, Slide number 10 measures year one incremental sales from innovation launches expressed as a percent of our total net sales. Notice how the incremental net sales we expect to generate from this year's innovation launches are much higher than the last couple of years when we have been contending with global supply disruptions. Getting back to delighting consumers through innovation is a key component of what we refer to as getting back to full commercial activity. Another good sign is shown on slide number 11. In our return to full commercial activity, we obviously prioritized our biggest brand, Pringles. The chart shows how this investment and activity is improving our net sales growth and in-market performance for this highly differentiated brand. All of it led to another quarter of differentiated results, starting with organic net sales growth. Slide number 12 shows how we continue to well outpace the median growth of our peer group, including our more directly comparable snacking and international peers. This is precisely the greater growth orientation I mentioned earlier about our strategy and portfolio. Now, let's talk about how we are a more profitable company than we were previously. Slide number 13 shows how our year-to-date gross profit margin and operating profit margin this year as Kellanova are meaningfully higher than the same periods pre-pandemic and pre-spin-off. And our improvement in margins continued the second quarter as Amit will discuss in a moment, even with a substantial increase in brand investment. Improving our margins is an important part of our strategy as they fuel our ability to invest in our brands and withstand unexpected shocks. And clearly, we are ahead of pace toward our 2026 target of a 15% operating profit margin. Because of how our business is performing, both from a top line and bottom line perspective, we are now raising our full year guidance. Our first half results came in better than expected, and we remain on track for our second half outlook. We feel good about our commercial activity now fully in the marketplace and that emerging markets will sustain their underlying momentum. Finally, we continue to progress on another element of our strategy, and that is our better day promise program. Slide number 15 provides just a few examples of this program in action during the second quarter. So, let me now turn it over to Amit, who will walk you through our financial results and outlook before I come back and discuss each of our businesses in more detail.\nAmit Banati: Thank you, Steve and hello everyone. Slide number 17 summarizes our key financial results for quarter two and the first half. As Steve said, we delivered another quarter of on algorithm results and another quarter of results that exceeded our expectations across all of these key metrics. Our organic growth in net sales in quarter two came in at 4%, remaining within our long-term target range. On a currency-neutral basis, our adjusted operating profit grew by 16% year-on-year, driven by the organic net sales growth and continued improvement in margins in spite of a double-digit increase in brand building. Our below-the-line items continue to be a modest year-on-year headwind, though less than anticipated, resulting in growth in earnings per share of 14% on a currency-neutral basis. Meanwhile, free cash flow also continued to increase year-on-year. Slide number 18 shows the major components of our year-on-year net sales growth in quarter two and the first half. Price/mix growth continued to drive organic net sales growth even as it moderated as expected outside of Nigeria, where we executed price increases in quarter one. Volume declined on elasticity impacts around the world, but especially in Nigeria. As Steve mentioned, that market accounted for virtually all of our volume decline in quarter two. So, the rest of our portfolio is clearly delivering on planned sequential improvement and even turn to growth in two of our regions. Moving along the graph, the small impact from last year's divestiture of our Russia business is now behind us as the transaction anniversaries at the start of quarter three. Foreign currency translation clipped net sales growth by about 8 percentage points in quarter two, principally reflecting the Nigerian Naira. Now, let's discuss profitability, starting with our gross profit on Slide number 19. The adjusted basis gross profit continued to increase year-on-year during quarter two, up 9%, excluding currency and up 5% with currency. This sustains a strong trend, as you can see on the slide. Meanwhile, we also continue to improve our gross profit margin with quarter two's margin up close to 340 basis points year-on-year. As we've discussed previously, the discontinued operations accounting used to recast 2022 and the first three quarters of 2023 takes into account only the expenses associated with our transition services agreement and not the pass-through of those expenses to W.K. Kellogg Company. Year-on-year, this comparison item again contributed about 100 basis points of our margin expansion during quarter two. And as we've also discussed previously, currency devaluations affected our country mix, contributing a year-on-year margin benefit in quarter two of approximately 150 basis points, a little less than quarter one and something that should moderate more meaningfully in the second half as we lap last year's largest devaluation of the Naira. Leaving out these two transitory items, our gross margin was still up by around 1 percentage point year-on-year, a recovery that continues to be aided by a resumed higher level of productivity and moderating input cost inflation. The fact that this gross margin restoration has continued to run ahead of pace gives us additional confidence in our full year outlook of more than 35%. We're experiencing growth and margin expansion at the operating profit line to, as shown on slide number 20. Operating profit in quarter two grew 16%, excluding currency and 13% with currency, sustaining a trend of year-on-year growth. Even if you exclude the impact of the year ago absence of transition services expense pass-through, our operating profit grew by more than 6% on this currency-neutral basis, remaining on our algorithm. This underlying growth was driven by an improving gross profit margin and good discipline on overhead, all of which more than offset the impact of a double-digit increase in brand building investment. Even with increased investment, we are improving our profitability and marching solidly towards our guidance for an operating profit margin of over 14% in 2024 and a target of 15% by 2026. Moving down the P&L, we come to our earnings per share walk on slide number 21. As you can see, all of our EPS growth quarter two was attributable to our growth in operating profit, just as it was in quarter one. Looking at our below-the-line items, we can see that they, again, largely offset each other. Interest expense again increased meaningfully year-on-year, reflecting higher interest rates. This was partially offset by an increase in other income, principally reflecting interest income and investment gains. Our effective tax rate remained in the mid-22% range. Joint venture earnings and minority interests were relatively immaterial year-on-year. Our average shares outstanding were flat. The result of these items was an increase in adjusted basis EPS of 12% in quarter two and 14% on a currency-neutral basis. Let's now turn to slide number 22, which shows our free cash flow and net debt position through quarter two. We remain ahead of last year on free cash flow through the first half though as we mentioned previously, some of this is related to the timing of a planned distribution from a post-retirement fund, which is expected to be offset later in the year. Even aside from that, though, our cash flow generation remains. Meantime, we have continued to trim our net debt even as we return sizable cash to share owners, mostly through our dividend. And our debt leverage remains well below our targeted ratio of net debt to trailing EBITDA of three times giving us excellent financial flexibility. Now let's discuss our increased guidance for the full year 2024, as shown on slide number 23. With half the year behind us, it is time to narrow the ranges we first gave at our Day at K Investor event 12 months ago. And because of the strength of our first half performance, we are in a position to raise this guidance. For net sales, we now expect organic growth of about 3.5%, an increase from our previous guidance that reflects our better than expected first half performance. We are prudently keeping our second half assumptions largely unchanged. Organic growth, of course, excludes currency translation, which based on exchange rates we saw during quarter two, would be a headwind of about 7% for the full year. For adjusted basis operating profit, we are raising and narrowing the range to $1.875 billion to $1.9 billion, again, primarily reflecting our first half delivery. We continue to expect margin expansion for the year, reaching above 35% for gross margin and about 14% for operating margin, though the year-on-year impacts moderate in second half, mainly because of what we are lapping then. We don't provide guidance on currency translation, but to give you an idea, if the exchange rate experienced during quarter two hold for the year, it would be about a negative 3% headwind to our operating profit. Guidance for adjusted basis earnings per share increases to a range of $3.65 and to $3.75, which incorporates the higher operating profit and other income that we experienced in the first half. Specifically, other income should retain its first upside before settling back to a run rate of $15 million to $20 million per quarter in the second half. Our effective tax rate is now expected to be in the mid-22% range, only slightly better than we previously communicated. These factors are partially offset by interest expense now expected to be higher given quarter two's run rate and joint venture earnings and minority interest collectively should run a little bit more negative in the second half than the first and we are raising our outlook for free cash flow to just above $1 billion with year-on-year growth driven by operating profit and despite capital expenditure temporarily elevated as a percentage of sales for expanded Pringles capacity in emerging markets as well as usual cash outlays related to our two network optimization projects. So we remain in a very good financial position. Our quarter one and quarter two results came in better than expected, enabling us to raise our guidance for the full year, and we are confident in the second half. We have solid commercial plans that already are improving our volume performance around the world, and this is starting to show up more plainly in our in-market data as well. Our profit margins continue to improve, progressing faster than planned, enabling us to reinvest in our brands and our balance sheet and cash flow remain in strong shape. And with that, let me now turn it back to Steve for a run-through of our businesses around the world.\nSteve Cahillane: Thanks, Amit. Let's start with Kellanova North America on Slide number 26. Our organic net sales were plus 1% in North America in the second quarter, lapping last year's revenue growth management actions and last year's relative lack of merchandising activity, our price/mix was down slightly, continuing and as expected, moderation that began over a year ago. Our performance on volume meanwhile, improved sequentially for a fourth consecutive quarter and turned positive in the second quarter. Industry-wide elasticities continued to be a growth headwind across our retail categories but our return to full commercial activity, including our launches of innovation reaching shelves during the second quarter led to volume growth in both consumption and shipments in our US retail business. This was augmented by strong growth outside of these measured US channels in our US away from home business and our business in Canada. North America's operating profit increased substantially year-on-year as margins continue to improve. Even excluding the impact of year-earlier recast figures not incorporating the pass-through of transition service expenses, North America's operating profit grew at a double-digit pace, aided by productivity and absorbing increased investment behind our brands. Slide number 27 shows North America split between snacks and frozen foods. During the second quarter, our snacks business increased both in volume and price mix year-on-year generating organic net sales growth of more than 1% even as it faced a relatively strong prior year quarter. In our much smaller frozen foods business, net sales were off slightly in the second quarter as we faced our toughest quarterly comparison of the year, but we did increase volume led by Eggo. Slide number 28 shows our volume recovery playing out in measured channels. We expect to sustain this improvement in consumption volume and share performance through the second half. So North America is delivering strong financial results while getting back to full commercial activity that is taking hold in the form of improving volume performance, both in shipments and consumption. And as we think about the year, as shown on Slide number 29, we remain right on track. We have increased brand building and merchandising and our stepped-up innovation is now in the marketplace. And we expect these investments to continue to improve our end market performance in the second half. Meanwhile, our margins continue to recover ahead of pace. This is a more focused team and portfolio since the spin-off and we expect continued delivery in the second half. Now let's turn to Kellanova Europe and Slide number 30. Our organic basis net sales in Europe declined a little less than 1% in the second quarter against our toughest quarterly comparison of the year. Our volume declines moderated led by growth in snacks in the U.K. Currency neutral adjusted basis operating profit grew by close to 7% year-on-year despite last year's midyear divestiture of Russia. Profit margins continue to recover with a strong rebound in profit funding a significant boost in brand building investment. On Slide #31, you can see our two major category groups in Europe. Snacks, which represent over half of our sales in Kellanova Europe grew organically by 1% year-on-year despite lapping last year's strongest double-digit growth. Pringles continues to perform well with strong consumption growth across key markets with particularly strong share gains in the U.K. and Spain and continued expansion Poland and Romania. And in portable wholesome snacks, we gained share in our biggest market, which is the U.K. In cereal, net sales declined by less than 3% in the quarter on category elasticities. Slide number 32 reminds you of what we've been planning for in Europe 2024. Despite the slight quarter two decline against tough comps, we remain on track to deliver a seventh straight year of organic net sales growth in Europe. Pringles continues to demonstrate momentum supported by innovation and exciting promotional partnerships. And we are ready and excited for our late quarter three launch of Cheez-It in the U.K., which will expand our snacking portfolio in Europe. In cereal, innovations like Tresor Browne are now in market and promotions like our Kellogg sponsored football camps are underway in the U.K. So we're confident that we can manage through category-wide elasticity headwinds. Meanwhile, we are making progress on our plans for optimizing our cereal portfolio and manufacturing network. Now let's look at our emerging markets regions, starting with Latin America and Slide number 33. Latin America's net sales increased by 4% organically in the second quarter sustaining a mid-single-digit growth rate on top of big growth in the year earlier quarter. Price/mix growth is moderating as expected we lap prior year actions to offset high cost inflation. Importantly, volume returned to growth in the quarter with gains in both snacks and cereal and led by Mexico. Operating profit increased in the second quarter on top of strong year-ago growth. Slide number 34 shows our Latin American net sales growth by category group. Organic net sales for our Snacks business in Latin America grew 4% year-on-year with growth in both volume and price/mix. Salty snacks categories remain in growth across key markets in the region despite elasticities and Pringles has continued to outpace the category in our two largest markets, Mexico and Brazil. Our cereal net sales also increased by 4% in the quarter, sustaining volume growth. Cereal categories in the region remain in growth despite elasticities, and we have outpaced the category this year in key markets, Mexico and Brazil. Slide number 35 reminds you of what to watch for in our Latin America business this year. Here, too, we expect a seventh straight year of organic net sales growth and we expect the growth to come from both snacks and cereal. Margins should improve, reflecting price pack architecture efforts as well as operating efficiencies and the potential for moderating input cost pressures later in the year. So, through the first half, Latin America is right on track. And we'll finish with our EMEA region, starting with Slide number 36. Once again, currency influence price increases in Nigeria drove substantially all of the regions 16% organic net sales growth in the quarter. Our business there continues to execute well pricing again earlier this year to keep up with currency rates and during the second quarter, its volume declines were not as severe as expected. This may have positive implications for our second half forecast, but we are taking a prudent approach. Nevertheless, these short-term challenges are dramatically outweighed by the long-term growth opportunity that this growing market and our advantaged assets provide us. Outside of Nigeria and our joint ventures with Tolaram, our organic net sales increased at a mid-single-digit rate in the second quarter. Volume declined only slightly year-on-year despite category elasticities and the negative demand impact of tensions in the Middle East. On a currency-neutral basis, EMEA's operating profit grew by 9%, with growth in both Nigeria and in the rest of EMEA and margins continuing to improve even with a substantial increase in brand-building investment. On Slide number 37, we see how our net sales growth split by major category groups. Noodles and others 26% organic growth reflects the currency-driven pricing in Nigeria, which was only partially offset by elasticity-driven double-digit declines in volume. Meanwhile, we continue to drive strong growth for Kellogg's noodles in South Africa and Egypt, gaining distribution and share in those markets and successfully launching this quarter into Saudi Arabia. In Snacks, we grew net sales organically by about 13% year-on-year with broad-based growth across the region led by Pringles. In cereal, our organic net sales grew 4%, and this too was broad-based across the region in spite of category elasticities. For EMEA, in 2024, we continue to watch for the elements listed on slide number 38. We expect this region record yet another year of good organic net sales growth and we expect growth both within Nigeria and in the rest of the region. Noodles remains a growth business for us in Africa. Pringles will sustain its momentum, supported by innovation, pack formats and distribution, and we expect to sustain growth in cereal, led by emerging markets. Meanwhile, EMEA's improvement of profit margins should continue. So let me summarize with slide number 40. With each passing quarter, including the second quarter, it should be increasingly clear that Kellanova today has a strategy and portfolio that is more focused, more growth oriented and more profitable than ever before. We're delivering on algorithm performance amidst a challenging industry environment. We have strengthened commercial plans for 2024, and they are already starting to yield gradual improvements in volume. We are committed to improving our profit margins and this improvement remains ahead of pace. We are raising our guidance, thanks to a strong first half and enviable position to be in, especially in the current industry environment. And yet, we refused to sit still. We continue to create the future, be it in adding growth capacity in Pringles and emerging markets, expanding Cheez-It into Europe, expanding noodles in Africa are continuing to increase investment behind the portfolio with some of the most differentiated brands in the world. This commitment driving shareholder value is shared by all of our Kellanova team members who deserve our thanks for all that they do. And now we'd be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nRob Dickerson: Super. Thanks so much. Good morning. So Steve, I guess, clearly, we could see improvement in North America volumes, which is great. Part of that looks to be from some proactive price investment. So I'm just curious, I think you said as you think through the back half, you do expect back half sustained volume improvement and then you have a great innovation slate. So really kind of the simple question is just, as you go for the sustained volume improvement in the back half of North America, would you say most of that is coming from you things like incremental distribution innovation? Or have you just been very proactive in the right way, kind of focused on certain price points that have been driving that volume improvement relative to the industry? Thanks.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. Thanks for the question, Rob. What I'd tell you is we've talked about getting back to full commercial activation. And that's really the story in North America. It's really led by Pringles, which returned first and has terrific momentum. It includes increased distribution with new shelf resets in the second quarter as you mentioned. It includes a full commercial innovation activation. We're back to levels that we haven't seen since pre-pandemic. And it's really that, Rob. It's a full commercial activation, gaining momentum. We returned to volume growth in the second quarter in North America. That will continue into the third and fourth quarter actually improve as activation around Cheez-It and some of our other brands starts to catch up to what we've done with Pringles, and in terms of pricing, we had to take, as you well know, a lot of price in the last two years. And so we're returning to the type of price promotion activity more or less that we saw pre-pandemic in a very rational environment. So bright spot for us is the second half of the year and the volume that we've seen in North America.\nRob Dickerson: Got it. Super.\nOperator: We now turn to Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about Europe, the volume under pressure as pricing is decelerating, but you also have some innovation coming. I think you highlighted Cheez-It. So just how would you characterize your go-forward in Europe, I know looking for another year of growth, but maybe how do you view exit rate and the complexion of trends in the market as you think about balancing pricing and volume going forward?\nSteve Cahillane: Yeah, Chris, I'd start with, Europe is a tough environment, always has been. It's tough this year. But in the second quarter, we faced our toughest comps, particularly with Pringles. And you heard us say in the prepared remarks that we have a lot of confidence, we're going to continue to grow in Europe, and that's going to be in the back half of the year. So we've got great back half plans. Our football sponsorship has really started late in this quarter, so that will continue into this quarter. So lots of confidence in Europe, lots of confidence in Europe continuing to grow. You saw that snacks did grow in the in the second quarter that will accelerate third and fourth quarter based on the activations. And we are very excited about the Cheez-It launch in the fourth quarter. And when I say very excited, it's just a great program that they put together in the UK. The customers are excited about it. The consumer testing of product is outstanding. And so we see big things for Cheez-It in the next couple of years. It's going to be a real growth driver for us, so bullish on Europe despite a challenging environment. I know that makes us a little different than some others, but our team has delivered now seven years of growth in Europe, and so that will continue this year.\nChris Carey: Thank you. And if I could, just as a follow-up on the pricing comment in North America. It's great to see the volumes. In fact, you did make a comment, I think, in the prepared remarks about a year ago, timing impacts with promotion or price activity, but would you expect pricing to stay negative as you -- certainly as you're clearly seeing this positive constructive uplift in volume as you go forward? Thanks so much.\nSteve Cahillane: We see pricing remaining very rational in the environment. Remember, we're lapping a real dearth of activity last year. So that's what you see when you see our year-over-year comparisons. We've talked about it quite a lot. We pulled back on commercial activation because of the bottleneck shortages. We were perhaps a little late compared to others in returning, but we've returned, but it's all very, very rational, prudent, and we see good volume growth and a good balance between price mix volume in the back half of the year for North America.\nChris Carey: Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nPeter Galbo: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.\nSteve Cahillane: Good morning.\nPeter Galbo: Steve, maybe in our just continued tour of the world here, having gone through North America and Europe. Latin America, I think you kind of had more of a standout quarter relative to what some of the peers have said particularly around maybe some delay in stimulus payments in Mexico and then also some weakness in Brazil. So maybe you can just talk a bit about more specifically the Kellanova quarter in Mexico and Brazil and then relative to kind of the macro that you're seeing there on the ground?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. So it was a good quarter in Latin America. Cereal and Snacks, all growing. Mexico having a terrific quarter, kind of record shares in the cereal business in Mexico and Pringles continuing to do extremely well, despite being somewhat capacity constrained because we're sourcing out of Jackson, Tennessee. Next year, we'll be sourcing out of Mexico, so really bullish on Pringles future opportunities in Mexico because of local sourcing. Brazil, you have to remember, Brazil was really impacted by some pretty devastating floods, but the underlying business in Brazil remains strong, really driven also by Pringles. Pringles' Momentum in Brazil is very, very good. So the Brazilian business is strong, but impacted by pretty devastating floods that obviously we all saw on news.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, Thank you. I was wondering if you could talk about North America price sensitivity in terms of like pack sizes and the price points. One of your competitors said that when points get above a certain level, like above $4, it's led to consumers actually exiting the category, and they've made some pretty substantial changes to adjust to that. Would you agree with that? Or is it just not really affecting your portfolio? Thanks.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes, Rob, I would agree with that, but I would also say that that we've been talking about for years. But right now, it's more extreme because the consumer is under so much pressure. So we've always talked about entry price points. We've always talked about price package architecture going back a number of years. We've been investing in the capability to have more pack sizes hit different price points. But I think what you're hearing in this environment is perhaps more than in a very long period of time, the absolute dollars are under more pressure. So the basket that people can fill is affected, obviously, by the absolute dollars in their pocket. And the consumer is so strained, it is -- it's become heightened in terms of making sure that you hit those right price points, particularly with consumers under $100,000 in household income with kids, that's where we're seeing the price sensitivity. And it also -- it varies by where you are in the monthly cycle as well. So we look at all of that -- it is important, more important in this environment than perhaps a more normal environment.\nRobert Moskow: And can I ask a follow-up? How meaningful is your Pringles launch, that's the mix Pringles launch in the back half? And what was the insight that made you think that coming -- introducing something out of the can is going to compete well in that very competitive marketplace.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. So I wouldn't look at Pringles Mingles being a meaningful difference maker in terms of our NSV forecast for the balance of the year. So we're only starting to hit it really were activated more in first quarter of next year. The insight is that people love the brand. We haven't stretched that brand outside the can. So that's a meaningful in -- the product is excluded. It is in the shape of a bow tie, Mr. Pringles bow tie. So it plays more on the Mr. P iconic V than it does the can. We believe product tests extremely well and Pringles stands for snacking in so many ways. So we're giving a launch outside the can, and we'll see how it goes.\nRobert Moskow: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We now turn to David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. I wanted just to ask a couple of questions on North America Snacks. You said in your comments, Steve, that there was consumption growth in the quarter, in 2Q. Was that -- we see consumption being down a bit? I assume maybe there was some growth in Canada or beyond the measured channels that we can't see. Maybe you can comment on that. But more importantly, I'm just wondering in the data that we are going to be tracking, are you expecting a return to at least that low single-digit growth that you're expecting in the beginning of the year for the second half in just the consumption, middle plus type stuff that has pretty good coverage. Would you expect that? And would the improvement -- if so, would the improvement be in the areas you were targeting earlier in the year around some of the merchandising and innovation on Cheez-It Rice Krispies Treats. Thank you.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes, David, thanks for the question. The -- what you're seeing in the measured channels, and you hit on it. What you're not seeing is very good growth in Canada and very good growth in our away-from-home channels. So the non-measured channels performed at a rate that led to consumption growth overall in North America. Pringles also, you see doing extremely well, lots and lots of momentum on Pringles. You see that in the measured channels, but it's also the same in the non-measured channel. So all those things together are what's leading to consumption growth. Going forward to your question, we would expect to see improvement in the measured channels as I mentioned, you've seen it in Pringles, which was kind of first out of the gate with our investments and with return to full commercial activation. You'll see that with the other big brands. You'll see that with Cheez-It in the back half of the year as well Rice Krispies Treats, Pop-Tarts and Eggo. So we would expect the measured channels start to catch up some of the non-measured channels as we get into the second half of the year and exit the year.\nDavid Palmer: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning.\nSteve Cahillane: Good morning, Micheal.\nMichael Lavery: Yes. Thanks. Just wanted to on Nigeria. Just wanted to touch on Nigeria. And obviously, with the pricing, you've got big lift, but of course, the currency and volumes are a big offset. I know you called out the volume momentum executing that, but what are you seeing there maybe sequentially, when could that improve? Have you seen any kind of digestion of the pricing that the consumers are adjusting and maybe the last are starting to mitigate? Just trying to understand, obviously, that's part of your emerging market footprint, you called out as growth drivers that ordinarily wouldn't be kind of a of a point stress. When can that turn and really be proper volume growth driver again?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. Thanks for the question. The color on JV collectively recorded a volume decline in the high teens against the price mix gain of more than 40% year-on-year. So that's obviously hugely substantive. And we've been talking about the elasticities and the fact that elasticities would have to start to show up, and we're seeing that. We also talked about it being in our forecast for the back half of the year. We're being very prudent about that. We actually think there might be some upside to that as we -- as the price lands has landed in Africa. But we'll just have to wait and see. The team is executing very well on the ground, but the consumer in Nigeria is under a tremendous amount of strain, you can see that in the headlines. It's in our forecast and perhaps there may be some upside. I don't know, Amit, do you want to add anything?\nAmit Banati: No, I think the only thing I'd add is that elasticities came in better than expected. So while the volume declines were in the teens, it was definitely better than what we had expected in the quarter. I think we need to continue to take some more pricing in some of our other categories. And so I think we've assumed that elasticity would be there in the second half. And we'll see -- we're encouraged by what we saw in the second quarter, but we are being prudent about the rest of the year.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: We now turn to Thomas Palmer with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nThomas Palmer: Good morning, and thanks for the question. You indicated that the guidance increase reflects mainly the first step upside and second half expectations were a little changed. I wanted to ask on the operating profit, I mean, maybe your expectations were different than consensus estimates, but I think the upside was quite a bit more than consensus estimates had. And just trying to understand if there's any incremental call-outs as we think about the second half of year in terms of pressure on that line that maybe right, would kind of limit that upside to guidance in terms of how you brand it?\nAmit Banati: So not really. I mean, I think if you kind of look at, and we've talked this previously as well, right, the gross margin progression will moderate in the second half as some of the things that we lapped start moderating. We obviously had the TSA pass through last year in quarter four. So that's -- so we'll be lapping that I think the bottlenecks and shortages, which was a big driver of improved gross margin, particularly in quarter one, I think that's firmly behind us. We saw a little bit of that in quarter two, but it was largely in quarter one. So you won't have that in the second half. And then the country mix impact driven by the naira in Nigeria will also -- you'll start lapping that. If you recall, last year, the biggest devaluation in the Naira was kind of around this time, so in quarter three. So you're going to start lapping that. So we continue to -- we're very pleased with the progress that we're making on the margins. It's coming in better than expected. But we continue to see progression, but not as much as we saw in the first half because of some of the items that we are lapping. So I'd say that's probably the biggest driver of brand building, we saw a good double-digit increase in the first half. That's going to moderate in the second half because if you recall last year, in the second half, we had ramped up brand building. So the absolute pressure continues to be very good. But when you look at it versus the ramp up in the second half, the growth moderates. So I think those are some of the puts and takes in terms of the second half operating profit.\nSteve Powers: Okay. Thank you. And then on inflation, I think you previously noted, you thought it would be pretty neutral for the year. Is this still the expectation? And then is there anything to consider in terms of the cadence over the course of 2024 in terms of that rate? Thanks.\nAmit Banati: No real change. I think that continues to be our outlook to be neutral to slightly inflationary. I think costs are coming in pretty much as we had expected. Obviously, in Nigeria, we are seeing inflation come through probably at a higher rate. But other than that, costs are coming in pretty much in line with expectations.\nSteve Powers: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nKen Goldman: Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask about gross margins. The increases for you are impressive, obviously. And it's a trend we're seeing across the food group in general. But at the same time, we're also increasingly hearing from domestic food retailers, your customers that they're increasingly aware, I guess, of their vendors' gross margin -- gross margin growth, if I can say that, as volumes remain constrained. So I guess the question is understanding that much of the industries margin increases coming from efficiency efforts that should be sticky? How do you think about that balance between inherently wanting to try and drive margins higher and being cognizant of what your customers are saying lately, if that makes sense.\nSteve Cahillane: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Ken. Obviously, we all want to focus on gross margins because it\u2019s what drives the health of the business. And we're doing it through productivity. We're doing it by getting back to where we were in some ways because of the bottlenecks and the shortages, and we're increasing our brand building investment quite substantially, which really helps put together winning retail programs. So what we need to do is grow faster than the retailers' same-store sales through great activation, great commercial activation have the right price point for the consumers, so we meet them where they are. And then you get into a much more constructive dialogue with customers versus who's taking what share of the pie. And so yeah, we are growing our gross margins, but against a backdrop of where we were, and we are increasing our brand-building investments, which helps our customers drive volume through their outlets. So that's how -- that's basically how we would look at that.\nKen Goldman: It makes sense. Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: We now turn to Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone. Can I just ask about the innovation graph that you put up? Obviously, you're back up to levels that are slightly above where you were in 2021. Are you actually able to give us a number on percentage of sales coming from new products this year? And perhaps more importantly, are you back up to where you would expect to be long-term? Or is there another step-up that we might expect over the next year or two. And just as a super quick follow-up, should we expect guidance for 2025 when you report next quarter?\nSteve Cahillane: Yeah. Thanks, Alexia. So let's work backwards. We always release guidance at our February earnings, and that's what we'll do again this time. In terms of innovation, we don't really release numbers against that, but we are back to where we were pre-pandemic, as you saw on the slide. And that's actually going to get better because that obviously includes a Cheez-It launch, it includes the Pringles Mingles launch, and there's a whole host of innovations really by category, by brand group. So it's meaningfully different than it was in the last couple of years back to where we were in 2019 and 2018. 2019 was the Snap launch, which was a good year for us, and we're beating that. So we feel very good about innovating, and we've got a great calendar for next year as well when we get to February, we'll talk about not only guidance for the year, but would give some outlook as to exactly the innovations that will be launched in 2025.\nAlexia Howard: Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nSteve Powers: Hey, good morning. Hey, Steve, I wanted to follow up on -- I think it was Chris Carey's question and your response. I think you talked about expecting a good balance of volume, price and mix in the back half in North America. And I guess, the question is, is that to say that you expect each of those components to be positive in the back half.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. No, we don't really get into breaking that down in terms of a forecast. But I think we're returning to the type of balance that we seek. And the most important really is getting back to volume because it's a little bit aberrant when you look at it because of what we're lapping. We're lapping these enormous prices and these declines in volume. So now we're looking at better volume and less price. And so when you look at what you're lapping, it's just kind of strange. So we're getting back to volume growth, which I think is going to drive NSV growth, then you can kind of back into what that might look like.\nAmit Banati: I think the only thing I add is that\u2026\nSteve Cahillane: Go ahead, Amit.\nAmit Banati: The only thing I\u2019d add Steve, when you look at our second half is that if you exclude Nigeria, where we've talked, right, that we expect -- we continue to expect volume declines because of the elasticity and because of the pricing that we're taking. If you exclude that, we pretty much expect volume growth in most of our -- in all of our other regions other than Nigeria. So I think you should expect that trend to continue for us in the second half.\nSteve Powers: Okay. That all makes sense. I guess the follow-up, though, is that you've had good returns on this sort of return to activation and promotional investment that you've made so far. But as I'm sure you're aware, a lot of your direct, indirect competitors, some of them reported today, some of some of them for earliest week reported earlier in the month, all have talked about kind of incremental step-ups in investment as we go through the back half. So you've talked about the environment as rational. Do you view those comments as rational and amidst the competitive set arguably leaning in a bit more the back half, do you expect the same kind of return on your run rate investments.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. No, I would just reiterate, we do see it as rational. We see things returning to where they were pre-pandemic, not anything more than that. The things that are going to drive these categories are innovation, brand building, quality display merchandising, all those types of things. We've all been impacted by extraordinary input cost inflation. So we've had to take a lot of price. The consumers obviously reacted to that. But a lot of that price discovery has happened. Consumers are getting more used to these prices. It doesn't mean they're not still under pressure and that we have to make sure to some of the earlier conversations, we're hitting the right price points, the right pack sizes, the right promotions at the right time in the month, all those types of things are really quite important, but brands matter, and we have to make sure that we're continuing to invest in our brands and innovation, meeting the consumers where they are. But having said all that, we continue to forecast a rational pricing environment going forward.\nSteve Powers: Okay, very good. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.\nJohn Renwick: I think we probably have time for one more question, operator?\nOperator: Our last question comes from Max Gumport with BNP Paribas. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nMax Gumport: Hey thanks for the question. Just wanted to follow-up on the last one there and get a better sense for should we expect -- or why do you not think your business needs more price investment, given what we're hearing from all of your competitors, particularly competitors in your near-end [ph] categories within snacking. It feels like we're hearing more and more about these companies saying that the consumer needs some pricing give back. It feels like the retailers are saying the same. I just want to make sure I understand why your own business doesn't need that? thank you.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes, Max, I'd just point you to we had a terrific second quarter. We raised our guidance. We've got great confidence. You can't speak to where everybody else is, but we feel we feel very, very good about where we are, good about our innovations. We feel good about the return we're getting from our brand building. We feel good about our geographic portfolio. And I hope that you heard that come through in not only the results but the outlook. And so I'd just point you right to there and say, we don't feel like we're missing anything. We don't feel like we need to do anything on the pricing front that we're not already doing that you haven't seen because again, we -- here we are today announcing good results, very good results and raising guidance. So, I just would ended that.\nMax Gumport: Thanks very much.\nJohn Renwick: Maybe one more.\nOperator: Yes, we have a question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Just a super quick one. Steve, with all of the activation, commercial activation back up to more normal levels, we're hearing a lot of that, about more normal levels of promotional activity from peers as well. It's all off of obviously much higher list pricing. So, promoted price points are still quite a bit higher. So, I'm just curious what you're seeing around lift on promotional activity, if it's kind of where you have always seen it? Is it better, worse or how that's trending? That's it. Thanks so much.\nSteve Cahillane: Great question, Andrew. I'd say if you go back at the beginning of the year and the end of last year, the lifts were not great because I think the price discovery was still happening, as you point out, the higher list prices we're starting to improve. And so sequentially, week-in and week-out, the investments that we're making are seeing a better return. And that's part of our confidence in the back half of the year into next year that the right level of investment will start to yield the type of returns that we saw pre-pandemic.\nAndrew Lazar: Thanks so much.\nOperator: This concludes our Q&A. I'll now hand back to John Renwick for closing remarks.\nJohn Renwick: Okay. Well, thank you, everyone, for your interest and your time. And if you do have follow-up questions, please do not hesitate to call us. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, today's call has now concluded. We'd like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve Cahillane",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We're once again pleased to report strong quarterly results that are clear evidence of our more growth-oriented and more profitable portfolio following last fall's spin-off. Our year-on-year organic growth in net sales was again on algorithm and volume trends improved sequentially again outside of Nigeria. Our year-on-year currency neutral operating profit growth was also on algorithm, and we continue to improve our profit margins. And we've returned to full commercial activity with our stepped-up innovation reaching shelves in the second quarter. Delighting consumers is never more important than it is right now, and we now have our full plan in the marketplace, which should help us continue to improve our end-market performance in the second half. On Slide number 6, we remind you of our strategy, differentiate, drive and deliver, which we continue to execute, helping us to deliver our near-term commitments, but also to build for a strong future and drive shareowner value. On Slide number 7, we remind you of our global footprint, diversification and exposure to faster-growing markets is a true point of differentiation for Kellanova. This differentiated footprint, along with our return to full commercial activity around the world, contributed to our continued sequential improvement in volume in most of our regions. The chart on Slide number 8 excludes our joint ventures in Africa where currency-driven price increases in Nigeria have resulted in recent elasticities as we expected. We see that our businesses outside those JVs posted a fourth consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in volume. And we drove the sequential improvement across our regions. Europe and the rest of EMEA both recorded moderating volume declines and North America and Latin America both returned to outright volume growth. Another key driver is shown on Slide number 9, innovation. As discussed previously, we are returning to a full innovation launch calendar after the pandemic era supply disruptions. As you can see on the slide, we have a plethora of innovations launching across every one regions this year, ranging from limited additions to new flavors to amplified wellness credentials, to entirely new food platforms. I'll just highlight a few notables. In the second half, we will be launching Pringles Mingles in North America, our first out-of-the-can launch in the United States in over 15 years. In late Q3, we will be introducing Cheez-It to Europe with a big launch in the UK supported by a full arsenal of sampling, social media and public relations and advertising. We've innovated in away-from-home channels as well, sometimes leveraging these channels to drive consumer awareness. A good example is our partnering with Taco Bell to launch a bit Cheez-It Crunchwrap Supreme and a big Cheez-It Tostada. So we feel very good about the quality of our innovations and the buzz, trial and incremental purchases they will generate. Indeed, this heavy innovation calendar should bring us back to normal levels of net sales contribution from innovation, Slide number 10 measures year one incremental sales from innovation launches expressed as a percent of our total net sales. Notice how the incremental net sales we expect to generate from this year's innovation launches are much higher than the last couple of years when we have been contending with global supply disruptions. Getting back to delighting consumers through innovation is a key component of what we refer to as getting back to full commercial activity. Another good sign is shown on slide number 11. In our return to full commercial activity, we obviously prioritized our biggest brand, Pringles. The chart shows how this investment and activity is improving our net sales growth and in-market performance for this highly differentiated brand. All of it led to another quarter of differentiated results, starting with organic net sales growth. Slide number 12 shows how we continue to well outpace the median growth of our peer group, including our more directly comparable snacking and international peers. This is precisely the greater growth orientation I mentioned earlier about our strategy and portfolio. Now, let's talk about how we are a more profitable company than we were previously. Slide number 13 shows how our year-to-date gross profit margin and operating profit margin this year as Kellanova are meaningfully higher than the same periods pre-pandemic and pre-spin-off. And our improvement in margins continued the second quarter as Amit will discuss in a moment, even with a substantial increase in brand investment. Improving our margins is an important part of our strategy as they fuel our ability to invest in our brands and withstand unexpected shocks. And clearly, we are ahead of pace toward our 2026 target of a 15% operating profit margin. Because of how our business is performing, both from a top line and bottom line perspective, we are now raising our full year guidance. Our first half results came in better than expected, and we remain on track for our second half outlook. We feel good about our commercial activity now fully in the marketplace and that emerging markets will sustain their underlying momentum. Finally, we continue to progress on another element of our strategy, and that is our better day promise program. Slide number 15 provides just a few examples of this program in action during the second quarter. So, let me now turn it over to Amit, who will walk you through our financial results and outlook before I come back and discuss each of our businesses in more detail. Thanks, Amit. Let's start with Kellanova North America on Slide number 26. Our organic net sales were plus 1% in North America in the second quarter, lapping last year's revenue growth management actions and last year's relative lack of merchandising activity, our price/mix was down slightly, continuing and as expected, moderation that began over a year ago. Our performance on volume meanwhile, improved sequentially for a fourth consecutive quarter and turned positive in the second quarter. Industry-wide elasticities continued to be a growth headwind across our retail categories but our return to full commercial activity, including our launches of innovation reaching shelves during the second quarter led to volume growth in both consumption and shipments in our US retail business. This was augmented by strong growth outside of these measured US channels in our US away from home business and our business in Canada. North America's operating profit increased substantially year-on-year as margins continue to improve. Even excluding the impact of year-earlier recast figures not incorporating the pass-through of transition service expenses, North America's operating profit grew at a double-digit pace, aided by productivity and absorbing increased investment behind our brands. Slide number 27 shows North America split between snacks and frozen foods. During the second quarter, our snacks business increased both in volume and price mix year-on-year generating organic net sales growth of more than 1% even as it faced a relatively strong prior year quarter. In our much smaller frozen foods business, net sales were off slightly in the second quarter as we faced our toughest quarterly comparison of the year, but we did increase volume led by Eggo. Slide number 28 shows our volume recovery playing out in measured channels. We expect to sustain this improvement in consumption volume and share performance through the second half. So North America is delivering strong financial results while getting back to full commercial activity that is taking hold in the form of improving volume performance, both in shipments and consumption. And as we think about the year, as shown on Slide number 29, we remain right on track. We have increased brand building and merchandising and our stepped-up innovation is now in the marketplace. And we expect these investments to continue to improve our end market performance in the second half. Meanwhile, our margins continue to recover ahead of pace. This is a more focused team and portfolio since the spin-off and we expect continued delivery in the second half. Now let's turn to Kellanova Europe and Slide number 30. Our organic basis net sales in Europe declined a little less than 1% in the second quarter against our toughest quarterly comparison of the year. Our volume declines moderated led by growth in snacks in the U.K. Currency neutral adjusted basis operating profit grew by close to 7% year-on-year despite last year's midyear divestiture of Russia. Profit margins continue to recover with a strong rebound in profit funding a significant boost in brand building investment. On Slide #31, you can see our two major category groups in Europe. Snacks, which represent over half of our sales in Kellanova Europe grew organically by 1% year-on-year despite lapping last year's strongest double-digit growth. Pringles continues to perform well with strong consumption growth across key markets with particularly strong share gains in the U.K. and Spain and continued expansion Poland and Romania. And in portable wholesome snacks, we gained share in our biggest market, which is the U.K. In cereal, net sales declined by less than 3% in the quarter on category elasticities. Slide number 32 reminds you of what we've been planning for in Europe 2024. Despite the slight quarter two decline against tough comps, we remain on track to deliver a seventh straight year of organic net sales growth in Europe. Pringles continues to demonstrate momentum supported by innovation and exciting promotional partnerships. And we are ready and excited for our late quarter three launch of Cheez-It in the U.K., which will expand our snacking portfolio in Europe. In cereal, innovations like Tresor Browne are now in market and promotions like our Kellogg sponsored football camps are underway in the U.K. So we're confident that we can manage through category-wide elasticity headwinds. Meanwhile, we are making progress on our plans for optimizing our cereal portfolio and manufacturing network. Now let's look at our emerging markets regions, starting with Latin America and Slide number 33. Latin America's net sales increased by 4% organically in the second quarter sustaining a mid-single-digit growth rate on top of big growth in the year earlier quarter. Price/mix growth is moderating as expected we lap prior year actions to offset high cost inflation. Importantly, volume returned to growth in the quarter with gains in both snacks and cereal and led by Mexico. Operating profit increased in the second quarter on top of strong year-ago growth. Slide number 34 shows our Latin American net sales growth by category group. Organic net sales for our Snacks business in Latin America grew 4% year-on-year with growth in both volume and price/mix. Salty snacks categories remain in growth across key markets in the region despite elasticities and Pringles has continued to outpace the category in our two largest markets, Mexico and Brazil. Our cereal net sales also increased by 4% in the quarter, sustaining volume growth. Cereal categories in the region remain in growth despite elasticities, and we have outpaced the category this year in key markets, Mexico and Brazil. Slide number 35 reminds you of what to watch for in our Latin America business this year. Here, too, we expect a seventh straight year of organic net sales growth and we expect the growth to come from both snacks and cereal. Margins should improve, reflecting price pack architecture efforts as well as operating efficiencies and the potential for moderating input cost pressures later in the year. So, through the first half, Latin America is right on track. And we'll finish with our EMEA region, starting with Slide number 36. Once again, currency influence price increases in Nigeria drove substantially all of the regions 16% organic net sales growth in the quarter. Our business there continues to execute well pricing again earlier this year to keep up with currency rates and during the second quarter, its volume declines were not as severe as expected. This may have positive implications for our second half forecast, but we are taking a prudent approach. Nevertheless, these short-term challenges are dramatically outweighed by the long-term growth opportunity that this growing market and our advantaged assets provide us. Outside of Nigeria and our joint ventures with Tolaram, our organic net sales increased at a mid-single-digit rate in the second quarter. Volume declined only slightly year-on-year despite category elasticities and the negative demand impact of tensions in the Middle East. On a currency-neutral basis, EMEA's operating profit grew by 9%, with growth in both Nigeria and in the rest of EMEA and margins continuing to improve even with a substantial increase in brand-building investment. On Slide number 37, we see how our net sales growth split by major category groups. Noodles and others 26% organic growth reflects the currency-driven pricing in Nigeria, which was only partially offset by elasticity-driven double-digit declines in volume. Meanwhile, we continue to drive strong growth for Kellogg's noodles in South Africa and Egypt, gaining distribution and share in those markets and successfully launching this quarter into Saudi Arabia. In Snacks, we grew net sales organically by about 13% year-on-year with broad-based growth across the region led by Pringles. In cereal, our organic net sales grew 4%, and this too was broad-based across the region in spite of category elasticities. For EMEA, in 2024, we continue to watch for the elements listed on slide number 38. We expect this region record yet another year of good organic net sales growth and we expect growth both within Nigeria and in the rest of the region. Noodles remains a growth business for us in Africa. Pringles will sustain its momentum, supported by innovation, pack formats and distribution, and we expect to sustain growth in cereal, led by emerging markets. Meanwhile, EMEA's improvement of profit margins should continue. So let me summarize with slide number 40. With each passing quarter, including the second quarter, it should be increasingly clear that Kellanova today has a strategy and portfolio that is more focused, more growth oriented and more profitable than ever before. We're delivering on algorithm performance amidst a challenging industry environment. We have strengthened commercial plans for 2024, and they are already starting to yield gradual improvements in volume. We are committed to improving our profit margins and this improvement remains ahead of pace. We are raising our guidance, thanks to a strong first half and enviable position to be in, especially in the current industry environment. And yet, we refused to sit still. We continue to create the future, be it in adding growth capacity in Pringles and emerging markets, expanding Cheez-It into Europe, expanding noodles in Africa are continuing to increase investment behind the portfolio with some of the most differentiated brands in the world. This commitment driving shareholder value is shared by all of our Kellanova team members who deserve our thanks for all that they do. And now we'd be happy to take your questions. Yes. Thanks for the question, Rob. What I'd tell you is we've talked about getting back to full commercial activation. And that's really the story in North America. It's really led by Pringles, which returned first and has terrific momentum. It includes increased distribution with new shelf resets in the second quarter as you mentioned. It includes a full commercial innovation activation. We're back to levels that we haven't seen since pre-pandemic. And it's really that, Rob. It's a full commercial activation, gaining momentum. We returned to volume growth in the second quarter in North America. That will continue into the third and fourth quarter actually improve as activation around Cheez-It and some of our other brands starts to catch up to what we've done with Pringles, and in terms of pricing, we had to take, as you well know, a lot of price in the last two years. And so we're returning to the type of price promotion activity more or less that we saw pre-pandemic in a very rational environment. So bright spot for us is the second half of the year and the volume that we've seen in North America. Yeah, Chris, I'd start with, Europe is a tough environment, always has been. It's tough this year. But in the second quarter, we faced our toughest comps, particularly with Pringles. And you heard us say in the prepared remarks that we have a lot of confidence, we're going to continue to grow in Europe, and that's going to be in the back half of the year. So we've got great back half plans. Our football sponsorship has really started late in this quarter, so that will continue into this quarter. So lots of confidence in Europe, lots of confidence in Europe continuing to grow. You saw that snacks did grow in the in the second quarter that will accelerate third and fourth quarter based on the activations. And we are very excited about the Cheez-It launch in the fourth quarter. And when I say very excited, it's just a great program that they put together in the UK. The customers are excited about it. The consumer testing of product is outstanding. And so we see big things for Cheez-It in the next couple of years. It's going to be a real growth driver for us, so bullish on Europe despite a challenging environment. I know that makes us a little different than some others, but our team has delivered now seven years of growth in Europe, and so that will continue this year. We see pricing remaining very rational in the environment. Remember, we're lapping a real dearth of activity last year. So that's what you see when you see our year-over-year comparisons. We've talked about it quite a lot. We pulled back on commercial activation because of the bottleneck shortages. We were perhaps a little late compared to others in returning, but we've returned, but it's all very, very rational, prudent, and we see good volume growth and a good balance between price mix volume in the back half of the year for North America. Good morning. Yes. So it was a good quarter in Latin America. Cereal and Snacks, all growing. Mexico having a terrific quarter, kind of record shares in the cereal business in Mexico and Pringles continuing to do extremely well, despite being somewhat capacity constrained because we're sourcing out of Jackson, Tennessee. Next year, we'll be sourcing out of Mexico, so really bullish on Pringles future opportunities in Mexico because of local sourcing. Brazil, you have to remember, Brazil was really impacted by some pretty devastating floods, but the underlying business in Brazil remains strong, really driven also by Pringles. Pringles' Momentum in Brazil is very, very good. So the Brazilian business is strong, but impacted by pretty devastating floods that obviously we all saw on news. Yes, Rob, I would agree with that, but I would also say that that we've been talking about for years. But right now, it's more extreme because the consumer is under so much pressure. So we've always talked about entry price points. We've always talked about price package architecture going back a number of years. We've been investing in the capability to have more pack sizes hit different price points. But I think what you're hearing in this environment is perhaps more than in a very long period of time, the absolute dollars are under more pressure. So the basket that people can fill is affected, obviously, by the absolute dollars in their pocket. And the consumer is so strained, it is -- it's become heightened in terms of making sure that you hit those right price points, particularly with consumers under $100,000 in household income with kids, that's where we're seeing the price sensitivity. And it also -- it varies by where you are in the monthly cycle as well. So we look at all of that -- it is important, more important in this environment than perhaps a more normal environment. Yes. So I wouldn't look at Pringles Mingles being a meaningful difference maker in terms of our NSV forecast for the balance of the year. So we're only starting to hit it really were activated more in first quarter of next year. The insight is that people love the brand. We haven't stretched that brand outside the can. So that's a meaningful in -- the product is excluded. It is in the shape of a bow tie, Mr. Pringles bow tie. So it plays more on the Mr. P iconic V than it does the can. We believe product tests extremely well and Pringles stands for snacking in so many ways. So we're giving a launch outside the can, and we'll see how it goes. Yes, David, thanks for the question. The -- what you're seeing in the measured channels, and you hit on it. What you're not seeing is very good growth in Canada and very good growth in our away-from-home channels. So the non-measured channels performed at a rate that led to consumption growth overall in North America. Pringles also, you see doing extremely well, lots and lots of momentum on Pringles. You see that in the measured channels, but it's also the same in the non-measured channel. So all those things together are what's leading to consumption growth. Going forward to your question, we would expect to see improvement in the measured channels as I mentioned, you've seen it in Pringles, which was kind of first out of the gate with our investments and with return to full commercial activation. You'll see that with the other big brands. You'll see that with Cheez-It in the back half of the year as well Rice Krispies Treats, Pop-Tarts and Eggo. So we would expect the measured channels start to catch up some of the non-measured channels as we get into the second half of the year and exit the year. Good morning, Micheal. Yes. Thanks for the question. The color on JV collectively recorded a volume decline in the high teens against the price mix gain of more than 40% year-on-year. So that's obviously hugely substantive. And we've been talking about the elasticities and the fact that elasticities would have to start to show up, and we're seeing that. We also talked about it being in our forecast for the back half of the year. We're being very prudent about that. We actually think there might be some upside to that as we -- as the price lands has landed in Africa. But we'll just have to wait and see. The team is executing very well on the ground, but the consumer in Nigeria is under a tremendous amount of strain, you can see that in the headlines. It's in our forecast and perhaps there may be some upside. I don't know, Amit, do you want to add anything? Yeah. Thanks for the question, Ken. Obviously, we all want to focus on gross margins because it's what drives the health of the business. And we're doing it through productivity. We're doing it by getting back to where we were in some ways because of the bottlenecks and the shortages, and we're increasing our brand building investment quite substantially, which really helps put together winning retail programs. So what we need to do is grow faster than the retailers' same-store sales through great activation, great commercial activation have the right price point for the consumers, so we meet them where they are. And then you get into a much more constructive dialogue with customers versus who's taking what share of the pie. And so yeah, we are growing our gross margins, but against a backdrop of where we were, and we are increasing our brand-building investments, which helps our customers drive volume through their outlets. So that's how -- that's basically how we would look at that. Yeah. Thanks, Alexia. So let's work backwards. We always release guidance at our February earnings, and that's what we'll do again this time. In terms of innovation, we don't really release numbers against that, but we are back to where we were pre-pandemic, as you saw on the slide. And that's actually going to get better because that obviously includes a Cheez-It launch, it includes the Pringles Mingles launch, and there's a whole host of innovations really by category, by brand group. So it's meaningfully different than it was in the last couple of years back to where we were in 2019 and 2018. 2019 was the Snap launch, which was a good year for us, and we're beating that. So we feel very good about innovating, and we've got a great calendar for next year as well when we get to February, we'll talk about not only guidance for the year, but would give some outlook as to exactly the innovations that will be launched in 2025. Yes. No, we don't really get into breaking that down in terms of a forecast. But I think we're returning to the type of balance that we seek. And the most important really is getting back to volume because it's a little bit aberrant when you look at it because of what we're lapping. We're lapping these enormous prices and these declines in volume. So now we're looking at better volume and less price. And so when you look at what you're lapping, it's just kind of strange. So we're getting back to volume growth, which I think is going to drive NSV growth, then you can kind of back into what that might look like. Go ahead, Amit. Yes. No, I would just reiterate, we do see it as rational. We see things returning to where they were pre-pandemic, not anything more than that. The things that are going to drive these categories are innovation, brand building, quality display merchandising, all those types of things. We've all been impacted by extraordinary input cost inflation. So we've had to take a lot of price. The consumers obviously reacted to that. But a lot of that price discovery has happened. Consumers are getting more used to these prices. It doesn't mean they're not still under pressure and that we have to make sure to some of the earlier conversations, we're hitting the right price points, the right pack sizes, the right promotions at the right time in the month, all those types of things are really quite important, but brands matter, and we have to make sure that we're continuing to invest in our brands and innovation, meeting the consumers where they are. But having said all that, we continue to forecast a rational pricing environment going forward. Yes, Max, I'd just point you to we had a terrific second quarter. We raised our guidance. We've got great confidence. You can't speak to where everybody else is, but we feel we feel very, very good about where we are, good about our innovations. We feel good about the return we're getting from our brand building. We feel good about our geographic portfolio. And I hope that you heard that come through in not only the results but the outlook. And so I'd just point you right to there and say, we don't feel like we're missing anything. We don't feel like we need to do anything on the pricing front that we're not already doing that you haven't seen because again, we -- here we are today announcing good results, very good results and raising guidance. So, I just would ended that. Great question, Andrew. I'd say if you go back at the beginning of the year and the end of last year, the lifts were not great because I think the price discovery was still happening, as you point out, the higher list prices we're starting to improve. And so sequentially, week-in and week-out, the investments that we're making are seeing a better return. And that's part of our confidence in the back half of the year into next year that the right level of investment will start to yield the type of returns that we saw pre-pandemic."

            "name": "Amit Banati",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve and hello everyone. Slide number 17 summarizes our key financial results for quarter two and the first half. As Steve said, we delivered another quarter of on algorithm results and another quarter of results that exceeded our expectations across all of these key metrics. Our organic growth in net sales in quarter two came in at 4%, remaining within our long-term target range. On a currency-neutral basis, our adjusted operating profit grew by 16% year-on-year, driven by the organic net sales growth and continued improvement in margins in spite of a double-digit increase in brand building. Our below-the-line items continue to be a modest year-on-year headwind, though less than anticipated, resulting in growth in earnings per share of 14% on a currency-neutral basis. Meanwhile, free cash flow also continued to increase year-on-year. Slide number 18 shows the major components of our year-on-year net sales growth in quarter two and the first half. Price/mix growth continued to drive organic net sales growth even as it moderated as expected outside of Nigeria, where we executed price increases in quarter one. Volume declined on elasticity impacts around the world, but especially in Nigeria. As Steve mentioned, that market accounted for virtually all of our volume decline in quarter two. So, the rest of our portfolio is clearly delivering on planned sequential improvement and even turn to growth in two of our regions. Moving along the graph, the small impact from last year's divestiture of our Russia business is now behind us as the transaction anniversaries at the start of quarter three. Foreign currency translation clipped net sales growth by about 8 percentage points in quarter two, principally reflecting the Nigerian Naira. Now, let's discuss profitability, starting with our gross profit on Slide number 19. The adjusted basis gross profit continued to increase year-on-year during quarter two, up 9%, excluding currency and up 5% with currency. This sustains a strong trend, as you can see on the slide. Meanwhile, we also continue to improve our gross profit margin with quarter two's margin up close to 340 basis points year-on-year. As we've discussed previously, the discontinued operations accounting used to recast 2022 and the first three quarters of 2023 takes into account only the expenses associated with our transition services agreement and not the pass-through of those expenses to W.K. Kellogg Company. Year-on-year, this comparison item again contributed about 100 basis points of our margin expansion during quarter two. And as we've also discussed previously, currency devaluations affected our country mix, contributing a year-on-year margin benefit in quarter two of approximately 150 basis points, a little less than quarter one and something that should moderate more meaningfully in the second half as we lap last year's largest devaluation of the Naira. Leaving out these two transitory items, our gross margin was still up by around 1 percentage point year-on-year, a recovery that continues to be aided by a resumed higher level of productivity and moderating input cost inflation. The fact that this gross margin restoration has continued to run ahead of pace gives us additional confidence in our full year outlook of more than 35%. We're experiencing growth and margin expansion at the operating profit line to, as shown on slide number 20. Operating profit in quarter two grew 16%, excluding currency and 13% with currency, sustaining a trend of year-on-year growth. Even if you exclude the impact of the year ago absence of transition services expense pass-through, our operating profit grew by more than 6% on this currency-neutral basis, remaining on our algorithm. This underlying growth was driven by an improving gross profit margin and good discipline on overhead, all of which more than offset the impact of a double-digit increase in brand building investment. Even with increased investment, we are improving our profitability and marching solidly towards our guidance for an operating profit margin of over 14% in 2024 and a target of 15% by 2026. Moving down the P&L, we come to our earnings per share walk on slide number 21. As you can see, all of our EPS growth quarter two was attributable to our growth in operating profit, just as it was in quarter one. Looking at our below-the-line items, we can see that they, again, largely offset each other. Interest expense again increased meaningfully year-on-year, reflecting higher interest rates. This was partially offset by an increase in other income, principally reflecting interest income and investment gains. Our effective tax rate remained in the mid-22% range. Joint venture earnings and minority interests were relatively immaterial year-on-year. Our average shares outstanding were flat. The result of these items was an increase in adjusted basis EPS of 12% in quarter two and 14% on a currency-neutral basis. Let's now turn to slide number 22, which shows our free cash flow and net debt position through quarter two. We remain ahead of last year on free cash flow through the first half though as we mentioned previously, some of this is related to the timing of a planned distribution from a post-retirement fund, which is expected to be offset later in the year. Even aside from that, though, our cash flow generation remains. Meantime, we have continued to trim our net debt even as we return sizable cash to share owners, mostly through our dividend. And our debt leverage remains well below our targeted ratio of net debt to trailing EBITDA of three times giving us excellent financial flexibility. Now let's discuss our increased guidance for the full year 2024, as shown on slide number 23. With half the year behind us, it is time to narrow the ranges we first gave at our Day at K Investor event 12 months ago. And because of the strength of our first half performance, we are in a position to raise this guidance. For net sales, we now expect organic growth of about 3.5%, an increase from our previous guidance that reflects our better than expected first half performance. We are prudently keeping our second half assumptions largely unchanged. Organic growth, of course, excludes currency translation, which based on exchange rates we saw during quarter two, would be a headwind of about 7% for the full year. For adjusted basis operating profit, we are raising and narrowing the range to $1.875 billion to $1.9 billion, again, primarily reflecting our first half delivery. We continue to expect margin expansion for the year, reaching above 35% for gross margin and about 14% for operating margin, though the year-on-year impacts moderate in second half, mainly because of what we are lapping then. We don't provide guidance on currency translation, but to give you an idea, if the exchange rate experienced during quarter two hold for the year, it would be about a negative 3% headwind to our operating profit. Guidance for adjusted basis earnings per share increases to a range of $3.65 and to $3.75, which incorporates the higher operating profit and other income that we experienced in the first half. Specifically, other income should retain its first upside before settling back to a run rate of $15 million to $20 million per quarter in the second half. Our effective tax rate is now expected to be in the mid-22% range, only slightly better than we previously communicated. These factors are partially offset by interest expense now expected to be higher given quarter two's run rate and joint venture earnings and minority interest collectively should run a little bit more negative in the second half than the first and we are raising our outlook for free cash flow to just above $1 billion with year-on-year growth driven by operating profit and despite capital expenditure temporarily elevated as a percentage of sales for expanded Pringles capacity in emerging markets as well as usual cash outlays related to our two network optimization projects. So we remain in a very good financial position. Our quarter one and quarter two results came in better than expected, enabling us to raise our guidance for the full year, and we are confident in the second half. We have solid commercial plans that already are improving our volume performance around the world, and this is starting to show up more plainly in our in-market data as well. Our profit margins continue to improve, progressing faster than planned, enabling us to reinvest in our brands and our balance sheet and cash flow remain in strong shape. And with that, let me now turn it back to Steve for a run-through of our businesses around the world. No, I think the only thing I'd add is that elasticities came in better than expected. So while the volume declines were in the teens, it was definitely better than what we had expected in the quarter. I think we need to continue to take some more pricing in some of our other categories. And so I think we've assumed that elasticity would be there in the second half. And we'll see -- we're encouraged by what we saw in the second quarter, but we are being prudent about the rest of the year. So not really. I mean, I think if you kind of look at, and we've talked this previously as well, right, the gross margin progression will moderate in the second half as some of the things that we lapped start moderating. We obviously had the TSA pass through last year in quarter four. So that's -- so we'll be lapping that I think the bottlenecks and shortages, which was a big driver of improved gross margin, particularly in quarter one, I think that's firmly behind us. We saw a little bit of that in quarter two, but it was largely in quarter one. So you won't have that in the second half. And then the country mix impact driven by the naira in Nigeria will also -- you'll start lapping that. If you recall, last year, the biggest devaluation in the Naira was kind of around this time, so in quarter three. So you're going to start lapping that. So we continue to -- we're very pleased with the progress that we're making on the margins. It's coming in better than expected. But we continue to see progression, but not as much as we saw in the first half because of some of the items that we are lapping. So I'd say that's probably the biggest driver of brand building, we saw a good double-digit increase in the first half. That's going to moderate in the second half because if you recall last year, in the second half, we had ramped up brand building. So the absolute pressure continues to be very good. But when you look at it versus the ramp up in the second half, the growth moderates. So I think those are some of the puts and takes in terms of the second half operating profit. No real change. I think that continues to be our outlook to be neutral to slightly inflationary. I think costs are coming in pretty much as we had expected. Obviously, in Nigeria, we are seeing inflation come through probably at a higher rate. But other than that, costs are coming in pretty much in line with expectations. I think the only thing I add is that... The only thing I'd add Steve, when you look at our second half is that if you exclude Nigeria, where we've talked, right, that we expect -- we continue to expect volume declines because of the elasticity and because of the pricing that we're taking. If you exclude that, we pretty much expect volume growth in most of our -- in all of our other regions other than Nigeria. So I think you should expect that trend to continue for us in the second half."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. Welcome to Kellanova's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Planning for Kellanova. Mr. Renwick, you may begin your conference call.\nJohn Renwick: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for a review of our first quarter results as well as an update on our outlook for 2024. I'm joined this morning by Steve Cahillane, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Amit Banati, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. Slide 3 shows our forward-looking statements disclaimer. As you are aware, certain statements made today such as projections for Kellanova's future performance are forward-looking statements. Actual results could be materially different from those projected. For further information concerning factors that could cause these results to differ, please refer to the third slide of this presentation as well as to our public SEC filings. A recording of today's webcast and supporting documents will be archived for at least 90 days on the investor page of www.kellanova.com. As always, when referring to our results and outlook, unless otherwise noted, we will be referring to them on an organic basis for net sales and on a currency-neutral adjusted basis for operating profit and earnings per share. Also, remember that our 2023 results have been recast to treat the spun-off WK Kellogg Co. as a discontinued operation in accordance with applicable accounting guidelines. Those recast statements can be found in our Q4 2023 earnings press release from February 8 of this year. And now I'll turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Cahillane: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Two quarters ago, we became Kellanova, with a more focused and growth-oriented portfolio, a refreshed strategy, more ambitious financial targets and the continued commitment to deliver long-term value for our share-owners. I'm proud to say that we have continued to deliver solid results even amidst challenging macro and industry conditions. Our first quarter was a very strong start to 2024 with better sales growth, profit margins and cash flow than we had projected, and it was another quarter of on-algorithm performance year-on-year; in fact, at the upper end of our algorithm ranges. We are encouraged by the early signs of headway we are making in the marketplace, including here in the United States, and we continue to deliver strong organic growth in emerging markets. Put it all together, and you can see why we are able to reaffirm our 2024 guidance today and with an increased level of confidence. But before we dive into the details of our financials and regional performance, let me remind you of a few important drivers of this performance. First is our strategy: differentiate, drive and deliver, shown on Slide 6. Each and every element of this strategy is being addressed and executed, both to deliver our near-term commitments, but also to build for a strong future. The strategy clearly has us further differentiating ourselves as a company driving the actions that deliver share-owner value. Then, of course, there is our global footprint. Another area of differentiation for Kellanova depicted on Slide 7. Our heavy international presence adds diversification and growth, both of which were once again on display in the latest quarter. And this footprint, with its growth orientation and diversification, will remain a key differentiator for years to come. All of this is driving differentiated results. Slide 8 shows how our organic net sales growth has remained above our peer group median. Recently, we have benefited in part from our ability to raise prices significantly in markets where the currency has devalued sharply of late, but it is differentiated growth, differentiated from our peers and differentiated from our past, and it does reflect the benefits of our sharpened strategy and our more growth-oriented portfolio. Our portfolio is not only more growth-oriented today, but it is also more profitable. Slide 9 shows how our post-spin companies' margins are higher than we were as Kellogg Company even before the pandemic. So as stated on Slide 10, we are again reaffirming our full year guidance, and we are doing so with increased confidence. This increased confidence comes from the over-delivery of our first quarter. It also stems from the fact that our return to full commercial activity is gaining traction, resulting in sequential improvement in key end market metrics. A good example is the U.S., where we saw consumption volume and sales improve their trends in March and into April. Meanwhile, category-level elasticities are starting to moderate, which further supports our expectations for stabilizing volumes. We continue to invest in our emerging markets businesses, an important source of our differentiated long-term growth and we are in the process of adding capacity for our biggest brand, Pringles, in these emerging markets. We continue to restore and expand margins, progressing ahead of our plan in this area. And finally, we continue to enhance our financial flexibility through increased free cash flow and a deleveraged balance sheet. Meanwhile, we also continue to focus on growing the right way and Slide 11 provides just a few examples of our better days promise in action during the first quarter. As always, we had a heavy focus on addressing food insecurity worldwide. But we also know that doing the right thing is good for business. And during the first quarter, we again partnered with customers and leveraged our brands as we supported the communities we serve. We also continue to be recognized for our good work. So now let me turn it over to Amit, who will walk you through our financials before I come back and discuss each of our businesses in more detail.\nAmit Banati: Thank you, Steve, and hello, everyone. Slide 13 summarizes our key financial results for quarter 1. As Steve said, we are pleased to report another quarter of on-algorithm results and the fact that these results exceeded our expectations gives us even more confidence in our full year outlook. Our organic growth in net sales was towards the top end of our long-term target range, with much of this organic growth attributable to pricing to offset currency devaluation. But even outside of that, our sales and volume came in a little better than planned. On a currency-neutral basis, our adjusted operating profit grew strongly year-on-year. If you normalize the year ago recast base, to also include the pass-through of transition services expenses, this year-on-year growth would still be in the double digits on a currency-neutral basis, and it was driven by a restoration of gross profit margin that more than covered increased brand-building investment. Our below-the-line items, more or less offset each other, resulting in growth in earnings per share that was similar to the operating profit and a very good start to the year. Meanwhile, free cash flow is also off to a good start. Slide 14 walks you through the major components of our year-on-year net sales growth. As you can see, our 5% organic growth was primarily driven by price mix, which itself was led by revenue growth management actions taken over the past 12 months to cover what had been rising input cost inflation as well as pricing actions taken more recently in Nigeria to cover currency devaluation. As expected, our overall price/mix growth decelerated sequentially again in quarter 1, and it should continue to do so as the year goes on. Volume declined on elasticity impacts around the world. Sequentially, from quarter 4, our overall volume decline was affected by Nigeria experiencing less accelerated orders than last quarter. However, in most of our other regions, we're encouraged by the pace of what we have always planned to be a gradual stabilization and recovery. Moving along the graphs, the small impact from last year's divestiture of our Russia business will continue for one more quarter as the transaction anniversaries at the start of quarter 3. Foreign currency translation clipped net sales growth by a larger-than-expected nine percentage points in quarter 1, principally reflecting the Nigerian Naira. If exchange rates experienced during quarter one were to hold the full year's currency impact, would be around negative 7%. Now let's look at gross profit on Slide 15. As we've discussed previously, the discontinued operations accounting used to recast 2022 and the first three quarters of 2023 takes into account only the expenses associated with our transition services agreement and not the pass-through of those expenses to WK Kellogg Co. Year-on-year, this contributed about 110 basis points of our margin expansion during quarter 1. Currency devaluations affected our country mix, contributing a year-on-year margin benefit in quarter one of approximately 170 basis points. But as you can see, even without these recast and country mix impacts, we continued a multi-quarter trend of increased gross profit dollars and improvement in our gross profit margin. Driving this margin recovery have been a number of factors, including the improved supply environment, a resumed higher level of productivity and last year's revenue growth management actions against moderating input cost inflation. The fact that this gross margin restoration has continued to run ahead of pace gives us additional confidence in our full year outlook of more than 35%. The same holds true for operating profit shown on Slide 16. This was driven by our top line growth and recovering gross profit margin, which were enough to fund advertising and consumer promotion that increased faster than net sales. The absence of TSA reimbursement from the year ago recast base was a year-on-year impact of roughly $45 million at the operating profit line, which explains a little less than 150 basis points of the margin expansion and the currency-related mix shift had the effect of adding less than 100 basis points of the margin expansion. Even if we exclude these two factors, we still continue to grow operating profit in dollars and in margin and quite substantially. Like our gross profit, this operating profit performance was better than expected, another promising sign for the full year. This strong quarter one margin performance lends confidence to our outlook for an operating profit margin of over 14% for the full year. Moving down the P&L, we come to our earnings per share walk on Slide 17. As you can see, all of our EPS growth in quarter one was attributable to our growth in operating profit as below the line items offset each other. Interest expense increased meaningfully year-on-year, reflecting higher interest rates. This was offset by a similar increase in other income, reflecting currency translation gains. As expected, our effective tax rate came in at about 22.6%, and joint venture earnings and minority interests were collectively about a $0.01 drag on EPS. Our average shares outstanding decreased modestly year-on-year, reflecting share buybacks that we accelerated into the previous quarter. Let's turn to Slide 18 and look at our free cash flow and net debt. We're off to a good start on free cash flow, even in what is normally a small quarter for this metric, though some of this is timing related, specifically the timing of a planned distribution from a post-retirement fund, which is expected to be offset later in the year. Meantime, we've continued to pay down debt even as we return sizable cash to share-owners, mostly through our dividend. Our debt leverage remains well below our targeted ratio of net debt to trailing EBITDA of 3x. On Slide 19, you can see that we are making no changes to our 2024 financial guidance. For net sales, we continue to expect organic growth within our long-term targeted range, specifically calling for 3% growth or better in 2024. Outside of Nigeria, we still assume that price mix growth will moderate as we continue to lap prior year actions, that industry-wide elasticities will fade gradually during the year and that our return to full commercial activity will result in volume stabilization and improvement as the year progresses. The exception is Nigeria, where currency influence pricing actions have continued and where we assume we will start to see meaningful elasticity impact on volume. Organic growth, of course, excludes currency translation which based on exchange rates we saw during quarter 1, would be a headwind of about 7% for the full year. For adjusted basis operating profit, we again reaffirmed the range of $1.85 billion to $1.9 billion. This incorporates a worsened negative impact from currency translation, which based on exchange rates experienced during quarter one would be about negative 2% to 3% for the full year. This operating profit guidance still implies continued margin expansion as an improving gross profit margin more than offset a strong increase in brand investment. In fact, we are taking advantage of our strong quarter one to increase our reinvestment in brands and capabilities. Adjusted basis, earnings per share is still expected to be in the range of $3.55 to $3.65. Interest expense for the year now should be around $315 million versus the $310 million we signaled last quarter and currency translation is running worse than previously expected. On the other hand, other income's favorable quarter one brings up the full year, even as remaining quarters are still expected to run at around $15 million per quarter. We also estimate that our effective tax rate will come in below the 23% we previously guided to something more like what we saw in quarter 1. And the collective impact of joint venture earnings and minority interest may continue to run at a similar rate as in quarter 1. And we are reaffirming our outlook for free cash flow of approximately $1 billion with year-on-year growth driven by operating profit and despite capital expenditure temporarily elevated as a percentage of sales for expanded Pringles capacity in emerging markets as well as usual cash outlays related to our two network optimization projects. Our strong start to the year across all of these metrics gives us increased confidence in this guidance while still allowing some room for potential risks such as further currency devaluations or disruptions in the Middle East as well as the opportunity to add some investment behind brands and capabilities. So in summary, our financial position is solid. We kicked off 2024 with results in the first quarter that were ahead of plan. Our commercial activities are starting to be reflected in improving end market performance and our profit margins are recovering ahead of pace. Plus, we continue to address our future margins and return on invested capital, making progress on network optimization projects, all of which gives us increased confidence in the full year guidance we first provided last August and allows us to increase reinvestment. Our cash flow and balance sheet are giving us enhanced financial flexibility, and we continue to return cash to share-owners, not only in the form of the opportunistic share buybacks we made late last year, but also the increase in our dividend that we announced just last week. And with that, let me now turn it back to Steve for a run-through of our businesses around the world.\nSteve Cahillane: Thanks, Amit. We'll start with Kellanova North America and Slide 22. Our organic net sales were flat in the quarter against our toughest comparison of the year. As expected, price mix growth is moderating as we lap last year's revenue growth management actions and last year's relative lack of merchandising activity. Industry-wide elasticities continued to pressure volume in the quarter, but it is important to note that we again realized sequential moderation in these volume declines and we expect this to continue as our increased commercial activity combines with expected diminishing of elasticities in our categories. North America's operating profit increased substantially as margins continue to be restored. Half of this year-on-year profit growth can be explained by the year earlier recast figures, not incorporating the pass-through of transition service expenses. The other half of this growth was driven by productivity initiatives and year-on-year improvements in service levels and logistics. So in spite of soft category demand, North America again delivered financially. Slide 23 shows how both our snacks and our frozen businesses lapped strong year-earlier growth through the first half before beginning to lap the category level rise in elasticities that became more pronounced in the second half last year. Hence, being flattish in quarter one was expected for both businesses. Encouragingly, our U.S. categories in market in quarter one showed moderating volume declines as elasticities began to moderate. Meanwhile, our ramped up commercial activity is starting to improve our share performance as we had planned. While we returned to merchandising in the second half last year, quality display activity requires lead time, and we are now starting to realize this quality activity with increasing retailer acceptance as we have refined our price points, pack sizes and merchandising periods and events. Slide 24 shows this improvement in two of our most important categories. In both crackers and salty snacks, you can see our upward trajectory in consumption sales and volume, particularly when compared to their respective categories. In salty snacks, Pringles picked up share in March and in crackers, our declines are narrowing rapidly, thanks to increasing merchandising for Cheez-It and share gains by Club and Toasted. The same is true in our other categories. We gained share in portable wholesome snacks in the first quarter led by Pop-Tarts. Eggo started to narrow its share losses in March on meaningful gains in distribution and MorningStar Farms continues to pick up share. So we are gaining traction, and we have more building blocks taking shape in the second quarter when we pick up distribution on shelf resets and innovation launches, all supported by increased brand investment and merchandising activity. And that's on top of likely easing of elasticities as last year's SNAP and other government allotments anniversary. So we fully expect to sustain this improvement in consumption volume and share performance in the second quarter and through the second half. As indicated on Slide 25, there is no change in our expectations for North America only increased confidence. Our increased innovation is beginning to hit the shelves now and our brand building and merchandising have increased and are of higher quality. Best of all, we're already seeing this activity start to bear fruit in the marketplace. We expect our volume performance in this region will continue to improve as a result. Meantime, our margins continue to recover ahead of pace, and we are seeing early evidence of the post spin-off benefits of a more focused and agile organization. And I'm just back from the Los Angeles Premier of Jerry Seinfeld's new Netflix movie Unfrosted, which I can tell you is absolutely hilarious. It's a farcical take on the launch of our beloved Pop-Tarts. Only the most iconic brands merit a star-studded movie, so be sure to watch its release tomorrow night on Netflix. Now let's turn to Kellanova Europe and Slide 26. This region sustained good net sales growth growing organically by 3% in the first quarter even as it lapped prior year revenue growth management actions. Importantly, we realized a modest sequential improvement in volume performance. Even excluding favorable currency translation, Europe's adjusted basis operating profit grew by 4% year-on-year despite last year's midyear divestiture of Russia. Profit margins continue to recover nicely in this business, even with significant boost in brand building investment. On Slide 27, you can see that Snacks, which represent over half of our sales in Kellanova. Europe, continue to lead our growth in this region during the first quarter. Our Snacks' net sales grew organically by 4% as they lap double-digit growth and as we experienced trade inventory timing in certain markets as well as softened demand in Israel, which is the lone Middle East market serviced out of Kellanova Europe. End market, we saw continued deceleration in retail sales growth for our primary categories on moderating price increases and sustained elasticities. The salty snacks category is growing at low to mid-single-digit growth rates in developed markets while sustaining mid-teens growth in emerging markets like Poland and Romania. Impressively, Pringles has gained share across most markets in the first quarter. In Cereal, we remained on a trend of 1% organic net sales growth. We gained share in the growing U.K. cereal market, but did see continued categories slowing and shifts to private label in many markets in the region. Slide 28 reviews the elements to watch for in Europe in 2024. Pringles is poised to sustain momentum as we execute our biggest ever campaigns around football, launched a set of limited edition flavors and continue our paper can partnership with a major U.K. retailer. All while we prepare for the launch of Cheez-It starting in the U.K. in the third quarter. In Cereal, we're excited about the launch of Kellogg's sponsored football camps across the U.K. affiliated with prestigious professional clubs. We're also enthusiastic about building momentum behind innovations like new Choco Corn flakes and Tr\u00e9sor Brownie. The result will be a seventh consecutive year of organic net sales growth for this region even as we progress on plans for an optimization of our cereal portfolio and pending consultation our manufacturing network. Now let's look at our emerging markets regions, starting with Latin America on Slide 29. In the first quarter, Latin America's net sales increased by 5% organically. Price/mix growth is moderating as expected as we lap prior year actions to offset high cost inflation. The good news is that volume declines continue to moderate even in spite of the impact of our SKU rationalization and price pack architecture initiatives. Operating profit declined in the first quarter against strong 20%-plus year-earlier growth. Slide 30 shows our Latin American net sales growth by category group. Organic net sales for our Snacks business dipped year-on-year due to elasticities in Central America and the lapping of a strong year ago quarter. However, end market data indicate that category growth rates for salty snacks generally remain strong, and both Pringles and Cheez-It outpaced the category with double-digit consumption growth in Mexico and Brazil. Our cereal net sales increased by a better-than-expected 10% in spite of lapping a similarly strong year ago performance. End market, the cereal category remains particularly robust in Mexico and Brazil, and we gained share in both of those markets. In fact, in Mexico, we recorded our highest share in the past decade through commercial activation of our core brands and expanded distribution. Slide 31 reminds you of what to watch for in our Latin America business this year. We expect a seventh straight year of organic net sales growth, with growth in both Snacks and Cereal. Pringles growth should be sustained by innovation and distribution expansion, and we also expect good growth in cereal. Margin should improve, reflecting price pack architecture and other RGM initiatives, operating efficiencies and the potential for moderating input cost pressures later this year. And we'll finish with our EMEA region, starting with Slide 32. Currency influence price increases drove substantially all of the region's 19% organic net sales growth in the quarter, and this organic growth was more than offset by adverse currency translation. Nevertheless, our business in Nigeria continues to execute well through this challenging currency environment. It is priced to keep up with parallel market currency rates and has operated very effectively. Up to now, elasticities have remained manageable, though they are now on the rise given the significant pricing we have had to execute. Stepping back, these short-term challenges are dramatically outweighed by the long-term growth opportunity that this growing market and our advantaged assets provide us. Outside of Nigeria and our joint ventures with Tolaram, our organic net sales declined slightly year-on-year as it lapped double-digit growth in the year ago quarter and as demand has been impacted by the heightened tensions in the Middle East. On a currency-neutral basis, EMEA's operating profit grew by 29%, though the extremely adverse currency translation brings this growth down to 2% in U.S. dollars. Excluding our joint ventures with Tolaram, EMEA's operating profit still grew in the double digits year-on-year, both with and without currency translation as margin recovery continues. On Slide 33, the magnitude of the currency-driven pricing in Nigeria is reflected in the accelerated organic net sales growth for Noodles and other. Pricing has had to continue and while volume has held up well, some of this is related to timing of advanced orders in recent quarters that will likely negatively impact the second quarter and we also are prudently projecting elasticities to finally rise in this business. Meanwhile, our Kellogg's noodles in South Africa and Egypt continue to grow rapidly, gaining distribution and share. In Snacks, we lapped a notably strong year earlier quarter, and Pringles is feeling the impact of the conflict in the Middle East. Outside of that subregion, however, our snack sales remained in solid growth, led by Pringles. In Cereal, our organic net sales slipped by less than 1% despite lapping notably strong growth in the prior year ago quarter. Category elasticities persist, though we are encouraged by our sales in Australia. So for EMEA in 2024, we continue to watch for the elements listed on Slide 34. This region looks to extend its enviable track record of consistently delivering organic growth. Noodles remains a growth business for us even as we contend with increased pricing and elasticities. We expect to sustain momentum in Snacks, led by Pringles, though the Middle East situation may slow its overall growth in the region and we expect to sustain growth in Cereal, led by emerging markets. And EMEA's restoration of profit margins should continue. So let me summarize with Slide 36. We're two quarters past the spin-off and already the benefits of a more focused, more growth-oriented and more profitable portfolio are on display. We again delivered continued on-algorithm financial performance that tracked ahead of expectations. Our stronger commercial plans are taking hold with improving end market performance that is leading to improving volume performance and this improvement will continue. We continue to progress ahead of schedule in the restoration of profit margins. All of this enables us to reaffirm our 2024 guidance with an increased level of confidence. Meanwhile, we continue to take value-creating actions for the future including, for example, adding much-needed emerging market capacity for Pringles, expanding Cheez-It internationally and optimizing our global manufacturing network. Simply put, we have the strategy, the portfolio, the footprint and the financial flexibility to deliver results consistently quarter after quarter and create long-term value for our share-owners. And as always, the biggest reason for our confidence is the talent and energy of our Kellanova team who are working hard every day to deliver value for you, our share-owners. And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from the line of Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nKen Goldman: Hi, good morning everybody.\nSteve Cahillane: Hi, Ken.\nKen Goldman: Hi. Just in scanner data. I know it doesn't cover everything. But - and clearly, you're able to perform quite well anyway lately. But just noticing that as we've seen for a little while now, private label continues to gain share in both crackers and potato chips, maybe at a little faster rate than they are in most food categories. So I'm just curious as we - maybe you think about 2Q and 3Q with some of the maybe elasticity fading trends, as you mentioned, maybe some lapping of last year's Snap reduction. So how do we think about you as a category, and private label in the context of that and maybe some of the competitive trends within there?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes, thanks for the question, Ken. We don't really see the same thing that you're talking about in terms of private label. It's been a little bumpy, to be honest with you. And if you look back to, say, 2019 all the way through this year, there's no meaningful moves in private label in the categories that you mentioned. And if you look at PWS, portable wholesome snacks, there might be a little bit more movement there. But I think it's really a story of not much to see there when you take all the noise out, because you do have private label last year spring a little bit more due to supply disruptions, bottleneck shortages. So there's some of that's just coming back to where it was. I think equally, there is in the non-measured channels, as you said, growing faster, so you can't always look at the syndicated data as a complete proxy for our own top line performance because of that growth. And the growth in away-from-home channels as well, which has been very good. So I think not to be - I hope you don't take that as a dismissive comment, but I think it's not as much to see as you might really think, as you really analyze the fulsomeness of the data.\nKen Goldman: It's dismissive of Nielsen, not me. I'll take it that way. But I'm curious if we can maybe broaden it out a little bit, just as you think about lapping the Snap productions, what are your estimates maybe forgetting what we're seeing in private label, just thinking about it more broadly in terms of maybe the lower income, or some of the consumers that are struggling a little bit. Do you expect maybe to see a little bit of improvement just more on a macro basis as we lap some of last year's trends?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes, we do Ken. And you hit it right on the head, the lower-income consumers, as you know and have seen are under a lot more pressure than the balance of the consumers, and that continues where probably as we get into the back half of the year going to be past the worst of that because of the Snap benefits, because of the restoration of having to pay student loans, because of the improving economic environment overall from an employment standpoint and from a wage standpoint. I think we've seen the last of it. So we always forecast elasticities, to be the most challenging in the first half of the year, and to improve in the back half of the year. For us, we're actually seeing a better performance than that. So, if you look at the syndicated data, again, I dismissed it on one hand, but not entirely. You can see that our performance is improving. We're getting back to full merchandising activity, which we had said, so we're moving from really telling everybody what we're going to do to showing what we're doing, and you actually see that in our improvement. So, we feel much more confident in our volume performance. I'm speaking about North America now, even into the second quarter. And certainly, that - we see that continuing into the back half of the year. So overall category, I think, back half of the year improvement for us even sooner than that.\nKen Goldman: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Max Gumport of BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Your line is open\nMax Gumport: Hi. Thanks for the question. First, just on the TSA impact. I think we've got the moving pieces now, but it sounds like maybe it was $45 million to $50 million benefit on EBIT. And then, maybe the $35 million of that was on the gross profit line? Do I have that right in terms of the size of the TSA with the reimbursement piece?\nAmit Banati: Yes. Yes. I think you've got that right. I think the TSA reimbursement was around $45 million, and that split between gross profit and SG&A is about right.\nMax Gumport: And then how should we...\nAmit Banati: I think nevertheless, even if - yes, I think even if you exclude that, we saw strong double-digit growth in our operating profit. You saw our gross margin even if you exclude the TSA, as well as the ForEx impact, our gross margins were up 190 basis points in the quarter. I think from a go-forward standpoint, we'd expect TSAs to continue, to be in that range, but starting to ratchet down in quarter two. As I've mentioned previously, we are transitioning the distribution centers into WKKC. So that process is underway. It's going really well. Service levels are high as we are doing the transition. So as that transition happens through the course of 2024, you'll see some of the TSA costs move directly, to WKKC. And so, that will start ratcheting down through the year. And of course, in quarter four, you'll anniversary that. So that's what's built into the guidance.\nMax Gumport: Great. Very helpful. And then, Steve, you just touched on this. Over the last several months, we've been hearing more and more commentary of consumer, particularly a lower income consumer that is feeling stressed. And as a result, eating out less, and that's only become more, clear through the last several days of restaurant earnings. I think what's not as clear, is whether or not we're seeing this result in the shift to food at home. I'm just curious what you're seeing on this front, and where you think the volume could be going? Thanks very much. I'll leave it there.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. I think you're clearly seeing value-seeking behavior. And discretionary income, the consumers under the most pressure from a discretionary income standpoint are eating out less. I think that's clear. And they are returning to the at-home channels, but they're still seeking value even among that. So you see growth in different channels that better cater or really focus against the value-seeking consumer. You continue to see lower packs - seeking price points. And so, we're trying more and more not to vacate those very attractive price points. But yes, that's exactly what we're seeing. And as I said in the earlier comment, I think in the back half of the year, that pressure will start to abate.\nMax Gumport: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nSteve Cahillane: Good morning, Alexia.\nAlexia Howard: Hi, there. So I think you mentioned at the beginning that the first quarter, was coming in a bit better than expected, on both the top and the bottom line. I'm wondering that why there wouldn't be a guidance raise at this point, or whether maybe there are things on the table that are still highly uncertain. I mean we've just mentioned the consumer. Maybe you could just speak to what you see as the key uncertainties as we move through the next few quarters? Thank you.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. I think Alexia, it really comes down to the simple fact. It's only the first quarter. So there's always uncertainty with three quarters to remain. But it really gives us the very strong confidence that we're going to deliver a very good year. And what I mean by that is it allows us to really think about the best levels of reinvestment that we can do. And I'll give you some examples of that route to market in Latin America and EMEA continues to be really exciting for us. We're going to invest a little bit more in route to market, everything around digital transformation and artificial intelligence allows us, to lean in more than we had planned, and we were already leading in this year in our plans. We can lean in even more on that. And then brand, especially brand building. I'll give you a real-life example of that. I talked about the Pop-Tarts movie. It really is an exceptional movie. And when a comedic genius and icon like Jerry Seinfeld, makes a movie about - full feature length movie about your product, with a star-studded cast, that gives you an opportunity, we didn't know about it, and we're leaning into it. We've got displays going up all over the place. We've got a special pack with Jerry's picture on it, and we've got a 90-second video shot, by Jerry that's airing right now. None of that was in the budget, and we were able to lean in, in a meaningful way to really accelerate the Pop-Tarts momentum. So, we're in that type of position right now. So, there's nothing looming on the horizon that's scaring us. It just allows us to really set up the year for an exceptional performance.\nAlexia Howard: Great. And could I just follow up? Your leverage is obviously low at the moment. You've got this transitional services agreement that's going to be fading down. What's your appetite to doing a deal? I know there's a lot of moving pieces right now. Is it too soon to try to replace the sales and EBIT that were lost with the spin-off of WK Kellogg or are you actively looking at the moment? And if so, I presume it would be in snacking, but would it be domestically or internationally, just curious?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. So we like the health of our balance sheet without a doubt. Our net debt continues to go down. Our leverage ratios continue to go down. So, we have the capacity to do something if it creates share-owner value. And we're always on the lookout for anything that does create share-owner value. So you're right, Snacks is - we talk about being a snacking led powerhouse. 50% of our business is outside the U.S. So, we could do something domestically for outside. We're not really looking to change to proactively change, to be more international or more domestic. We would look at the absolute best deal out there. And we have the capacity to do it. Equally, we're very excited about organic opportunities, which I just mentioned Pop-Tarts, but Cheez-It internationally continues to be a priority for us. Adding Pringles capacity is very much a part of our capital plan this year, building two new factories, one in Latin America, another one in Asia. So, we've got good uses for our capital with high ROIs, but M&A could factor into that as well.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Tom Palmer of Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTom Palmer: Good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to just try to bridge the profit improvement you saw in North America, I think even excluding the TSA contribution that you noted, we'd be looking at almost a 20% increase in operating profit relative to last year's adjusted number. Clearly, the positive pricing would seem to have offset the volume declines. But just wondering on other items, it does seem like investments were stepped up, but the cost environment maybe is a bit more favorable? And then kind of how does that cost environment progress, as we think about subsequent quarters? Thanks.\nAmit Banati: Yes. I think very strong performance in our North America business this quarter, so very pleased with that. I think it's all the factors that you mentioned. So it's the benefit of the revenue growth actions that, we took last year. It's a moderating cost environment. So, we're seeing that play out. I think this quarter, the supply chain performed well. And from a lapping standpoint, this was the biggest lap from the shortages and bottlenecks. So, those were kind of some of the drivers. We continue to expect to see strong profit performance, both gross and operating through the year, probably not at the pace in - we saw in quarter one, because we're lapping bulk of the shortages and bottlenecks, we lap that was predominantly in quarter one. And then some of the mechanical elements like the currency impact was most pronounced in quarter one. That will probably moderate in the rest of the year. I mentioned earlier that we lap - or we anniversary, the TSA reimbursements in quarter four. So, we'd expect continued good performance through the year, but not as pronounced as we saw in quarter one.\nTom Palmer: Okay. Thank you. And then a quarter ago, you guided for all operating segments to report organic sales growth, and constant currency operating profit growth in line with their long-term algorithms? Is this still the case? Or is there any shift here, just given the strong start to the year.\nAmit Banati: I'd say broadly in line with what we do. So no major changes. I think it's coming slightly better than expected. Currency in Nigeria is obviously devalued more than we thought, and the teams there are pricing to recover that. So some changes, but overall, broadly, I'd say, in line with our - in line with the long-term algo that we had guided to.\nTom Palmer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Your line is up. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks so much. Amit, a lot of discussion on North America profitability, obviously coming in and far better than most of us had modelled, even adjusting for some of the one-off nature of things. But I assume there was actually also some element of negative fixed cost absorption or - in there due to the fact that volume in North America has continued to be on the weaker side. I guess, how much of a headwind to gross margin might that have been in North America, or to overall Kellanova that I would assume, would also start to moderate or taper off, as volume trends start to stabilize and/or even improve in the back part of the year?\nAmit Banati: Yes. I think, Andrew, it was a headwind. But like I said, I think the improved supply chain performance more than offset that. So while the volume line was a bit of a headwind. By far, the biggest driver was the lapping of the improved supply chain performance, the improved service levels. And so, I think that's kind of more than offset that. And of course, we'd expect the volume leverage to start improving as the volume trends start improving, in the latter part of the year. The benefit of the lapping of the bottlenecks will moderate, some volume leverage would pick up. So that's kind of the shape of the year.\nAndrew Lazar: Okay. And then quickly, Steve, just - we've heard a lot of discussion also in general about just consumers - maybe the lower income consumer is obviously reacting to just sort of absolute price points, right, being sort of where they are as opposed to anything having to do with price gaps vis-a-vis private label or anything else. Sometimes there's an adjustment period here in terms of consumers adjusting their, sort of their reference price points, with what they may have equated with a product on promotion prior to the sort of the last two years of inflation and whatnot. I guess where do you think the consumer is, with respect to adjusting their sort of their reference price points? Do you think they're making some progress on that front? And maybe that's part of what plays into hopefully helping industry volumes in the back part of the year as well. I'm just curious your thoughts on that? Thanks.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes, Andrew, I think that's exactly right. We talked, I think, in the last quarter and probably the last two quarters about those very reference price points and talking about the consumer will walk by four or five trips, and not just be able to accept that new reference price point. So, I think we're there or thereabout, probably the seventh or eighth inning, if you like. At the same time, companies like us continue to also work RGM initiatives, and it's not shrink-inflation. It's making sure that you can hold your margin and hit a price point, and sometimes that means a smaller size. And so, I think the combination of all of those things working together leads us to believe that the second half of the year, is going to be the inflection [ph] point for the consumer. And for us, as I said, I think we get there even faster than that, because of what we're lapping, because we admittedly came back to merchandising activity perhaps later than we otherwise would have, knowing what we know today. But the fact of the matter is we are there now. We are merchandising more effectively. We've got more quality displays. We like our price points. We do like our price points and where they are with consumers. And so, we see all that leading to a better back half of the year, although still not without pressure. So I don't want to be pollyannish about it. The consumer is still under a good bit of pressure, but I do think that there is brightness on the horizon.\nAndrew Lazar: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question today is from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning. I just want to come back to the big picture outlook for the consumer. And we've touched a little bit already on possibly the food away from home shift to food at home as a possible tailwind. But I guess every company is looking for volume improvement in the second half, even if you think about food away from home shifts adding - growing the pie, private label momentum is still strong. We hear over and over again about the pressured consumer lapping Snap kind of puts an incremental negative in the rearview, but doesn't replace it with any new boost. So, I guess where does all the volume come from? Is it - do you expect private label share to reverse, is it just that other competitors in the branded space will seed share to Kellanova? How do we think about how that's meant to unfold?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. So I think if you step back and look at everything, I don't think that there has been volume destruction, right? If there is a caloric reduction in the population, it is quite minimal. And a couple of quarters ago, everybody wanted to talk about the GLP-1 drugs. I think that's faded as well. So if you start with the premise that more or less the caloric state remains the same, then the volume goes somewhere. And I think those with the best full commercial activation, with brands that matter to consumers are going to be the ultimate winners. And that's why we're excited about where we are in terms of our ability to reinvest, and continue to step up our investment against the consumer and against household penetration. And making sure that we're delighting our consumers all along the way, because we think the volume potential is still very real, and hasn't had any full diminishment, if you like.\nMichael Lavery: And you've touched in the past on potential consumer adjustments in terms of things like waste reduction, just using more leftovers, is that some of the behavior that might refer to prior norms, or that - is that some of the things you're counting on as part of the change?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. I think it's interesting, because you all on this call and we and all of our peers have been in search of where that volume is, right? And there's been a lot of hypotheses. And I think the fact is it's probably a lot of things that are hard to measure. One is managing the household pantry, less leftovers, more creativity. I think all those things have been coming into play, but they're now -- if you think about it, they're in the base, right? You can only work that pantry so long, the pantry is not an infinite supply of stuff in the corners, so that's been worked. But I think this new consumer behavior around less food waste and more - making sure that leftovers are really used is probably consumer behavior as far as we can tell, that will remain. But again, it's in the base. And so, I think there's a normal, if you like. Now as the economy improves, if it does improve, if discretionary income keeps growing faster than inflation, you'll likely see a return to kind of the pre-inflationary times as people become a little bit more comfortable. I think that would be a natural outcome. But right now, I think we see the continuation of that behavior, recognizing that it's in the base.\nMichael Lavery: And just a quick follow-up on LATAM. You called out the performance there being what it was despite the SKU rationalizations that you've had, can you just give a sense of maybe the magnitude of what that was? And are there incrementally new ones we should be mindful of modeling ahead? Or is this closer to winding down?\nAmit Banati: I think it's largely behind us. And so yes - but overall, we're seeing good momentum in our LATAM business, both in Mexico as well as in Brazil.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of David Palmer of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Good morning. Last quarter, I think you guided to 20 for the year, North America snacks organic sales growth, low single-digits. Is that still the thinking? And if so, how do you envision price versus volume this year for North America? Just looking at the last four weeks, and I know you highlighted in the last four weeks, I don't know if that composition is how you're thinking things will play out. But it does look like price per unit is down low single digits with volume offsetting that. And I'm not sure how indicative that will be?\nSteve Cahillane: Yes, David, I think if you look at what's happened in the last 18 months, two years, been too much price and not enough volume for obvious reasons. And now we're seeing the - we're starting to see the reversal of that in North America. And as I mentioned several times on the call now, we're seeing a better volume performance. You can see that in the latest published data. We're seeing a gradual recovery in that. And we are very confident in the back half of the year based on what we see in - right now in terms of our volume performance. So, we like the balance that we see returning to our business, and we have a lot of optimism that, that's going to continue.\nDavid Palmer: So do you think this is going to be one, where we maybe see volume even stronger than net sales in that division. Is that the kind of year, because you're leaning in with high-quality merchandising that's going to lead to some net pricing per unit offset to the volume that you're going to get? Is that fair?\nSteve Cahillane: I would just - I don't want to go too deep into individual regions and volume price/mix beyond what we said, and that is, it's getting a lot better. The volume performance continues to get a lot better. For us, the return to full merchandising activity, which we mentioned several times, is the real driver of that volume recovery. And we like what we see in terms of that balance. We like what we're seeing with the reinvestments in our brands. We like what we're seeing in terms of our share improvements in the marketplace, all those things combining to give us the confidence that we've been talking about.\nDavid Palmer: And just a follow-up on supply chain was a constraint for the old Kellogg's and Kellanova, perhaps more than most companies last year. I know it kept you from doing some of the things you're doing now, the growth spending and - but also maybe on productivity initiatives. Are there certain metrics you could just talk about just year-over-year where you were, it can be the shift on time and in full. But other metrics, including productivity quarter - year-over-year in the quarter, that can give us a sense of how much the supply chain is a big helper? Thanks.\nSteve Cahillane: David, I would just say I wouldn't say that our supply chain was disadvantaged in the past. What we did say is we were perhaps more conservative than others in wanting to keep our supply fill rates at a very high level and therefore, did not return to full merchandising commercial activation as some of our peers did. Our supply chain right now is performing at a very high level, like think about pre-pandemic high watermarks in terms of on-time in full. So that's where we are, and that's why we have the confidence. In terms of productivity, we're back to the type of productivity initiatives that we were pre-pandemic as well. So that's been very, very positive. We announced worldwide a couple of productivity initiatives that we talked about last quarter that are proceeding very, very well. And so, we like where our supply chain is in North America, and we like where our supply chain is globally.\nDavid Palmer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Steve, your line is up and please go ahead.\nSteve Powers: Yes, hi. Good morning, guys. Just a quick one. I guess a follow-up on that prior line of questioning on North American pricing kind of in combination with Andrew Lazar's question on volumetric leverage. As you think about the benefits of volume leverage throughout the year, offset by the price investments that we're seeing. How does that play out on net impact on margins? Is that a net positive and that drag just as we think about the sequential progression?\nAmit Banati: Yes. I think, Steve, there are a number of things playing through in the margin, right? And like I mentioned earlier, right, we're confident that our gross margins will be more than 35%. Within that, there are a number of moving parts. Obviously, inflation, which we set and continue, the guide continues to be neutral-ish across a number of cost elements. So that's playing through the improved performance of the supply chain, is a tailwind this year. I think from a price standpoint, the price/mix is obviously moderating. So I think it's a combination of those factors. Now we should start seeing some volume leverage as the volume trends improve. But all of that kind of factors into the - to our expectation that we continue to see gross margin expansion, not at the rate we saw in quarter 1, but we'd expect that the gross margins will continue to be - continue to improve and be north of 35% for the year.\nSteve Powers: Okay. Very good. And Steve, I was hoping you can talk a little bit more about the Cheez-It's expansion overseas. You gave some snippets - as you went region by region, you gave some snippets about kind of what to watch for. But maybe you could just pull it all together in aggregate and just talk about that initiative and kind of what to watch, for in aggregate as you progress through '24, and we start thinking about further progression into '25? Thanks.\nSteve Cahillane: Yes. So we are excited about the Cheez-It and their international prospects. We've got Cheez-It now in Canada, Mexico, Brazil. We're applying those learnings to the launch in Europe later this year, particularly in the U.K. And the U.K. team is very excited about it. The initial research on product and on positioning is very strong. And so this is not anything that's going to really affect your models per se, because we're taking it in a very pragmatic way market-by-market, continuing to build the playbook. So each next month is more successful than the one that came for it. And so '24, will be the European launch. And then later in '24, we'll talk about additional markets for '25, and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm afraid we have run out of time for any further questions today. So I'd like to hand back to Mr. John Renwick for any closing remarks.\nJohn Renwick: Well, thank you, everyone, for your time and your interest. And if you do have follow-up calls, please do not hesitate to call us. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Steve Cahillane",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Two quarters ago, we became Kellanova, with a more focused and growth-oriented portfolio, a refreshed strategy, more ambitious financial targets and the continued commitment to deliver long-term value for our share-owners. I'm proud to say that we have continued to deliver solid results even amidst challenging macro and industry conditions. Our first quarter was a very strong start to 2024 with better sales growth, profit margins and cash flow than we had projected, and it was another quarter of on-algorithm performance year-on-year; in fact, at the upper end of our algorithm ranges. We are encouraged by the early signs of headway we are making in the marketplace, including here in the United States, and we continue to deliver strong organic growth in emerging markets. Put it all together, and you can see why we are able to reaffirm our 2024 guidance today and with an increased level of confidence. But before we dive into the details of our financials and regional performance, let me remind you of a few important drivers of this performance. First is our strategy: differentiate, drive and deliver, shown on Slide 6. Each and every element of this strategy is being addressed and executed, both to deliver our near-term commitments, but also to build for a strong future. The strategy clearly has us further differentiating ourselves as a company driving the actions that deliver share-owner value. Then, of course, there is our global footprint. Another area of differentiation for Kellanova depicted on Slide 7. Our heavy international presence adds diversification and growth, both of which were once again on display in the latest quarter. And this footprint, with its growth orientation and diversification, will remain a key differentiator for years to come. All of this is driving differentiated results. Slide 8 shows how our organic net sales growth has remained above our peer group median. Recently, we have benefited in part from our ability to raise prices significantly in markets where the currency has devalued sharply of late, but it is differentiated growth, differentiated from our peers and differentiated from our past, and it does reflect the benefits of our sharpened strategy and our more growth-oriented portfolio. Our portfolio is not only more growth-oriented today, but it is also more profitable. Slide 9 shows how our post-spin companies' margins are higher than we were as Kellogg Company even before the pandemic. So as stated on Slide 10, we are again reaffirming our full year guidance, and we are doing so with increased confidence. This increased confidence comes from the over-delivery of our first quarter. It also stems from the fact that our return to full commercial activity is gaining traction, resulting in sequential improvement in key end market metrics. A good example is the U.S., where we saw consumption volume and sales improve their trends in March and into April. Meanwhile, category-level elasticities are starting to moderate, which further supports our expectations for stabilizing volumes. We continue to invest in our emerging markets businesses, an important source of our differentiated long-term growth and we are in the process of adding capacity for our biggest brand, Pringles, in these emerging markets. We continue to restore and expand margins, progressing ahead of our plan in this area. And finally, we continue to enhance our financial flexibility through increased free cash flow and a deleveraged balance sheet. Meanwhile, we also continue to focus on growing the right way and Slide 11 provides just a few examples of our better days promise in action during the first quarter. As always, we had a heavy focus on addressing food insecurity worldwide. But we also know that doing the right thing is good for business. And during the first quarter, we again partnered with customers and leveraged our brands as we supported the communities we serve. We also continue to be recognized for our good work. So now let me turn it over to Amit, who will walk you through our financials before I come back and discuss each of our businesses in more detail. Thanks, Amit. We'll start with Kellanova North America and Slide 22. Our organic net sales were flat in the quarter against our toughest comparison of the year. As expected, price mix growth is moderating as we lap last year's revenue growth management actions and last year's relative lack of merchandising activity. Industry-wide elasticities continued to pressure volume in the quarter, but it is important to note that we again realized sequential moderation in these volume declines and we expect this to continue as our increased commercial activity combines with expected diminishing of elasticities in our categories. North America's operating profit increased substantially as margins continue to be restored. Half of this year-on-year profit growth can be explained by the year earlier recast figures, not incorporating the pass-through of transition service expenses. The other half of this growth was driven by productivity initiatives and year-on-year improvements in service levels and logistics. So in spite of soft category demand, North America again delivered financially. Slide 23 shows how both our snacks and our frozen businesses lapped strong year-earlier growth through the first half before beginning to lap the category level rise in elasticities that became more pronounced in the second half last year. Hence, being flattish in quarter one was expected for both businesses. Encouragingly, our U.S. categories in market in quarter one showed moderating volume declines as elasticities began to moderate. Meanwhile, our ramped up commercial activity is starting to improve our share performance as we had planned. While we returned to merchandising in the second half last year, quality display activity requires lead time, and we are now starting to realize this quality activity with increasing retailer acceptance as we have refined our price points, pack sizes and merchandising periods and events. Slide 24 shows this improvement in two of our most important categories. In both crackers and salty snacks, you can see our upward trajectory in consumption sales and volume, particularly when compared to their respective categories. In salty snacks, Pringles picked up share in March and in crackers, our declines are narrowing rapidly, thanks to increasing merchandising for Cheez-It and share gains by Club and Toasted. The same is true in our other categories. We gained share in portable wholesome snacks in the first quarter led by Pop-Tarts. Eggo started to narrow its share losses in March on meaningful gains in distribution and MorningStar Farms continues to pick up share. So we are gaining traction, and we have more building blocks taking shape in the second quarter when we pick up distribution on shelf resets and innovation launches, all supported by increased brand investment and merchandising activity. And that's on top of likely easing of elasticities as last year's SNAP and other government allotments anniversary. So we fully expect to sustain this improvement in consumption volume and share performance in the second quarter and through the second half. As indicated on Slide 25, there is no change in our expectations for North America only increased confidence. Our increased innovation is beginning to hit the shelves now and our brand building and merchandising have increased and are of higher quality. Best of all, we're already seeing this activity start to bear fruit in the marketplace. We expect our volume performance in this region will continue to improve as a result. Meantime, our margins continue to recover ahead of pace, and we are seeing early evidence of the post spin-off benefits of a more focused and agile organization. And I'm just back from the Los Angeles Premier of Jerry Seinfeld's new Netflix movie Unfrosted, which I can tell you is absolutely hilarious. It's a farcical take on the launch of our beloved Pop-Tarts. Only the most iconic brands merit a star-studded movie, so be sure to watch its release tomorrow night on Netflix. Now let's turn to Kellanova Europe and Slide 26. This region sustained good net sales growth growing organically by 3% in the first quarter even as it lapped prior year revenue growth management actions. Importantly, we realized a modest sequential improvement in volume performance. Even excluding favorable currency translation, Europe's adjusted basis operating profit grew by 4% year-on-year despite last year's midyear divestiture of Russia. Profit margins continue to recover nicely in this business, even with significant boost in brand building investment. On Slide 27, you can see that Snacks, which represent over half of our sales in Kellanova. Europe, continue to lead our growth in this region during the first quarter. Our Snacks' net sales grew organically by 4% as they lap double-digit growth and as we experienced trade inventory timing in certain markets as well as softened demand in Israel, which is the lone Middle East market serviced out of Kellanova Europe. End market, we saw continued deceleration in retail sales growth for our primary categories on moderating price increases and sustained elasticities. The salty snacks category is growing at low to mid-single-digit growth rates in developed markets while sustaining mid-teens growth in emerging markets like Poland and Romania. Impressively, Pringles has gained share across most markets in the first quarter. In Cereal, we remained on a trend of 1% organic net sales growth. We gained share in the growing U.K. cereal market, but did see continued categories slowing and shifts to private label in many markets in the region. Slide 28 reviews the elements to watch for in Europe in 2024. Pringles is poised to sustain momentum as we execute our biggest ever campaigns around football, launched a set of limited edition flavors and continue our paper can partnership with a major U.K. retailer. All while we prepare for the launch of Cheez-It starting in the U.K. in the third quarter. In Cereal, we're excited about the launch of Kellogg's sponsored football camps across the U.K. affiliated with prestigious professional clubs. We're also enthusiastic about building momentum behind innovations like new Choco Corn flakes and Tre\u0301sor Brownie. The result will be a seventh consecutive year of organic net sales growth for this region even as we progress on plans for an optimization of our cereal portfolio and pending consultation our manufacturing network. Now let's look at our emerging markets regions, starting with Latin America on Slide 29. In the first quarter, Latin America's net sales increased by 5% organically. Price/mix growth is moderating as expected as we lap prior year actions to offset high cost inflation. The good news is that volume declines continue to moderate even in spite of the impact of our SKU rationalization and price pack architecture initiatives. Operating profit declined in the first quarter against strong 20%-plus year-earlier growth. Slide 30 shows our Latin American net sales growth by category group. Organic net sales for our Snacks business dipped year-on-year due to elasticities in Central America and the lapping of a strong year ago quarter. However, end market data indicate that category growth rates for salty snacks generally remain strong, and both Pringles and Cheez-It outpaced the category with double-digit consumption growth in Mexico and Brazil. Our cereal net sales increased by a better-than-expected 10% in spite of lapping a similarly strong year ago performance. End market, the cereal category remains particularly robust in Mexico and Brazil, and we gained share in both of those markets. In fact, in Mexico, we recorded our highest share in the past decade through commercial activation of our core brands and expanded distribution. Slide 31 reminds you of what to watch for in our Latin America business this year. We expect a seventh straight year of organic net sales growth, with growth in both Snacks and Cereal. Pringles growth should be sustained by innovation and distribution expansion, and we also expect good growth in cereal. Margin should improve, reflecting price pack architecture and other RGM initiatives, operating efficiencies and the potential for moderating input cost pressures later this year. And we'll finish with our EMEA region, starting with Slide 32. Currency influence price increases drove substantially all of the region's 19% organic net sales growth in the quarter, and this organic growth was more than offset by adverse currency translation. Nevertheless, our business in Nigeria continues to execute well through this challenging currency environment. It is priced to keep up with parallel market currency rates and has operated very effectively. Up to now, elasticities have remained manageable, though they are now on the rise given the significant pricing we have had to execute. Stepping back, these short-term challenges are dramatically outweighed by the long-term growth opportunity that this growing market and our advantaged assets provide us. Outside of Nigeria and our joint ventures with Tolaram, our organic net sales declined slightly year-on-year as it lapped double-digit growth in the year ago quarter and as demand has been impacted by the heightened tensions in the Middle East. On a currency-neutral basis, EMEA's operating profit grew by 29%, though the extremely adverse currency translation brings this growth down to 2% in U.S. dollars. Excluding our joint ventures with Tolaram, EMEA's operating profit still grew in the double digits year-on-year, both with and without currency translation as margin recovery continues. On Slide 33, the magnitude of the currency-driven pricing in Nigeria is reflected in the accelerated organic net sales growth for Noodles and other. Pricing has had to continue and while volume has held up well, some of this is related to timing of advanced orders in recent quarters that will likely negatively impact the second quarter and we also are prudently projecting elasticities to finally rise in this business. Meanwhile, our Kellogg's noodles in South Africa and Egypt continue to grow rapidly, gaining distribution and share. In Snacks, we lapped a notably strong year earlier quarter, and Pringles is feeling the impact of the conflict in the Middle East. Outside of that subregion, however, our snack sales remained in solid growth, led by Pringles. In Cereal, our organic net sales slipped by less than 1% despite lapping notably strong growth in the prior year ago quarter. Category elasticities persist, though we are encouraged by our sales in Australia. So for EMEA in 2024, we continue to watch for the elements listed on Slide 34. This region looks to extend its enviable track record of consistently delivering organic growth. Noodles remains a growth business for us even as we contend with increased pricing and elasticities. We expect to sustain momentum in Snacks, led by Pringles, though the Middle East situation may slow its overall growth in the region and we expect to sustain growth in Cereal, led by emerging markets. And EMEA's restoration of profit margins should continue. So let me summarize with Slide 36. We're two quarters past the spin-off and already the benefits of a more focused, more growth-oriented and more profitable portfolio are on display. We again delivered continued on-algorithm financial performance that tracked ahead of expectations. Our stronger commercial plans are taking hold with improving end market performance that is leading to improving volume performance and this improvement will continue. We continue to progress ahead of schedule in the restoration of profit margins. All of this enables us to reaffirm our 2024 guidance with an increased level of confidence. Meanwhile, we continue to take value-creating actions for the future including, for example, adding much-needed emerging market capacity for Pringles, expanding Cheez-It internationally and optimizing our global manufacturing network. Simply put, we have the strategy, the portfolio, the footprint and the financial flexibility to deliver results consistently quarter after quarter and create long-term value for our share-owners. And as always, the biggest reason for our confidence is the talent and energy of our Kellanova team who are working hard every day to deliver value for you, our share-owners. And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Hi, Ken. Yes, thanks for the question, Ken. We don't really see the same thing that you're talking about in terms of private label. It's been a little bumpy, to be honest with you. And if you look back to, say, 2019 all the way through this year, there's no meaningful moves in private label in the categories that you mentioned. And if you look at PWS, portable wholesome snacks, there might be a little bit more movement there. But I think it's really a story of not much to see there when you take all the noise out, because you do have private label last year spring a little bit more due to supply disruptions, bottleneck shortages. So there's some of that's just coming back to where it was. I think equally, there is in the non-measured channels, as you said, growing faster, so you can't always look at the syndicated data as a complete proxy for our own top line performance because of that growth. And the growth in away-from-home channels as well, which has been very good. So I think not to be - I hope you don't take that as a dismissive comment, but I think it's not as much to see as you might really think, as you really analyze the fulsomeness of the data. Yes, we do Ken. And you hit it right on the head, the lower-income consumers, as you know and have seen are under a lot more pressure than the balance of the consumers, and that continues where probably as we get into the back half of the year going to be past the worst of that because of the Snap benefits, because of the restoration of having to pay student loans, because of the improving economic environment overall from an employment standpoint and from a wage standpoint. I think we've seen the last of it. So we always forecast elasticities, to be the most challenging in the first half of the year, and to improve in the back half of the year. For us, we're actually seeing a better performance than that. So, if you look at the syndicated data, again, I dismissed it on one hand, but not entirely. You can see that our performance is improving. We're getting back to full merchandising activity, which we had said, so we're moving from really telling everybody what we're going to do to showing what we're doing, and you actually see that in our improvement. So, we feel much more confident in our volume performance. I'm speaking about North America now, even into the second quarter. And certainly, that - we see that continuing into the back half of the year. So overall category, I think, back half of the year improvement for us even sooner than that. Yes. I think you're clearly seeing value-seeking behavior. And discretionary income, the consumers under the most pressure from a discretionary income standpoint are eating out less. I think that's clear. And they are returning to the at-home channels, but they're still seeking value even among that. So you see growth in different channels that better cater or really focus against the value-seeking consumer. You continue to see lower packs - seeking price points. And so, we're trying more and more not to vacate those very attractive price points. But yes, that's exactly what we're seeing. And as I said in the earlier comment, I think in the back half of the year, that pressure will start to abate. Good morning, Alexia. Yes. I think Alexia, it really comes down to the simple fact. It's only the first quarter. So there's always uncertainty with three quarters to remain. But it really gives us the very strong confidence that we're going to deliver a very good year. And what I mean by that is it allows us to really think about the best levels of reinvestment that we can do. And I'll give you some examples of that route to market in Latin America and EMEA continues to be really exciting for us. We're going to invest a little bit more in route to market, everything around digital transformation and artificial intelligence allows us, to lean in more than we had planned, and we were already leading in this year in our plans. We can lean in even more on that. And then brand, especially brand building. I'll give you a real-life example of that. I talked about the Pop-Tarts movie. It really is an exceptional movie. And when a comedic genius and icon like Jerry Seinfeld, makes a movie about - full feature length movie about your product, with a star-studded cast, that gives you an opportunity, we didn't know about it, and we're leaning into it. We've got displays going up all over the place. We've got a special pack with Jerry's picture on it, and we've got a 90-second video shot, by Jerry that's airing right now. None of that was in the budget, and we were able to lean in, in a meaningful way to really accelerate the Pop-Tarts momentum. So, we're in that type of position right now. So, there's nothing looming on the horizon that's scaring us. It just allows us to really set up the year for an exceptional performance. Yes. So we like the health of our balance sheet without a doubt. Our net debt continues to go down. Our leverage ratios continue to go down. So, we have the capacity to do something if it creates share-owner value. And we're always on the lookout for anything that does create share-owner value. So you're right, Snacks is - we talk about being a snacking led powerhouse. 50% of our business is outside the U.S. So, we could do something domestically for outside. We're not really looking to change to proactively change, to be more international or more domestic. We would look at the absolute best deal out there. And we have the capacity to do it. Equally, we're very excited about organic opportunities, which I just mentioned Pop-Tarts, but Cheez-It internationally continues to be a priority for us. Adding Pringles capacity is very much a part of our capital plan this year, building two new factories, one in Latin America, another one in Asia. So, we've got good uses for our capital with high ROIs, but M&A could factor into that as well. Yes, Andrew, I think that's exactly right. We talked, I think, in the last quarter and probably the last two quarters about those very reference price points and talking about the consumer will walk by four or five trips, and not just be able to accept that new reference price point. So, I think we're there or thereabout, probably the seventh or eighth inning, if you like. At the same time, companies like us continue to also work RGM initiatives, and it's not shrink-inflation. It's making sure that you can hold your margin and hit a price point, and sometimes that means a smaller size. And so, I think the combination of all of those things working together leads us to believe that the second half of the year, is going to be the inflection [ph] point for the consumer. And for us, as I said, I think we get there even faster than that, because of what we're lapping, because we admittedly came back to merchandising activity perhaps later than we otherwise would have, knowing what we know today. But the fact of the matter is we are there now. We are merchandising more effectively. We've got more quality displays. We like our price points. We do like our price points and where they are with consumers. And so, we see all that leading to a better back half of the year, although still not without pressure. So I don't want to be pollyannish about it. The consumer is still under a good bit of pressure, but I do think that there is brightness on the horizon. Yes. So I think if you step back and look at everything, I don't think that there has been volume destruction, right? If there is a caloric reduction in the population, it is quite minimal. And a couple of quarters ago, everybody wanted to talk about the GLP-1 drugs. I think that's faded as well. So if you start with the premise that more or less the caloric state remains the same, then the volume goes somewhere. And I think those with the best full commercial activation, with brands that matter to consumers are going to be the ultimate winners. And that's why we're excited about where we are in terms of our ability to reinvest, and continue to step up our investment against the consumer and against household penetration. And making sure that we're delighting our consumers all along the way, because we think the volume potential is still very real, and hasn't had any full diminishment, if you like. Yes. I think it's interesting, because you all on this call and we and all of our peers have been in search of where that volume is, right? And there's been a lot of hypotheses. And I think the fact is it's probably a lot of things that are hard to measure. One is managing the household pantry, less leftovers, more creativity. I think all those things have been coming into play, but they're now -- if you think about it, they're in the base, right? You can only work that pantry so long, the pantry is not an infinite supply of stuff in the corners, so that's been worked. But I think this new consumer behavior around less food waste and more - making sure that leftovers are really used is probably consumer behavior as far as we can tell, that will remain. But again, it's in the base. And so, I think there's a normal, if you like. Now as the economy improves, if it does improve, if discretionary income keeps growing faster than inflation, you'll likely see a return to kind of the pre-inflationary times as people become a little bit more comfortable. I think that would be a natural outcome. But right now, I think we see the continuation of that behavior, recognizing that it's in the base. Yes, David, I think if you look at what's happened in the last 18 months, two years, been too much price and not enough volume for obvious reasons. And now we're seeing the - we're starting to see the reversal of that in North America. And as I mentioned several times on the call now, we're seeing a better volume performance. You can see that in the latest published data. We're seeing a gradual recovery in that. And we are very confident in the back half of the year based on what we see in - right now in terms of our volume performance. So, we like the balance that we see returning to our business, and we have a lot of optimism that, that's going to continue. I would just - I don't want to go too deep into individual regions and volume price/mix beyond what we said, and that is, it's getting a lot better. The volume performance continues to get a lot better. For us, the return to full merchandising activity, which we mentioned several times, is the real driver of that volume recovery. And we like what we see in terms of that balance. We like what we're seeing with the reinvestments in our brands. We like what we're seeing in terms of our share improvements in the marketplace, all those things combining to give us the confidence that we've been talking about. David, I would just say I wouldn't say that our supply chain was disadvantaged in the past. What we did say is we were perhaps more conservative than others in wanting to keep our supply fill rates at a very high level and therefore, did not return to full merchandising commercial activation as some of our peers did. Our supply chain right now is performing at a very high level, like think about pre-pandemic high watermarks in terms of on-time in full. So that's where we are, and that's why we have the confidence. In terms of productivity, we're back to the type of productivity initiatives that we were pre-pandemic as well. So that's been very, very positive. We announced worldwide a couple of productivity initiatives that we talked about last quarter that are proceeding very, very well. And so, we like where our supply chain is in North America, and we like where our supply chain is globally. Yes. So we are excited about the Cheez-It and their international prospects. We've got Cheez-It now in Canada, Mexico, Brazil. We're applying those learnings to the launch in Europe later this year, particularly in the U.K. And the U.K. team is very excited about it. The initial research on product and on positioning is very strong. And so this is not anything that's going to really affect your models per se, because we're taking it in a very pragmatic way market-by-market, continuing to build the playbook. So each next month is more successful than the one that came for it. And so '24, will be the European launch. And then later in '24, we'll talk about additional markets for '25, and beyond."

            "name": "Amit Banati",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and hello, everyone. Slide 13 summarizes our key financial results for quarter 1. As Steve said, we are pleased to report another quarter of on-algorithm results and the fact that these results exceeded our expectations gives us even more confidence in our full year outlook. Our organic growth in net sales was towards the top end of our long-term target range, with much of this organic growth attributable to pricing to offset currency devaluation. But even outside of that, our sales and volume came in a little better than planned. On a currency-neutral basis, our adjusted operating profit grew strongly year-on-year. If you normalize the year ago recast base, to also include the pass-through of transition services expenses, this year-on-year growth would still be in the double digits on a currency-neutral basis, and it was driven by a restoration of gross profit margin that more than covered increased brand-building investment. Our below-the-line items, more or less offset each other, resulting in growth in earnings per share that was similar to the operating profit and a very good start to the year. Meanwhile, free cash flow is also off to a good start. Slide 14 walks you through the major components of our year-on-year net sales growth. As you can see, our 5% organic growth was primarily driven by price mix, which itself was led by revenue growth management actions taken over the past 12 months to cover what had been rising input cost inflation as well as pricing actions taken more recently in Nigeria to cover currency devaluation. As expected, our overall price/mix growth decelerated sequentially again in quarter 1, and it should continue to do so as the year goes on. Volume declined on elasticity impacts around the world. Sequentially, from quarter 4, our overall volume decline was affected by Nigeria experiencing less accelerated orders than last quarter. However, in most of our other regions, we're encouraged by the pace of what we have always planned to be a gradual stabilization and recovery. Moving along the graphs, the small impact from last year's divestiture of our Russia business will continue for one more quarter as the transaction anniversaries at the start of quarter 3. Foreign currency translation clipped net sales growth by a larger-than-expected nine percentage points in quarter 1, principally reflecting the Nigerian Naira. If exchange rates experienced during quarter one were to hold the full year's currency impact, would be around negative 7%. Now let's look at gross profit on Slide 15. As we've discussed previously, the discontinued operations accounting used to recast 2022 and the first three quarters of 2023 takes into account only the expenses associated with our transition services agreement and not the pass-through of those expenses to WK Kellogg Co. Year-on-year, this contributed about 110 basis points of our margin expansion during quarter 1. Currency devaluations affected our country mix, contributing a year-on-year margin benefit in quarter one of approximately 170 basis points. But as you can see, even without these recast and country mix impacts, we continued a multi-quarter trend of increased gross profit dollars and improvement in our gross profit margin. Driving this margin recovery have been a number of factors, including the improved supply environment, a resumed higher level of productivity and last year's revenue growth management actions against moderating input cost inflation. The fact that this gross margin restoration has continued to run ahead of pace gives us additional confidence in our full year outlook of more than 35%. The same holds true for operating profit shown on Slide 16. This was driven by our top line growth and recovering gross profit margin, which were enough to fund advertising and consumer promotion that increased faster than net sales. The absence of TSA reimbursement from the year ago recast base was a year-on-year impact of roughly $45 million at the operating profit line, which explains a little less than 150 basis points of the margin expansion and the currency-related mix shift had the effect of adding less than 100 basis points of the margin expansion. Even if we exclude these two factors, we still continue to grow operating profit in dollars and in margin and quite substantially. Like our gross profit, this operating profit performance was better than expected, another promising sign for the full year. This strong quarter one margin performance lends confidence to our outlook for an operating profit margin of over 14% for the full year. Moving down the P&L, we come to our earnings per share walk on Slide 17. As you can see, all of our EPS growth in quarter one was attributable to our growth in operating profit as below the line items offset each other. Interest expense increased meaningfully year-on-year, reflecting higher interest rates. This was offset by a similar increase in other income, reflecting currency translation gains. As expected, our effective tax rate came in at about 22.6%, and joint venture earnings and minority interests were collectively about a $0.01 drag on EPS. Our average shares outstanding decreased modestly year-on-year, reflecting share buybacks that we accelerated into the previous quarter. Let's turn to Slide 18 and look at our free cash flow and net debt. We're off to a good start on free cash flow, even in what is normally a small quarter for this metric, though some of this is timing related, specifically the timing of a planned distribution from a post-retirement fund, which is expected to be offset later in the year. Meantime, we've continued to pay down debt even as we return sizable cash to share-owners, mostly through our dividend. Our debt leverage remains well below our targeted ratio of net debt to trailing EBITDA of 3x. On Slide 19, you can see that we are making no changes to our 2024 financial guidance. For net sales, we continue to expect organic growth within our long-term targeted range, specifically calling for 3% growth or better in 2024. Outside of Nigeria, we still assume that price mix growth will moderate as we continue to lap prior year actions, that industry-wide elasticities will fade gradually during the year and that our return to full commercial activity will result in volume stabilization and improvement as the year progresses. The exception is Nigeria, where currency influence pricing actions have continued and where we assume we will start to see meaningful elasticity impact on volume. Organic growth, of course, excludes currency translation which based on exchange rates we saw during quarter 1, would be a headwind of about 7% for the full year. For adjusted basis operating profit, we again reaffirmed the range of $1.85 billion to $1.9 billion. This incorporates a worsened negative impact from currency translation, which based on exchange rates experienced during quarter one would be about negative 2% to 3% for the full year. This operating profit guidance still implies continued margin expansion as an improving gross profit margin more than offset a strong increase in brand investment. In fact, we are taking advantage of our strong quarter one to increase our reinvestment in brands and capabilities. Adjusted basis, earnings per share is still expected to be in the range of $3.55 to $3.65. Interest expense for the year now should be around $315 million versus the $310 million we signaled last quarter and currency translation is running worse than previously expected. On the other hand, other income's favorable quarter one brings up the full year, even as remaining quarters are still expected to run at around $15 million per quarter. We also estimate that our effective tax rate will come in below the 23% we previously guided to something more like what we saw in quarter 1. And the collective impact of joint venture earnings and minority interest may continue to run at a similar rate as in quarter 1. And we are reaffirming our outlook for free cash flow of approximately $1 billion with year-on-year growth driven by operating profit and despite capital expenditure temporarily elevated as a percentage of sales for expanded Pringles capacity in emerging markets as well as usual cash outlays related to our two network optimization projects. Our strong start to the year across all of these metrics gives us increased confidence in this guidance while still allowing some room for potential risks such as further currency devaluations or disruptions in the Middle East as well as the opportunity to add some investment behind brands and capabilities. So in summary, our financial position is solid. We kicked off 2024 with results in the first quarter that were ahead of plan. Our commercial activities are starting to be reflected in improving end market performance and our profit margins are recovering ahead of pace. Plus, we continue to address our future margins and return on invested capital, making progress on network optimization projects, all of which gives us increased confidence in the full year guidance we first provided last August and allows us to increase reinvestment. Our cash flow and balance sheet are giving us enhanced financial flexibility, and we continue to return cash to share-owners, not only in the form of the opportunistic share buybacks we made late last year, but also the increase in our dividend that we announced just last week. And with that, let me now turn it back to Steve for a run-through of our businesses around the world. Yes. Yes. I think you've got that right. I think the TSA reimbursement was around $45 million, and that split between gross profit and SG&A is about right. I think nevertheless, even if - yes, I think even if you exclude that, we saw strong double-digit growth in our operating profit. You saw our gross margin even if you exclude the TSA, as well as the ForEx impact, our gross margins were up 190 basis points in the quarter. I think from a go-forward standpoint, we'd expect TSAs to continue, to be in that range, but starting to ratchet down in quarter two. As I've mentioned previously, we are transitioning the distribution centers into WKKC. So that process is underway. It's going really well. Service levels are high as we are doing the transition. So as that transition happens through the course of 2024, you'll see some of the TSA costs move directly, to WKKC. And so, that will start ratcheting down through the year. And of course, in quarter four, you'll anniversary that. So that's what's built into the guidance. Yes. I think very strong performance in our North America business this quarter, so very pleased with that. I think it's all the factors that you mentioned. So it's the benefit of the revenue growth actions that, we took last year. It's a moderating cost environment. So, we're seeing that play out. I think this quarter, the supply chain performed well. And from a lapping standpoint, this was the biggest lap from the shortages and bottlenecks. So, those were kind of some of the drivers. We continue to expect to see strong profit performance, both gross and operating through the year, probably not at the pace in - we saw in quarter one, because we're lapping bulk of the shortages and bottlenecks, we lap that was predominantly in quarter one. And then some of the mechanical elements like the currency impact was most pronounced in quarter one. That will probably moderate in the rest of the year. I mentioned earlier that we lap - or we anniversary, the TSA reimbursements in quarter four. So, we'd expect continued good performance through the year, but not as pronounced as we saw in quarter one. I'd say broadly in line with what we do. So no major changes. I think it's coming slightly better than expected. Currency in Nigeria is obviously devalued more than we thought, and the teams there are pricing to recover that. So some changes, but overall, broadly, I'd say, in line with our - in line with the long-term algo that we had guided to. Yes. I think, Andrew, it was a headwind. But like I said, I think the improved supply chain performance more than offset that. So while the volume line was a bit of a headwind. By far, the biggest driver was the lapping of the improved supply chain performance, the improved service levels. And so, I think that's kind of more than offset that. And of course, we'd expect the volume leverage to start improving as the volume trends start improving, in the latter part of the year. The benefit of the lapping of the bottlenecks will moderate, some volume leverage would pick up. So that's kind of the shape of the year. I think it's largely behind us. And so yes - but overall, we're seeing good momentum in our LATAM business, both in Mexico as well as in Brazil. Yes. I think, Steve, there are a number of things playing through in the margin, right? And like I mentioned earlier, right, we're confident that our gross margins will be more than 35%. Within that, there are a number of moving parts. Obviously, inflation, which we set and continue, the guide continues to be neutral-ish across a number of cost elements. So that's playing through the improved performance of the supply chain, is a tailwind this year. I think from a price standpoint, the price/mix is obviously moderating. So I think it's a combination of those factors. Now we should start seeing some volume leverage as the volume trends improve. But all of that kind of factors into the - to our expectation that we continue to see gross margin expansion, not at the rate we saw in quarter 1, but we'd expect that the gross margins will continue to be - continue to improve and be north of 35% for the year."
