At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Randy Bhatia, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nRandy Bhatia: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Cheniere\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings conference call. The slide presentation and access to the webcast for today\u2019s call are available at cheniere.com. Joining me this morning are Jack Fusco, Cheniere\u2019s President and CEO; Anatol Feygin, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Zach Davis, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all listeners that our remarks, including answers to your questions, may contain forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from what is described in these statements. Slide 2 of our presentation contains a discussion of those forward-looking statements and associated risks. In addition, we may include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the appendix to the slide presentation. As part of our discussion of Cheniere\u2019s results, today\u2019s call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP, or CQP. We do not intend to cover CQP\u2019s results separately from those of Cheniere Energy, Inc. The call agenda is shown on Slide 3. Jack will begin with operating and financial highlights, Anatol will then provide an update on the LNG market, and Zach will review our financial results and guidance. After prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jack Fusco, Cheniere\u2019s President and CEO.\nJack Fusco: Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today and thank you for your continued support of Cheniere. I\u2019m pleased to be here this morning to review our results from 2020 and then forgettable year for many reasons, and to share my views on our bright future and why Cheniere is uniquely situated to capitalize on both current and evolving LNG market dynamics. On these earnings calls over the past few years, and even the last several quarters, you\u2019ve often heard me speak about Cheniere\u2019s resiliency. The resiliency of our business model, our assets, our product, and our markets never has the word resilience then more appropriate and when we reflect on Cheniere\u2019s 2020 performance, both operationally and financially. We faced logistical and operational challenges formed by the pandemic of volatile energy and financial market in a historic hurricane season while maintaining our focus to deliver on our guidance. And just last week, a historic winter weather event on the Gulf Coast led to widespread and prolonged power outages and other utility and infrastructure disruptions that impacted millions of lives here in Texas and the surrounding States. I\u2019m heartbroken at the devastation the life, homes and possessions and pray for a speedy recovery to normalcy. As you may have read Cheniere work closely with state and local officials, suppliers, customers, and other partners to manage our operations through the event, moderating our electricity consumption and providing natural gas back into the system to help provide heat and power for human needs. Last week, the critical role that natural gas performs to ensure reliable energy was on full display for Texas, the United States and the world. Any one of these events in the last year would have been significant individually, but to face them all in such a short period of time and still deliver on our promises should leave no doubt as to the resiliency of our business model and more importantly our people. To say I\u2019m proud of how Cheniere\u2019s employees have responded to these challenges is an understatement. The results in financial projections that were reported this morning are a product of the dedication and hard work of the over 1,500 professionals at Cheniere that I am humbled to lead. Please turn now to Slide 5, where I will review some key operational and financial highlights from the quarter and the year. We delivered on our 2020 guidance, which was issued in November of 2019 prior to the pandemic. Our 2020 guidance may be one of the only things I can think of that didn\u2019t change last year. The chart on the right side of this slide illustrates a resilience in forward visibility. The graph plot, total LNG cargoes exported from our facilities by month from November, 2019 through year end 2020, as well as our guidance ranges for consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow over the same time. Despite volatility in LNG cargo production caused by widespread cargo cancellations in the summer, as well as impacts from the pandemic and two major hurricanes making landfall near Sabine Pass, as well as LNG spot prices reaching both record lows and approaching record highs in the time period. Our visibility on achieving our annual targets remain unchanged, a testament to the foundation of our business model and the commercial structure of our long-term contracts. For the fourth quarter of 2020 regenerated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $1.05 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $330 million on revenue of approximately $2.8 billion. We generated a net loss of $194 million, which was impacted by non-cash mark-to-market losses on commodity and FX derivatives, primarily related to the required accounting treatment of our IPM agreements and our forward sales of LNG, as LNG net that curve steadily rose over the course of the quarter. Zach will cover this in more detail in his remarks in a few minutes. Operationally, we exported a 130 cargoes of LNG from our two facilities during the fourth quarter. As cargo cancellations, largely seized with expanded margins on U.S. cargoes as gas prices internationally rose dramatically on both winter weather, as well as market balancing mechanisms deployed earlier in 2020. For the full year 2020, we generate a consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $4 billion within our guidance range and distributable cash flow of approximately $1.35 billion above the high end of the range. During 2020, we raised a significant amount of capital over $8.5 billion across the Cheniere complex in transactions supporting our long-term balance sheet priorities. This is a great accomplishment for Zach and the finance team who navigated turbulent financial markets in the first half of the year and carried out a seamless CFO transition to deliver meaningful progress on some of our strategic long-term financial goals. With regard to our construction efforts at Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi, the facto on Cheniere reputation for market leading project execution continues to be reinforced. As we discussed last year, the construction schedule for Train 6 at Sabine Pass was accelerated with substantial completion now targeted for the second half of 2022. At Corpus Christi, Train 3 is in late stage commissioning and produced its first commissioning cargo in December of last year. Commissioning and startup continues to test and tune Train 3 systems, and we expect to be able to announce substantial completion in the coming weeks. Now turn to Slide 6, where I\u2019ll introduce our upwardly revised 2021 guidance and discuss my priorities for this year. As I mentioned a moment ago, the LNG market is strengthened considerably, especially since our last call in November. And we have been taking advantage of improvements over the past few months, which has contributed to our improved outlook for 2021. Today, we\u2019re raising our full year 2021 guidance to $4.1 million to $4.4 billion of consolidated adjusted EBITDA, and $1.4 million to $1.7 billion of distributable cash flow. Looking ahead to the balance of 2021, I\u2019ve laid out on this slide some key priorities we\u2019re focused on for the year. Clearly, we intend to deliver our upwardly for revised financial guidance just as we had the tremendous visibility into 2020 that I discussed. We have similar visibility into 2021, despite being less than two months through the year, actively reducing our exposure to what has been a fairly volatile LNG market. On the development side, it is critical that our Stage 3 expansion at Corpus Christi maintained its clear competitive advantages. In 2021, our business development origination teams will be working closely together to identify opportunities for further efficiency improvements and commercialization opportunities with the goal of ensuring that we are marketing the most cost effective and environmentally responsible LNG capacity addition in America. Commercially, we continue to believe the long-term supply and demand dynamics in the market today are conducive to long-term contracts progressing. So some obvious preliminary COVID-related headwinds persist. Recent volatility in the LNG market and the rapid tightening of the market towards the end of last year and early this year helps reinforce the value to customers of a flexible, visible, long-term supply agreement with Cheniere. In addition, the market has been responsive to our mid-term marketing efforts. We have recently executed a few transactions in the five to approximately 11-year range. In 2020, we\u2019ll be focused on continuing to commercialize our volumes both portfolio volumes from the existing platform in Corpus Christi Stage 3 volumes. And Anatol will talk more about the current market and our positioning in his remarks in a minute. Financially, I\u2019ve spoken at length about the importance of 2021 as our inflection point for free cash flow. As we expect to be meaningfully free cash flow positive for the first time in the company\u2019s history this year, and based on the improvements in the short-term market, a little more so than we expected back in November. Our capital allocation strategy remains a top priority. Initially, we intend to prioritize debt pay down that maintain the flexibility to capitalize on growth opportunities and will provide clarity on capital return to our shareholders later this year. And finally, we\u2019re prioritizing efforts on the environmental opportunities we introduced on our third quarter call integrating climate into our full service commercial offering. We\u2019ve made steady progress on developing a number of those opportunities, which I look forward to updating you on in the near future as those opportunities are crystallized. Turn now to Page 7, as you may have seen this morning, Cheniere plans to begin providing our LNG customers with greenhouse gas emissions data associated with each LNG cargo produced at our facilities, utilizing emissions data from the wellhead to the cargo delivery point. Our goal is to improve the quantification of the lifecycle emissions for LNG. Supporting the efforts of Cheniere, our customers and suppliers to quantify and reduce emissions across the value chain. Our product is already helping our customers by meeting their energy requirements and improving air quality by reducing traditional pollutants and particulate matter. The cargo emissions tags will help our customers further by enabling them to better manage their emission profiles and maximize the benefits of buying our LNG. Cheniere\u2019s cargo emission tags or CE tags are a significant step forward for this company in our industry as a whole and progress our efforts on each of the environmental opportunities we discussed in November. These tags will provide access to transparent emission data for our cargoes, a crucial step in understanding and managing emissions profiles. Clear transparent data will enable Cheniere in our value chain partners from upstream producers, midstream infrastructure providers, LNG ship owners, and of course, downstream LNG consumers to identify tangible opportunities to drive continuous improvement in environmental performance. Our size, scale, and reach both upstream and downstream of our facilities makes us ideally suited to lead on this front. This represents the first time a major LNG producer has announced the provision of greenhouse gas emissions profiles associated with every cargo of LNG and producers. We are proud to take a leadership position on this important effort, continuing to be at the forefront of the industry as it evolves and benefits all participants in the value chain. Now, I will turn the call over to Anatol who will provide an update on the LNG market.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9. Over the past few quarters, we outlined the exceptional challenges that the global LNG and gas markets have faced, highlight its factors that helped balance the market and underscored our view for constructive market ahead. Today, we will discuss how we wrapped up 2020 on solid footing and share some additional key points on why we continue to expect tightening balances ahead and strong long-term demand for our LNG. LNG market exited the third quarter largely rebalanced with LNG production levels of 6.4 million tons or about 7% lower year-on-year, mainly due to unplanned supply outages and facilities outside of U.S. Stronger economic activity and cooler temperatures in Q4 continued to strengthen LNG demand, which increased 1.8% year-on-year in the fourth quarter and 1.4% for full year 2020 to approximately 364 mtpa. A severe cold snap across Asia in December and continued GDP expansion in China induced the spike in demand and opened the arbitrage window, making European reloads to Asia economic for the first time in many months and driving a sharp decline in LNG imports to Europe. China\u2019s LNG consumption rallied 17% year-on-year to 21 million tons during the fourth quarter, making China the largest global LNG consumer for the quarter. Chinese LNG demand increased 12% for the full year 2020 to about 70 million tons closely approaching Japan as the largest consumer. Japan and South Korea also returned to demand growth in Q4 after two consecutive quarters of year-on-year declines. A previously placed cap on coal generation in South Korea and plan nuclear maintenance in Japan contributed to high storage draws and resulted in a supply crunch that drove daily spot gas and power prices to record highs. These bullets trends occurred amid a supply shortage due to multiple liquefaction outages and constraints on shipping, it resulting in a large LNG spot price increase. In total, Asia\u2019s LNG demand in the fourth quarter rose 13% over Q3 and 8% year-on-year. The region imported almost 260 million tons of LNG in 2020, over 4% or 10 million tons higher year-on-year. Powerful evidence of LNG demand growth resiliency in the region, when considering the COVID driven commodity demand shocks of 2020. The draw on LNG cargoes from Asia and a lower spot LNG availability towards the end of the year, resulted in a sharp decline in European LNG imports, over 30% or 7.7 million tons year-on-year. From winter demand generated a significant draw on storage and inventories ended the year at 74% full versus over 88% at the end of 2019. Currently, storage levels remain approximately 30% lower year-on-year, signaling tighter European balances for the spring. These events in the fourth quarter all contributed to the rapid spike in spot LNG prices and shipping rates to record highs, quickly turning the LNG market from surplus to shortage. While JKM settled December at $6.90 in MMBtu, the increase in interbasin flows, tighter shipping market and waterway congestion drove JKM daily spot assessments for February up to $15 in late December and to an all time high of $32.50 in mid-January. We believe the recent volatility in the spot market underscores the importance of reliable and stable term supplies, the value of a diversified and balanced LNG portfolio, and the attractiveness and stability of Henry Hub link pricing. As sellers were conscious of the importance of affordable prices in supporting LNG demand growth. We believe that our contracting structure and our term contract pricing allows buyers to benefit year-round with low price volatility and diversification for most risks associated with the oil market. We discussed with you last quarter, our decision to augment our commercial offering with medium term contracts. As Jack mentioned, the market has been receptive to this product and we executed several transactions ranging in tenure from five to approximately 11 years on both FOB and Des terms for a total volume of over 4 million tons over time. We will continue to execute on this strategy to opportunistically de-risk our portfolio and enable our customers to de-risk theirs. Turn now to Slide 10. With peak winter demand requirements, largely satisfied and prices moderating, we believe more stable market conditions would prevail for the rest of the year. In addition to improving demand patterns, the market will also be supported by tapering supply additions as the current project construction cycle comes to an end. The LNG industry realized incredible growth over the past four years, adding more than 117 million tons of capacity, an annual average of almost 30 million tons. That average is estimated to drop by over 60% to 11.5 million tons per year over the next four years. Declines in output from existing projects are also expected to accelerate further tightening supply balances. Feed gas availability for exports in some legacy exporting nations, such as Trinidad and Tobago, Indonesia, Algeria and others has been constrained because of upstream reasons or competing growing domestic needs. Our analysis shows that in the next five-year period, supply growth from existing and under construction projects drops by nearly 40% versus 2015 through 2020 period. Supply growth is expected to decline by a further 64% in the 2025 to 2030 period, and new capacity will be required to fill a growing supply and demand gap. Please turn to Slide 11. We expect continued LNG demand improvements as COVID vaccines are distributed and global economic activity continues to strengthen. Longer term and as we highlighted on our third quarter call, myriad policy initiatives and massive guests oriented infrastructure investments have been initiated around the globe, which we expect to be constructive for long-term LNG demand. We also expect sustained growth in the number of regasification markets. Over the past decade, we need to improve living standards across the world along with the technological advances and efficiencies gained in producing, transporting and regasifying LNG contributed to almost doubling the number of LNG consuming nations. We see at least 17 additional new markets that are likely to commence imports over the coming decade, bringing the total from 43 at the end of 2020 to 60 markets by 2030. Each of these markets have different dynamics, but most share common factors promoting LNG demand. Among them, natural gas or LNG is a cleaner burning fuel is increasingly available on affordable, LNG provides a flexible and reliable source of fuel and power generation they can displace polluting coal and help nations reach their environmental goals faster without compromising grid reliability, while also supporting growth in renewable energy. These attributes make LNG indispensable for decades to come, helping nations improve access to electricity, combat pollution and maintain a reliable and affordable energy system, reaching you\u2019re proud to provide a product with these enduring characteristics and remain ready to work with our customers to create practical commercial solutions. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Zach, who will review our financial results and guidance.\nZach Davis: Thanks, Anatol, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to be here today to review our fourth quarter and full year financial results and key 2020 financial accomplishments, our increased 2021 guidance and our 2021 financial priorities. Turning to Slide 13. For the fourth quarter, we generated a net loss of $194 million, which was impacted by approximately $515 million related to non-cash mark-to-market losses on commodity and FX derivatives, primarily related to the impact of shifting commodity curves on our long-term IPM agreements for the purchase of natural gas and our forward sales of LNG. As LNG net back curves steadily rose over the course of the quarter. As we have discussed on prior calls, our IPM agreements and certain gas supply agreements qualify as derivatives and require mark-to-market accounting. From period to period, we will experience non-cash gains and losses as movements occur in the underlying forward commodity curves. This accounting treatment coupled with the long-term duration and international price basis of our IPM agreements will result in fluctuations in fair market value from period to period. While operationally, we seek to eliminate commodity risk by matching our natural gas purchases and LNG sales on the same pricing index, our long-term LNG SPAs do not currently qualify for mark-to-market accounting, meaning that the fair market value impact of only one side of the transaction is recognized on our financial statements until the delivery of natural gas and sale of LNG occurs. During the fourth quarter, as global LNG markets strengthened cargo cancellations largely abated, resulting in adjusted EBITDA of $1.05 billion for the quarter and distributed cash flow of approximately $330 million. We recognized an income 477 TBtu of physical LNG during the fourth quarter, including 453 TBtu from our projects and 24 TBtu sourced from third parties. 83% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SBA or IPM agreements. While cargo cancellations largely abated during the fourth quarter, we recognized $38 million of revenues related to canceled cargoes that would have been lifted in the first quarter of 2021. In combination with $47 million of revenues recognized in the third quarter for the cargoes that would have been lifted in the fourth quarter, the net impact on our fourth quarter financial results was immaterial. For the full year, we generated a net loss of $85 million, which was also impacted by non-cash mark-to-market losses on commodity and FX derivatives, as well as certain non-operating losses on modification or extinguishment of debt, interest rate derivatives and our equity method investments. For the full year, we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $3.96 billion, just above the midpoint of our original unchanged guidance range and distributed cash flow of approximately $1.35 billion, above the upper end of our guidance range. As Jack mentioned earlier, to produce these results in the middle of a pandemic and one of the worst LNG market downturns in history is a tremendous testament to the resilience and effectiveness of our business model and to the tenacity and dedication of our people. I\u2019d like to thank the entire Cheniere team for their hard work and contributions, which have enabled us to attain these results. For the full year, we recognized an income almost 1,500 TBtu of physical LNG, including almost 1,400 TBtu from our projects and just over 100 TBtu sourced from third-parties. 78% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SBA or IPM agreements. Turn now to Slide 14. As Jack mentioned, today, we are increasing our guidance ranges for full year 2021 consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow by $200 million, increasing our consolidated adjusted EBITDA range to $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion and our distributed cash flow range to $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion. The largest variable to achieving financial results within our guidance ranges remains the completion of Corpus Christi Train 3, which is now in the late stages of commissioning. That project is progressing very well and remains on target for completion before the end of the first quarter, consistent with the timing we projected last quarter, when we issued our original 2021 guidance. The significant tailwind that enables us to increase our guidance today is the improvement of global LNG market pricing. And our team has been actively selling open volumes for the year to forward sales and hedges, reducing market exposure and increasing earnings visibility. We now sold over 95% of our total expected production for this year. And we currently forecast that a $1 change in market margin would only impact EBITDA by approximately $50 million for the full year 2021. Turn now to Slide 15. Before discussing our financial priorities for 2021, I\u2019d like to recap some of our key achievements in 2020. As Jack mentioned, we raised over $8.5 billion in capital across our structure through the year, strengthening our balance sheet and executing on our capital allocation priorities. Among the transactions, I\u2019d particularly like to highlight refinancing the SPL 2021 notes amid COVID related uncertainty in the capital markets in May, issuing an inaugural CEI bond in September and refinancing the CCH Holdco convertible notes and a significant portion of the CEI convertible notes with that, preventing over 40 million shares of equity dilution. The rating agencies continue to recognize our significant progress and Moody\u2019s upgraded Corpus to invest in great in August. Now, both of our projects are rated investment grade by all three agencies. And Fitch recently revised SPLs outlook to positive, while reaffirming its existing IG rating. Additionally, we followed through with our debt reduction plan in the second half of 2020, utilizing $200 million of available cash to pay down outstanding borrowings under the CEI term loan. As we look toward 2021, our primary capital allocation priority is to continue with our debt reduction plan and we have committed at least $500 million this year to pay down outstanding debt. Our second capital allocation priority is to manage upcoming debt maturities. Our only debt maturity in 2021 is a remaining approximately $475 million balance of the CEI convertible notes, which we expect to redeem in cash using cash on hand and availability under the CEI term loan. We\u2019ve also developed a refinancing plan this year to manage the $1 billion of SPL notes, which mature in March 2022. We anticipate managing that maturity with a combination of options, including debt issued at SPL that migrated to CQP and debt pay down with cash flow. We have already started to derisk this maturity by locking in and approximately $150 million private placement of long-term amortizing fixed rate notes at SPL that are committed to fund in late 2021 at a rate of 2.95%, the lowest yield bond ever secured by Cheniere. As always, we will remain opportunistic in assessing other opportunities to economically refinance debt throughout the structure. Our third primary capital allocation priority is to provide updated guidance on our long-term capital allocation plan and we anticipate communicating that to you in the second half of this year. As we discussed on our last call, 2021 is an inflection point for Cheniere and we expect to generate a significant positive free cash flow for the first time in our history. And this will give us added flexibility in capital allocation decisions. We are evaluating our capital return policy with our board, and we will provide you with additional information later this year, regarding our path to investment grade across the complex, debt pay down priorities and resumption of capital return via share repurchases and our timing of an inaugural dividend. We continue to view a dividend at LNG as an eventuality, due to the long-term highly contracted nature of our business model. And we will evaluate timing and magnitude with our board and in consideration of market conditions, our balance sheet, the stock price and other variables, including ensuring sufficient capital to continue pursuing economically and credit accretive investments in our brownfield expansion opportunities. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nChristine Cho: Good morning. Can you give us an idea of the kinds of customers you signed the midterm LNG sales agreements with? Were they all actual end-users or were there marketers in there as well? Concentrated \u2013 where they concentrated in any one region and was the timing primarily driven by the events that went on? Where they short LNG and needed to lock in cargoes? Or was it more ensuring a diversity of supply? And if you can also provide an update on what current conversations are looking like, have they slowed down after signing those same or accelerated.\nJack Fusco: Thank you, Christine. And we\u2019re going to have to divide that question up to a few different points. So we\u2019ll start with Anatol. You want to talk about mid-term?\nAnatol Feygin: It just so happens that in this case, the counterparties were end users. The appetite for the product though, I would say ranges across all of the buckets that we are typically engaged with, including intermediaries. So it also happens to be that these transactions are staying in this hemisphere, but there is very broad appetite across both the Atlantic and Pacific basin and engagement, if anything is picking up. These were not done, I would say, against the backdrop of the extremes that you saw in December, January and into early February. These were engagements that we\u2019ve had for a while that enabled us to find the right solution to meet the end users needs.\nChristine Cho: And then the \u2013 like updated, like conversations, have they slowed down, stay the same accelerated?\nAnatol Feygin: No, if anything, the market is continuing on the trajectory of improving, having digested the \u2013 this massive supply wave and the COVID issues. And it\u2019s really staggering to me that the LNG market against that backdrop managed to grow, not the blockbuster growth year, but still a growth year. And what we saw in Asia, in 2020, Asia overall grew 4% in 2020, 3% in 2019. So even though, the market grew more in 2019, most of that is went into the more price elastic Northwest European market and now the market is rebalancing with the fundamental growth that we always expected to see out of Asia. So things are picking up and this event over the winter was quite a shot across the bow, where our customers continue to enjoy reliable, safely priced product and those that thought that relying on the spot market equals low prices, obviously, it\u2019s not experienced that.\nJack Fusco: Christine, I\u2019ll just add, as you all know, I\u2019m an operator by heart and I\u2019m extremely proud of the team. I mean, we have eight trains operating today, as we speak, we\u2019re over 6.2(b) today that has been none to the two facilities, and our debottlenecking and operator effectiveness, efficiency program is working extremely well. So there\u2019s plenty of more from a portfolio supply perspective that we would like to get termed out.\nChristine Cho: Okay. And then for my follow-up, I\u2019m assuming the headline cancellations we saw in 1Q, where due to shortage of ships, due to the extended transit times with what was going on with the Panama Canal and things like that and not because the economics didn\u2019t work. And I know, you don\u2019t comment on cargo cancellations, but theoretically, if this did happen, do you actually have enough ships to have taken advantage of any extra cargoes that might have materialized via CMI.\nJack Fusco: Thanks, Christine. As you said, there\u2019s a range of reasons why customers choose to exercise the feature of cancellation for portfolio balancing and other constraints as you correctly point out the margins were not the issue at this point. And our team does an exceptional job of managing our shipping requirements. So there are opportunities for us to take advantage of those available volumes.\nChristine Cho: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lapides: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Actually I have a couple, first of all, on the new contracts, do those all start immediately or are those staggering over time, meaning some may start here, some may start four or five years from now. That\u2019s question one. Question two is, how should we think about the economics of those versus the existing long-term SPAs that you\u2019ve signed over the years.\nJack Fusco: Thanks, Michael. Not immediately the staggering, but they don\u2019t start on a very deferred basis. So this year and next to give you some color on that, in terms of economics, we think that our product is one that has a fair amount of extrinsic value as we just discussed with Christine and we look to price that into those mid-term offerings. So their attractive economics to us, but obviously on a mid-term basis and are not structurally the types of transactions that would underpin incremental investment.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. And just any follow on thoughts regarding Corpus mid-scale and just kind of what it would take to get Corpus mid-scale to have FID.\nJack Fusco: Corpus mid-scale, we are 100% focused on making sure that that will be the most competitive expansion project in the U.S. and we feel really good about our positioning there. I think there\u2019s an opportunity for us to really move the commercialization forward this year. The volatility in the LNG markets has created a sense of urgency with the customers. And I think we\u2019ll be in good shape on that project. Anatol, you have anything to add to that.\nAnatol Feygin: Just as we\u2019ve said to you guys, we are fully committed to maintaining the rules of engagement on deploying capital, I\u2019m sure Zach will lead to this. And in order to push the go button on stage three, we need to meet all of the criteria that we\u2019ve laid out of return of capital on a fully contracted basis, the types of returns that we want to see as well as the percentage contract, both for the project and for the overall portfolio. But we are quite optimistic that this is the right point in the cycle as this supply wave [indiscernible] and we\u2019ve already seen what the markets can do in the short and medium-term.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you guys. Much appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll hear next from Ben Nolan with Stifel.\nBen Nolan: Yes, hi. So \u2013 well, on my first one, it just relates maybe to Jack something that you\u2019ve mentioned in terms of your priorities. And one of the things that you\u2019d said was continuing to prioritize growth and you were just talking about Corpus Stage 3. Is that \u2013 when you\u2019re thinking about prioritizing growth, does that really equate to Corpus Stage 3 or maybe are there other things that are also serving that bucket that you maybe could elaborate on.\nJack Fusco: No, I think, Ben, Corpus Stage 3 will be one of the most economic projects ever on for U.S. LNG. And as you know, we\u2019ll be able to leverage our existing infrastructure there and but \u2013 that\u2019s a significant amount of organic growth. That\u2019s 10 million tons. It\u2019s like two more trains effectively, Cheniere trains for us. So as you know, we\u2019re finished basically with train 8, we\u2019re doing some fine tuning and then it\u2019ll be handed off to us. Train 9 is way ahead of schedule that\u2019s Sabine Pass 6, and we\u2019ll be looking for 10 and 11. But as Anatol said, we\u2019ll be very disciplined. We have a lot of access and the portfolio that we\u2019d like to get termed out. And \u2013 but we\u2019re very hopeful that there\u2019s a huge demand worldwide for the product.\nBen Nolan: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then as my follow-up, just maybe from a macro perspective, a lot has happened really even in the last few months, we\u2019ve seen this huge differential between the price of Henry Hub and the price is international as you guys talked about, and then you have all of this crazy weather that\u2019s going on and limitations to gas export, and also major expansions from Qatar and other places. Maybe Anatol or Jack, whoever, could you maybe talk through if \u2013 how, if any the market has changed with respect to maybe your customer\u2019s appetite to buy from the U.S. has it improved or not relative to sort of all of the rest of the competition elsewhere in the world?\nJack Fusco: I would say, Ben, first, when customers buy LNG from Cheniere, they\u2019re not only buying flexible, reliable LNG to meet their energy needs, right. They\u2019re buying stability in the sanctity, right, as a U.S. regulatory framework in the U.S. rule of law. So I would say here recently that we\u2019ve seen a increase in our customers wanting access to U.S. LNG and Cheniere LNG more specifically. I don\u2019t know, Anatol, how do you\u2026\nAnatol Feygin: Just to add to that, as we looked into our crystal ball in 2018, 2019 and 2020, we saw the record year of FIDs that was 2019. And then as we\u2019ve discussed with you guys, we saw another potentially record year in 2020. We now know that of course did not happen and even against that backdrop, we were quite constructive on the LNG market medium to long-term. Now we\u2019re in a position, where 2020 saw the lowest number of FID since 97 and whatever is FID now, the Qatari mega-projects were always in our S&P balances going forward. The next two trains of the Qatari expansion are in our balances going forward as are a number of other projects and we still see substantial incremental need to meet growth, as well as to offset the declines in the legacy supply portfolio. We think there are decades and decades of LNG growth ahead of us. And as Jack said, we were dealt a great hand with the expansion opportunity with the track records that our ops marketing and shipping teams have provided and our customers again, enjoy this reliability and price stability that is going to be a major part of lots of portfolios as they meet their energy needs going forward.\nBen Nolan: Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll hear next from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nJack Fusco: Good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Just want to start off real quick with the pre-commissioning cargoes, if you could help us out there. The 22 TBtus, are you able to kind of share with us the \u2013 kind of the quantum of the value there, if that was done into the spot market, that could be a bigger number. And just if you could refresh us whether that shows up in EBITDA or free cash flow, trying to make sure we get that straight.\nZach Davis: Hey, Jeremy, it\u2019s Zach. So yes, I\u2019ll give you a little more insight on that. So you won\u2019t see those figures from commissioning show up in P&L. So they instead, they offset CapEx for the project. So they\u2019re not showing up in EBITDA or DCF. But those were actually the few cargoes that we really left open going into Q1, considering the uncertainty that comes with commissioning train 3. And based on our latest estimates, I\u2019d say it\u2019s adding over $100 million or so of cash flow to our balance sheet, just based on where those margins were at the time. And if you think about our free cash flow, where it does show up, we said that was around $1 billion or so last quarter, we\u2019re comfortably above $1 billion at this point. Thanks to that and the improvements in overall EBITDA.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. $100 million. That\u2019s helpful for sure. Maybe just kind of pivoting over to the storm, and was just curious if you could share a bit more color on what happened there. I think glad to hear everything\u2019s all right with everyone there, but I think there\u2019s a lot of concern in the marketplace with regards to how this might impact your business model, but it seems from what you\u2019ve said, there\u2019s no material impacts there. I\u2019m just wondering if you could expand a bit more, how you were able to do that despite operationally, despite these headwinds.\nJack Fusco: Yes. Well, thanks, Jeremy. And I have to tell you, it was extremely trying time. And I\u2019m looking at everybody in the room, not only on this call, but we were without power, water and heat. I personally for a little over three days and I know Zach was close to the week without any of the three. And so it is good to have 70-ish degrees in Houston today and some normalcy. But we \u2013 when it became clear to us that this was going to be a historic weather event and that, there was a real crisis on human needs for heating and power, we wanted to be part of a solution, not part of the problem. So we actually Corpus tripped offline on Sunday night, there was a power, frequency, drop in the area that took Corpus out. And then things got really cold and very, very fast. So we worked closely with the state and local officials with the upstream producers \u2013 with their producers and with the midstream infrastructure providers to make sure that the gas that would have went to Corpus state in Texas and stayed on those pipes and went to human needs and areas like hospitals and homes. So \u2013 but that\u2019s the few customers that we were going to lift at Corpus, most of them were willing to move to Sabine Pass. As you know, the Louisiana did not have the issues that Texas was experiencing and came back fairly quickly from the cold event, as far as power and water, et cetera. And we were able to load them at Sabine and cover that demand from the customers. So we\u2019ve had \u2013 as I said \u2013 we\u2019ve got eight trains up and running 6.2(b) going to the facilities and we\u2019re back at normal operations.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll stop there. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll hear next from Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse.\nSpiro Dounis: Hey, good morning, guys. Zach, first one\u2019s for you. Just want to come back to capital return mentioned it again and perhaps we had clarity later this year. Just wanted to get more color on that front, not the opinion down, but in the interest of setting expectations, I guess is the plan to announce something later this year with implementation in 2022. Could we actually see something in terms of capital return this year and then just a tag along to that you highlighted several factors that are going to decide that the timing and magnitude balance sheet is one that\u2019s certainly within your control. So just curious what the metrics are that you\u2019re looking for there by year end. I assume investment grade is maybe one of those gating items.\nZach Davis: Yes. So everything I\u2019ll say today is pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve told you and in the previous quarters, but we\u2019ll come back in the second half with a more comprehensive plan to date, we\u2019ve pretty much given you year by year updates. And we see line of sight to finally getting to the nine trains operational in 2022. So when we do come back to you later this year, it\u2019ll be based on that over $12 billion now of available cash over the next five years and how we plan to deploy that methodically for that period of time. But whether a capital return is this year or next year, we\u2019ll give you that type of \u2013 yes, that type of update at that point, but it\u2019s definitely part of the strategy and with having over $1 billion of free cash flow now this year, you can expect that $500 million in debt pay down is the bare minimum, and there\u2019s going to be still leftover money for other capital allocation goals.\nSpiro Dounis: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Second question, just on the medium-term deals that you announced sounds like you plan to continue to contract along those lines. And just wondering, could you just remind us again how you\u2019re thinking about a target percentage of the overall portfolio when it comes to contracting? And then to what degree the agencies have maybe set \u2013 the ratings agencies that is set a lease target for you? Is that also a factor if you approach investment grade, did you want to see a bigger contract book?\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Spiro. It\u2019s Anatol. Just to start as we\u2019ve said to you, as we get into kind of steady state, and have a very good feel for what our ops guys can do. We are targeting 90% contracted for the portfolio overall, and the medium-term volumes will certainly be a portion of that. And as Jack discussed earlier, our flexibility \u2013 the flexibility that we need to maintain with the system and the ability to respond to some of these punches in the mouth means that, that we\u2019re also comfortable with that 5% or so remaining open on a forward basis. So 90% plus mid-term will be a key part of that. We\u2019ve got good traction on that. It\u2019s another arrow in our commercial cliver and we\u2019ll continue to add to that portfolio.\nZach Davis: And I\u2019ll just add, even on those mid-term deals, they don\u2019t change our guidance whatsoever. They\u2019re in our range of what we want for our capacity. But the beauty of it is on a downside case it\u2019s still there, so bringing up the downside case even more so. The rating agencies do give us credit, not maybe in our range of 2 to 250 for the open capacity, but they give us some credit. But basically it\u2019s around $5.5 billion of consolidated EBITDA in a couple of years. And we need to get under 5 times. We have $31 billion of debt. So that\u2019s $3 billion to $4 billion of debt paid down is still the right number, but that\u2019s as simple as it should be for us. We\u2019ll just complete the trains and follow through with capital allocation.\nSpiro Dounis: Got it. Thanks for the time guys. Do well.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll hear next from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nAnya Shelekhin: Hey guys, this is Anya filling in for Julien. So I was just wondering, what drives a high versus a low under the new 2021 guidance range, just asking because you reduce the EBITDA sensitivity $250 million for a dollar exchange in marketing margin, but then you maintain that $300 million range for guidance. What other variables are there aside from Corpus timing that could impact the high versus the low ends?\nZach Davis: Sure. I think it\u2019s just consistency that we keep a $300 million range. I mean it\u2019s less than 10% of the overall EBITDA, but you can assume that it\u2019s around the midpoint of that range. And again, we\u2019re literally less than two months into the year and we raised our guidance by $200 million and that\u2019s really thanks to the CMI team of locking in more of those cargoes, meaning that we\u2019re over 95% contracted. And then obviously our E&C and operations team getting ready to bring Train 3 to operations, but the variables are, we\u2019re still in commissioning. We still have 50 TBtu open. And we\u2019re going to really have to just see how the year plays out and we can give you more precise guidance in future quarters.\nAnya Shelekhin: Okay. Thanks. Just wanted to make sure I wasn\u2019t missing anything there. And then a second as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about debottlenecking efforts. I think your latest update is in 4.9 million to 5.1 million in TPA per train of your target. Could you talk a little bit more about opportunities there and then you can expect to get so sort of a full run rate impact? And is there upside to that advance?\nJack Fusco: There is upside to it. So the first guidance that we gave was based on a lot of low-hanging fruit without additional investments in the infrastructure. And now we\u2019ll be evaluating Anya, what \u2013 when investments that, that we would like to make to the existing facilities to possibly get more output out of them. So there\u2019ll be more to come on that, but we\u2019ll \u2013 it\u2019ll be in lockstep with our guidance and our capital allocation discussions.\nAnya Shelekhin: Okay, sounds good. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll hear next from Sean Morgan with Evercore.\nSean Morgan: Hi guys, just going back to this new CE tags that you introduced on Slide 7. I see \u2013 this is CO2 mitigation solutions. I\u2019m wondering, is that actively capturing carbon in storage or is that still under investigation? And if you looked into that at all, what sort of price would that imply and how do you kind of put that in the context of offering a solution that as you mentioned at Corpus Christi Stage 3 that\u2019s going to be the most competitive in the U.S. and sort of balancing those two factors.\nJack Fusco: There is a whole lot in that question that you probably didn\u2019t realize, but the first one was the CE tags are different than carbon sequestration. So the CE tags are our ability to basically give a carbon footprint per specific cargo to our customer. So every time that a Cheniere cargo either is purchased FOB, so at that flange, or whether it\u2019s delivered that there will be a carbon footprint of what the carbon the CO2 equivalent offsets need to be for that carbon to make it carbon neutral, okay. That tag it\u2019s not as easy as it sounds right. We today on the 6.2(b) that we bought today, we bought from 68 different counterparties on 15 different pipelines. So that is not an easy exercise, right. Because as you know, every producer, every pipe maybe has a little different footprint, carbon footprint, and we hope over time that we\u2019re going to get better and better at these tags. And then our customers will be able to see more transparently how we\u2019re calculating it, and what\u2019s all encompassed in it and then we can start managing it more appropriately, the different lifecycle elements of the value chain of LNG. So that\u2019s the announcement with the carbon tags or the CE tags, or the cargo tags or the CE tags that we announced this morning. We are constantly evaluating other improvements to our overall emission profile. Carbon sequestration is one of them. As you may or may not know, Stage 3 at Corpus Christi is electric driven compression, not gas driven compression. So its emissions profile looks a lot different than our existing trains. If we buy renewables power to back up the power consumption there that that profile looks significantly better. So we are constantly evaluating how we can make ourselves more environmentally friendly to make the product more sustainable. And get to where people are talking about now gas and LNG as what we believe, which is a part of the solution overall. So did I answer the question for you or wasn\u2019t?\nSean Morgan: Yes, I think that\u2019s helpful. I mean I guess so we probably haven\u2019t got to the stage yet where you\u2019re just monitoring and figuring out how to basically explain to your customers the total carbon emissions chain, but haven\u2019t priced out necessarily any mitigation yet, because its still in the early stages.\nJack Fusco: Yes. Yes, there\u2019s a \u2013 we got to walk before we can run. There\u2019s a lot of misinformation out there. The initial lifecycle analysis that was done in 2014 from the National Energy Technology Laboratory has numbers that are quite a bit higher than what we think our actual carbon emissions or greenhouse gas emissions profile really is. So we want to make sure that, that we get the right information out there as soon as we possibly can.\nSean Morgan: Yes, yes. I certainly don\u2019t want to take anything away from this effort, because it\u2019s unique and I think it\u2019s going to help everyone in the marketplace. So and then just really quick follow-up, on the bonds, obviously that\u2019s a pretty impressive 2.95% print. Are you seeing similar excitement on the project finance side beyond just refinancing for Phase 3 in terms you might be able to improve upon previous FIDs?\nJack Fusco: Absolutely. I think a questioning, if we can raise attractive project financing or term loans for Stage 3, yes, that \u2013 to say that we\u2019re confident on that is an understatement considering we went through the pandemic and raised over $2.5 billion at pretty attractive rates last year. So that won\u2019t hold us back. That goes with having a bank group of 40 plus banks have supported us for almost a decade and obviously all the capital markets activity that we do to keep on bringing them down and manage their exposures.\nSean Morgan: Okay. Thanks, Jack.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a one point of clarification on the guidance that the increase in 2021 guidance, is that driven by the newly signed mid-term deals, or have you just locked in more cargoes for the coming year via CMI. Or I guess if it\u2019s a both, can you give us a rough sense of the relative contributions? Thanks.\nJack Fusco: It\u2019s really the latter and the CMI just went to work on hedging as the market went up and putting a like physical cargoes to bed, but fixed prices. There are a few cargoes in there from the medium-term deals. But majority, it was really CMI, yes, being quite active, literally starting the day we gave guidance last year.\nMichael Blum: Great. That\u2019s all I had.\nJack Fusco: Thank you, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll hear next from Alex Kania with Wolfe Research.\nAlex Kania: Hi, I guess a follow-up question on the carbon tag. I guess do you think just high level that it\u2019s a competitive type of disclosure relative to maybe what other alternatives LNG sources globally might be? So as a competitive edge, or is this a sense to try to get more transparency? And then I guess the second question would just be any kind of sense early on in the Biden Administration about kind of changes in tone on trade policy or whatnot. And I\u2019m just thinking about again that to potential market for China. I know of course you did a little bit late last year, but just curious if that\u2019s an avenue that might seem more open now than before.\nJack Fusco: Okay. So first I do view this as a competitive advantage for us. I think there\u2019s a lot of misinformation out there of what are the emissions profile for U.S. LNG. And I think as we begin to discuss in international workshops, what are our methodology and we try to make it more transparent. So if we put everybody else on the same level playing field, I think we\u2019re going to find out that U.S. LNG can be very competitive and Cheniere\u2019s LNG extremely competitive worldwide in helping with some of these countries environmental aspirations. In regards to President Biden, we\u2019re \u2013 we have very strong relationships. Cheniere does in China already. And in all of Asia, we have a great office there. We\u2019ve sold quite a few cargoes here recently on the spot market to China. And we\u2019re hopeful that, that the relationship between the two countries continue to improve. And hopefully we\u2019ll be back at the table for more long-term contracting and capabilities. You have anything to add Anatol?\nAlex Kania: Thank you.\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Just to you see the numbers for China 21 million tons in the fourth quarter continues to be the primary engine of LNG markets growth. And as Jack said, we have a terrific commercial engagement and everything we see today from the administration is supportive of LNG exports. And of course, we received their export licenses when President Biden was Vice President Biden. So expect good opportunities ahead.\nAlex Kania: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now take our final question from Jason Gabelman with Cowen .\nJason Gabelman: Yes. I just wanted to clarify one point of the 90% plus that you want to turn up across the portfolio. How much is left to turn up after you sign this 4 million tons of a mid-term contracts?\nAnatol Feygin:\n. :\nZach Davis: Yes. And in terms of run rate, we were around 85% contracted. Maybe this gets us to 86. But that that\u2019s about it. There\u2019s still a million tons we want to lock up.\nJason Gabelman: Great, thanks.\nJack Fusco: Thanks, Jason, and thanks, everybody for your interest in Cheniere. Be safe.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Anatol Feygin",
            "content": "Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9. Over the past few quarters, we outlined the exceptional challenges that the global LNG and gas markets have faced, highlight its factors that helped balance the market and underscored our view for constructive market ahead. Today, we will discuss how we wrapped up 2020 on solid footing and share some additional key points on why we continue to expect tightening balances ahead and strong long-term demand for our LNG. LNG market exited the third quarter largely rebalanced with LNG production levels of 6.4 million tons or about 7% lower year-on-year, mainly due to unplanned supply outages and facilities outside of U.S. Stronger economic activity and cooler temperatures in Q4 continued to strengthen LNG demand, which increased 1.8% year-on-year in the fourth quarter and 1.4% for full year 2020 to approximately 364 mtpa. A severe cold snap across Asia in December and continued GDP expansion in China induced the spike in demand and opened the arbitrage window, making European reloads to Asia economic for the first time in many months and driving a sharp decline in LNG imports to Europe. China's LNG consumption rallied 17% year-on-year to 21 million tons during the fourth quarter, making China the largest global LNG consumer for the quarter. Chinese LNG demand increased 12% for the full year 2020 to about 70 million tons closely approaching Japan as the largest consumer. Japan and South Korea also returned to demand growth in Q4 after two consecutive quarters of year-on-year declines. A previously placed cap on coal generation in South Korea and plan nuclear maintenance in Japan contributed to high storage draws and resulted in a supply crunch that drove daily spot gas and power prices to record highs. These bullets trends occurred amid a supply shortage due to multiple liquefaction outages and constraints on shipping, it resulting in a large LNG spot price increase. In total, Asia's LNG demand in the fourth quarter rose 13% over Q3 and 8% year-on-year. The region imported almost 260 million tons of LNG in 2020, over 4% or 10 million tons higher year-on-year. Powerful evidence of LNG demand growth resiliency in the region, when considering the COVID driven commodity demand shocks of 2020. The draw on LNG cargoes from Asia and a lower spot LNG availability towards the end of the year, resulted in a sharp decline in European LNG imports, over 30% or 7.7 million tons year-on-year. From winter demand generated a significant draw on storage and inventories ended the year at 74% full versus over 88% at the end of 2019. Currently, storage levels remain approximately 30% lower year-on-year, signaling tighter European balances for the spring. These events in the fourth quarter all contributed to the rapid spike in spot LNG prices and shipping rates to record highs, quickly turning the LNG market from surplus to shortage. While JKM settled December at $6.90 in MMBtu, the increase in interbasin flows, tighter shipping market and waterway congestion drove JKM daily spot assessments for February up to $15 in late December and to an all time high of $32.50 in mid-January. We believe the recent volatility in the spot market underscores the importance of reliable and stable term supplies, the value of a diversified and balanced LNG portfolio, and the attractiveness and stability of Henry Hub link pricing. As sellers were conscious of the importance of affordable prices in supporting LNG demand growth. We believe that our contracting structure and our term contract pricing allows buyers to benefit year-round with low price volatility and diversification for most risks associated with the oil market. We discussed with you last quarter, our decision to augment our commercial offering with medium term contracts. As Jack mentioned, the market has been receptive to this product and we executed several transactions ranging in tenure from five to approximately 11 years on both FOB and Des terms for a total volume of over 4 million tons over time. We will continue to execute on this strategy to opportunistically de-risk our portfolio and enable our customers to de-risk theirs. Turn now to Slide 10. With peak winter demand requirements, largely satisfied and prices moderating, we believe more stable market conditions would prevail for the rest of the year. In addition to improving demand patterns, the market will also be supported by tapering supply additions as the current project construction cycle comes to an end. The LNG industry realized incredible growth over the past four years, adding more than 117 million tons of capacity, an annual average of almost 30 million tons. That average is estimated to drop by over 60% to 11.5 million tons per year over the next four years. Declines in output from existing projects are also expected to accelerate further tightening supply balances. Feed gas availability for exports in some legacy exporting nations, such as Trinidad and Tobago, Indonesia, Algeria and others has been constrained because of upstream reasons or competing growing domestic needs. Our analysis shows that in the next five-year period, supply growth from existing and under construction projects drops by nearly 40% versus 2015 through 2020 period. Supply growth is expected to decline by a further 64% in the 2025 to 2030 period, and new capacity will be required to fill a growing supply and demand gap. Please turn to Slide 11. We expect continued LNG demand improvements as COVID vaccines are distributed and global economic activity continues to strengthen. Longer term and as we highlighted on our third quarter call, myriad policy initiatives and massive guests oriented infrastructure investments have been initiated around the globe, which we expect to be constructive for long-term LNG demand. We also expect sustained growth in the number of regasification markets. Over the past decade, we need to improve living standards across the world along with the technological advances and efficiencies gained in producing, transporting and regasifying LNG contributed to almost doubling the number of LNG consuming nations. We see at least 17 additional new markets that are likely to commence imports over the coming decade, bringing the total from 43 at the end of 2020 to 60 markets by 2030. Each of these markets have different dynamics, but most share common factors promoting LNG demand. Among them, natural gas or LNG is a cleaner burning fuel is increasingly available on affordable, LNG provides a flexible and reliable source of fuel and power generation they can displace polluting coal and help nations reach their environmental goals faster without compromising grid reliability, while also supporting growth in renewable energy. These attributes make LNG indispensable for decades to come, helping nations improve access to electricity, combat pollution and maintain a reliable and affordable energy system, reaching you're proud to provide a product with these enduring characteristics and remain ready to work with our customers to create practical commercial solutions. And now I'll turn the call over to Zach, who will review our financial results and guidance. It just so happens that in this case, the counterparties were end users. The appetite for the product though, I would say ranges across all of the buckets that we are typically engaged with, including intermediaries. So it also happens to be that these transactions are staying in this hemisphere, but there is very broad appetite across both the Atlantic and Pacific basin and engagement, if anything is picking up. These were not done, I would say, against the backdrop of the extremes that you saw in December, January and into early February. These were engagements that we've had for a while that enabled us to find the right solution to meet the end users needs. No, if anything, the market is continuing on the trajectory of improving, having digested the \u2013 this massive supply wave and the COVID issues. And it's really staggering to me that the LNG market against that backdrop managed to grow, not the blockbuster growth year, but still a growth year. And what we saw in Asia, in 2020, Asia overall grew 4% in 2020, 3% in 2019. So even though, the market grew more in 2019, most of that is went into the more price elastic Northwest European market and now the market is rebalancing with the fundamental growth that we always expected to see out of Asia. So things are picking up and this event over the winter was quite a shot across the bow, where our customers continue to enjoy reliable, safely priced product and those that thought that relying on the spot market equals low prices, obviously, it's not experienced that. Just as we've said to you guys, we are fully committed to maintaining the rules of engagement on deploying capital, I'm sure Zach will lead to this. And in order to push the go button on stage three, we need to meet all of the criteria that we've laid out of return of capital on a fully contracted basis, the types of returns that we want to see as well as the percentage contract, both for the project and for the overall portfolio. But we are quite optimistic that this is the right point in the cycle as this supply wave [indiscernible] and we've already seen what the markets can do in the short and medium-term. Just to add to that, as we looked into our crystal ball in 2018, 2019 and 2020, we saw the record year of FIDs that was 2019. And then as we've discussed with you guys, we saw another potentially record year in 2020. We now know that of course did not happen and even against that backdrop, we were quite constructive on the LNG market medium to long-term. Now we're in a position, where 2020 saw the lowest number of FID since 97 and whatever is FID now, the Qatari mega-projects were always in our S&P balances going forward. The next two trains of the Qatari expansion are in our balances going forward as are a number of other projects and we still see substantial incremental need to meet growth, as well as to offset the declines in the legacy supply portfolio. We think there are decades and decades of LNG growth ahead of us. And as Jack said, we were dealt a great hand with the expansion opportunity with the track records that our ops marketing and shipping teams have provided and our customers again, enjoy this reliability and price stability that is going to be a major part of lots of portfolios as they meet their energy needs going forward. Thanks, Spiro. It's Anatol. Just to start as we've said to you, as we get into kind of steady state, and have a very good feel for what our ops guys can do. We are targeting 90% contracted for the portfolio overall, and the medium-term volumes will certainly be a portion of that. And as Jack discussed earlier, our flexibility \u2013 the flexibility that we need to maintain with the system and the ability to respond to some of these punches in the mouth means that, that we're also comfortable with that 5% or so remaining open on a forward basis. So 90% plus mid-term will be a key part of that. We've got good traction on that. It's another arrow in our commercial cliver and we'll continue to add to that portfolio. Yes. Just to you see the numbers for China 21 million tons in the fourth quarter continues to be the primary engine of LNG markets growth. And as Jack said, we have a terrific commercial engagement and everything we see today from the administration is supportive of LNG exports. And of course, we received their export licenses when President Biden was Vice President Biden. So expect good opportunities ahead. .:Zach Davis: Yes. And in terms of run rate, we were around 85% contracted. Maybe this gets us to 86. But that that's about it. There's still a million tons we want to lock up."

            "name": "Jack Fusco",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today and thank you for your continued support of Cheniere. I'm pleased to be here this morning to review our results from 2020 and then forgettable year for many reasons, and to share my views on our bright future and why Cheniere is uniquely situated to capitalize on both current and evolving LNG market dynamics. On these earnings calls over the past few years, and even the last several quarters, you've often heard me speak about Cheniere's resiliency. The resiliency of our business model, our assets, our product, and our markets never has the word resilience then more appropriate and when we reflect on Cheniere's 2020 performance, both operationally and financially. We faced logistical and operational challenges formed by the pandemic of volatile energy and financial market in a historic hurricane season while maintaining our focus to deliver on our guidance. And just last week, a historic winter weather event on the Gulf Coast led to widespread and prolonged power outages and other utility and infrastructure disruptions that impacted millions of lives here in Texas and the surrounding States. I'm heartbroken at the devastation the life, homes and possessions and pray for a speedy recovery to normalcy. As you may have read Cheniere work closely with state and local officials, suppliers, customers, and other partners to manage our operations through the event, moderating our electricity consumption and providing natural gas back into the system to help provide heat and power for human needs. Last week, the critical role that natural gas performs to ensure reliable energy was on full display for Texas, the United States and the world. Any one of these events in the last year would have been significant individually, but to face them all in such a short period of time and still deliver on our promises should leave no doubt as to the resiliency of our business model and more importantly our people. To say I'm proud of how Cheniere's employees have responded to these challenges is an understatement. The results in financial projections that were reported this morning are a product of the dedication and hard work of the over 1,500 professionals at Cheniere that I am humbled to lead. Please turn now to Slide 5, where I will review some key operational and financial highlights from the quarter and the year. We delivered on our 2020 guidance, which was issued in November of 2019 prior to the pandemic. Our 2020 guidance may be one of the only things I can think of that didn't change last year. The chart on the right side of this slide illustrates a resilience in forward visibility. The graph plot, total LNG cargoes exported from our facilities by month from November, 2019 through year end 2020, as well as our guidance ranges for consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow over the same time. Despite volatility in LNG cargo production caused by widespread cargo cancellations in the summer, as well as impacts from the pandemic and two major hurricanes making landfall near Sabine Pass, as well as LNG spot prices reaching both record lows and approaching record highs in the time period. Our visibility on achieving our annual targets remain unchanged, a testament to the foundation of our business model and the commercial structure of our long-term contracts. For the fourth quarter of 2020 regenerated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $1.05 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $330 million on revenue of approximately $2.8 billion. We generated a net loss of $194 million, which was impacted by non-cash mark-to-market losses on commodity and FX derivatives, primarily related to the required accounting treatment of our IPM agreements and our forward sales of LNG, as LNG net that curve steadily rose over the course of the quarter. Zach will cover this in more detail in his remarks in a few minutes. Operationally, we exported a 130 cargoes of LNG from our two facilities during the fourth quarter. As cargo cancellations, largely seized with expanded margins on U.S. cargoes as gas prices internationally rose dramatically on both winter weather, as well as market balancing mechanisms deployed earlier in 2020. For the full year 2020, we generate a consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $4 billion within our guidance range and distributable cash flow of approximately $1.35 billion above the high end of the range. During 2020, we raised a significant amount of capital over $8.5 billion across the Cheniere complex in transactions supporting our long-term balance sheet priorities. This is a great accomplishment for Zach and the finance team who navigated turbulent financial markets in the first half of the year and carried out a seamless CFO transition to deliver meaningful progress on some of our strategic long-term financial goals. With regard to our construction efforts at Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi, the facto on Cheniere reputation for market leading project execution continues to be reinforced. As we discussed last year, the construction schedule for Train 6 at Sabine Pass was accelerated with substantial completion now targeted for the second half of 2022. At Corpus Christi, Train 3 is in late stage commissioning and produced its first commissioning cargo in December of last year. Commissioning and startup continues to test and tune Train 3 systems, and we expect to be able to announce substantial completion in the coming weeks. Now turn to Slide 6, where I'll introduce our upwardly revised 2021 guidance and discuss my priorities for this year. As I mentioned a moment ago, the LNG market is strengthened considerably, especially since our last call in November. And we have been taking advantage of improvements over the past few months, which has contributed to our improved outlook for 2021. Today, we're raising our full year 2021 guidance to $4.1 million to $4.4 billion of consolidated adjusted EBITDA, and $1.4 million to $1.7 billion of distributable cash flow. Looking ahead to the balance of 2021, I've laid out on this slide some key priorities we're focused on for the year. Clearly, we intend to deliver our upwardly for revised financial guidance just as we had the tremendous visibility into 2020 that I discussed. We have similar visibility into 2021, despite being less than two months through the year, actively reducing our exposure to what has been a fairly volatile LNG market. On the development side, it is critical that our Stage 3 expansion at Corpus Christi maintained its clear competitive advantages. In 2021, our business development origination teams will be working closely together to identify opportunities for further efficiency improvements and commercialization opportunities with the goal of ensuring that we are marketing the most cost effective and environmentally responsible LNG capacity addition in America. Commercially, we continue to believe the long-term supply and demand dynamics in the market today are conducive to long-term contracts progressing. So some obvious preliminary COVID-related headwinds persist. Recent volatility in the LNG market and the rapid tightening of the market towards the end of last year and early this year helps reinforce the value to customers of a flexible, visible, long-term supply agreement with Cheniere. In addition, the market has been responsive to our mid-term marketing efforts. We have recently executed a few transactions in the five to approximately 11-year range. In 2020, we'll be focused on continuing to commercialize our volumes both portfolio volumes from the existing platform in Corpus Christi Stage 3 volumes. And Anatol will talk more about the current market and our positioning in his remarks in a minute. Financially, I've spoken at length about the importance of 2021 as our inflection point for free cash flow. As we expect to be meaningfully free cash flow positive for the first time in the company's history this year, and based on the improvements in the short-term market, a little more so than we expected back in November. Our capital allocation strategy remains a top priority. Initially, we intend to prioritize debt pay down that maintain the flexibility to capitalize on growth opportunities and will provide clarity on capital return to our shareholders later this year. And finally, we're prioritizing efforts on the environmental opportunities we introduced on our third quarter call integrating climate into our full service commercial offering. We've made steady progress on developing a number of those opportunities, which I look forward to updating you on in the near future as those opportunities are crystallized. Turn now to Page 7, as you may have seen this morning, Cheniere plans to begin providing our LNG customers with greenhouse gas emissions data associated with each LNG cargo produced at our facilities, utilizing emissions data from the wellhead to the cargo delivery point. Our goal is to improve the quantification of the lifecycle emissions for LNG. Supporting the efforts of Cheniere, our customers and suppliers to quantify and reduce emissions across the value chain. Our product is already helping our customers by meeting their energy requirements and improving air quality by reducing traditional pollutants and particulate matter. The cargo emissions tags will help our customers further by enabling them to better manage their emission profiles and maximize the benefits of buying our LNG. Cheniere's cargo emission tags or CE tags are a significant step forward for this company in our industry as a whole and progress our efforts on each of the environmental opportunities we discussed in November. These tags will provide access to transparent emission data for our cargoes, a crucial step in understanding and managing emissions profiles. Clear transparent data will enable Cheniere in our value chain partners from upstream producers, midstream infrastructure providers, LNG ship owners, and of course, downstream LNG consumers to identify tangible opportunities to drive continuous improvement in environmental performance. Our size, scale, and reach both upstream and downstream of our facilities makes us ideally suited to lead on this front. This represents the first time a major LNG producer has announced the provision of greenhouse gas emissions profiles associated with every cargo of LNG and producers. We are proud to take a leadership position on this important effort, continuing to be at the forefront of the industry as it evolves and benefits all participants in the value chain. Now, I will turn the call over to Anatol who will provide an update on the LNG market. Thank you, Christine. And we're going to have to divide that question up to a few different points. So we'll start with Anatol. You want to talk about mid-term? Christine, I'll just add, as you all know, I'm an operator by heart and I'm extremely proud of the team. I mean, we have eight trains operating today, as we speak, we're over 6.2(b) today that has been none to the two facilities, and our debottlenecking and operator effectiveness, efficiency program is working extremely well. So there's plenty of more from a portfolio supply perspective that we would like to get termed out. Thanks, Christine. As you said, there's a range of reasons why customers choose to exercise the feature of cancellation for portfolio balancing and other constraints as you correctly point out the margins were not the issue at this point. And our team does an exceptional job of managing our shipping requirements. So there are opportunities for us to take advantage of those available volumes. Thanks, Michael. Not immediately the staggering, but they don't start on a very deferred basis. So this year and next to give you some color on that, in terms of economics, we think that our product is one that has a fair amount of extrinsic value as we just discussed with Christine and we look to price that into those mid-term offerings. So their attractive economics to us, but obviously on a mid-term basis and are not structurally the types of transactions that would underpin incremental investment. Corpus mid-scale, we are 100% focused on making sure that that will be the most competitive expansion project in the U.S. and we feel really good about our positioning there. I think there's an opportunity for us to really move the commercialization forward this year. The volatility in the LNG markets has created a sense of urgency with the customers. And I think we'll be in good shape on that project. Anatol, you have anything to add to that. No, I think, Ben, Corpus Stage 3 will be one of the most economic projects ever on for U.S. LNG. And as you know, we'll be able to leverage our existing infrastructure there and but \u2013 that's a significant amount of organic growth. That's 10 million tons. It's like two more trains effectively, Cheniere trains for us. So as you know, we're finished basically with train 8, we're doing some fine tuning and then it'll be handed off to us. Train 9 is way ahead of schedule that's Sabine Pass 6, and we'll be looking for 10 and 11. But as Anatol said, we'll be very disciplined. We have a lot of access and the portfolio that we'd like to get termed out. And \u2013 but we're very hopeful that there's a huge demand worldwide for the product. I would say, Ben, first, when customers buy LNG from Cheniere, they're not only buying flexible, reliable LNG to meet their energy needs, right. They're buying stability in the sanctity, right, as a U.S. regulatory framework in the U.S. rule of law. So I would say here recently that we've seen a increase in our customers wanting access to U.S. LNG and Cheniere LNG more specifically. I don't know, Anatol, how do you... Good morning, Jeremy. Yes. Well, thanks, Jeremy. And I have to tell you, it was extremely trying time. And I'm looking at everybody in the room, not only on this call, but we were without power, water and heat. I personally for a little over three days and I know Zach was close to the week without any of the three. And so it is good to have 70-ish degrees in Houston today and some normalcy. But we \u2013 when it became clear to us that this was going to be a historic weather event and that, there was a real crisis on human needs for heating and power, we wanted to be part of a solution, not part of the problem. So we actually Corpus tripped offline on Sunday night, there was a power, frequency, drop in the area that took Corpus out. And then things got really cold and very, very fast. So we worked closely with the state and local officials with the upstream producers \u2013 with their producers and with the midstream infrastructure providers to make sure that the gas that would have went to Corpus state in Texas and stayed on those pipes and went to human needs and areas like hospitals and homes. So \u2013 but that's the few customers that we were going to lift at Corpus, most of them were willing to move to Sabine Pass. As you know, the Louisiana did not have the issues that Texas was experiencing and came back fairly quickly from the cold event, as far as power and water, et cetera. And we were able to load them at Sabine and cover that demand from the customers. So we've had \u2013 as I said \u2013 we've got eight trains up and running 6.2(b) going to the facilities and we're back at normal operations. There is upside to it. So the first guidance that we gave was based on a lot of low-hanging fruit without additional investments in the infrastructure. And now we'll be evaluating Anya, what \u2013 when investments that, that we would like to make to the existing facilities to possibly get more output out of them. So there'll be more to come on that, but we'll \u2013 it'll be in lockstep with our guidance and our capital allocation discussions. There is a whole lot in that question that you probably didn't realize, but the first one was the CE tags are different than carbon sequestration. So the CE tags are our ability to basically give a carbon footprint per specific cargo to our customer. So every time that a Cheniere cargo either is purchased FOB, so at that flange, or whether it's delivered that there will be a carbon footprint of what the carbon the CO2 equivalent offsets need to be for that carbon to make it carbon neutral, okay. That tag it's not as easy as it sounds right. We today on the 6.2(b) that we bought today, we bought from 68 different counterparties on 15 different pipelines. So that is not an easy exercise, right. Because as you know, every producer, every pipe maybe has a little different footprint, carbon footprint, and we hope over time that we're going to get better and better at these tags. And then our customers will be able to see more transparently how we're calculating it, and what's all encompassed in it and then we can start managing it more appropriately, the different lifecycle elements of the value chain of LNG. So that's the announcement with the carbon tags or the CE tags, or the cargo tags or the CE tags that we announced this morning. We are constantly evaluating other improvements to our overall emission profile. Carbon sequestration is one of them. As you may or may not know, Stage 3 at Corpus Christi is electric driven compression, not gas driven compression. So its emissions profile looks a lot different than our existing trains. If we buy renewables power to back up the power consumption there that that profile looks significantly better. So we are constantly evaluating how we can make ourselves more environmentally friendly to make the product more sustainable. And get to where people are talking about now gas and LNG as what we believe, which is a part of the solution overall. So did I answer the question for you or wasn't? Yes. Yes, there's a \u2013 we got to walk before we can run. There's a lot of misinformation out there. The initial lifecycle analysis that was done in 2014 from the National Energy Technology Laboratory has numbers that are quite a bit higher than what we think our actual carbon emissions or greenhouse gas emissions profile really is. So we want to make sure that, that we get the right information out there as soon as we possibly can. Absolutely. I think a questioning, if we can raise attractive project financing or term loans for Stage 3, yes, that \u2013 to say that we're confident on that is an understatement considering we went through the pandemic and raised over $2.5 billion at pretty attractive rates last year. So that won't hold us back. That goes with having a bank group of 40 plus banks have supported us for almost a decade and obviously all the capital markets activity that we do to keep on bringing them down and manage their exposures. It's really the latter and the CMI just went to work on hedging as the market went up and putting a like physical cargoes to bed, but fixed prices. There are a few cargoes in there from the medium-term deals. But majority, it was really CMI, yes, being quite active, literally starting the day we gave guidance last year. Thank you, Michael. Okay. So first I do view this as a competitive advantage for us. I think there's a lot of misinformation out there of what are the emissions profile for U.S. LNG. And I think as we begin to discuss in international workshops, what are our methodology and we try to make it more transparent. So if we put everybody else on the same level playing field, I think we're going to find out that U.S. LNG can be very competitive and Cheniere's LNG extremely competitive worldwide in helping with some of these countries environmental aspirations. In regards to President Biden, we're \u2013 we have very strong relationships. Cheniere does in China already. And in all of Asia, we have a great office there. We've sold quite a few cargoes here recently on the spot market to China. And we're hopeful that, that the relationship between the two countries continue to improve. And hopefully we'll be back at the table for more long-term contracting and capabilities. You have anything to add Anatol? Thanks, Jason, and thanks, everybody for your interest in Cheniere. Be safe."

            "name": "Zach Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Anatol, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our fourth quarter and full year financial results and key 2020 financial accomplishments, our increased 2021 guidance and our 2021 financial priorities. Turning to Slide 13. For the fourth quarter, we generated a net loss of $194 million, which was impacted by approximately $515 million related to non-cash mark-to-market losses on commodity and FX derivatives, primarily related to the impact of shifting commodity curves on our long-term IPM agreements for the purchase of natural gas and our forward sales of LNG. As LNG net back curves steadily rose over the course of the quarter. As we have discussed on prior calls, our IPM agreements and certain gas supply agreements qualify as derivatives and require mark-to-market accounting. From period to period, we will experience non-cash gains and losses as movements occur in the underlying forward commodity curves. This accounting treatment coupled with the long-term duration and international price basis of our IPM agreements will result in fluctuations in fair market value from period to period. While operationally, we seek to eliminate commodity risk by matching our natural gas purchases and LNG sales on the same pricing index, our long-term LNG SPAs do not currently qualify for mark-to-market accounting, meaning that the fair market value impact of only one side of the transaction is recognized on our financial statements until the delivery of natural gas and sale of LNG occurs. During the fourth quarter, as global LNG markets strengthened cargo cancellations largely abated, resulting in adjusted EBITDA of $1.05 billion for the quarter and distributed cash flow of approximately $330 million. We recognized an income 477 TBtu of physical LNG during the fourth quarter, including 453 TBtu from our projects and 24 TBtu sourced from third parties. 83% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SBA or IPM agreements. While cargo cancellations largely abated during the fourth quarter, we recognized $38 million of revenues related to canceled cargoes that would have been lifted in the first quarter of 2021. In combination with $47 million of revenues recognized in the third quarter for the cargoes that would have been lifted in the fourth quarter, the net impact on our fourth quarter financial results was immaterial. For the full year, we generated a net loss of $85 million, which was also impacted by non-cash mark-to-market losses on commodity and FX derivatives, as well as certain non-operating losses on modification or extinguishment of debt, interest rate derivatives and our equity method investments. For the full year, we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $3.96 billion, just above the midpoint of our original unchanged guidance range and distributed cash flow of approximately $1.35 billion, above the upper end of our guidance range. As Jack mentioned earlier, to produce these results in the middle of a pandemic and one of the worst LNG market downturns in history is a tremendous testament to the resilience and effectiveness of our business model and to the tenacity and dedication of our people. I'd like to thank the entire Cheniere team for their hard work and contributions, which have enabled us to attain these results. For the full year, we recognized an income almost 1,500 TBtu of physical LNG, including almost 1,400 TBtu from our projects and just over 100 TBtu sourced from third-parties. 78% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SBA or IPM agreements. Turn now to Slide 14. As Jack mentioned, today, we are increasing our guidance ranges for full year 2021 consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow by $200 million, increasing our consolidated adjusted EBITDA range to $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion and our distributed cash flow range to $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion. The largest variable to achieving financial results within our guidance ranges remains the completion of Corpus Christi Train 3, which is now in the late stages of commissioning. That project is progressing very well and remains on target for completion before the end of the first quarter, consistent with the timing we projected last quarter, when we issued our original 2021 guidance. The significant tailwind that enables us to increase our guidance today is the improvement of global LNG market pricing. And our team has been actively selling open volumes for the year to forward sales and hedges, reducing market exposure and increasing earnings visibility. We now sold over 95% of our total expected production for this year. And we currently forecast that a $1 change in market margin would only impact EBITDA by approximately $50 million for the full year 2021. Turn now to Slide 15. Before discussing our financial priorities for 2021, I'd like to recap some of our key achievements in 2020. As Jack mentioned, we raised over $8.5 billion in capital across our structure through the year, strengthening our balance sheet and executing on our capital allocation priorities. Among the transactions, I'd particularly like to highlight refinancing the SPL 2021 notes amid COVID related uncertainty in the capital markets in May, issuing an inaugural CEI bond in September and refinancing the CCH Holdco convertible notes and a significant portion of the CEI convertible notes with that, preventing over 40 million shares of equity dilution. The rating agencies continue to recognize our significant progress and Moody's upgraded Corpus to invest in great in August. Now, both of our projects are rated investment grade by all three agencies. And Fitch recently revised SPLs outlook to positive, while reaffirming its existing IG rating. Additionally, we followed through with our debt reduction plan in the second half of 2020, utilizing $200 million of available cash to pay down outstanding borrowings under the CEI term loan. As we look toward 2021, our primary capital allocation priority is to continue with our debt reduction plan and we have committed at least $500 million this year to pay down outstanding debt. Our second capital allocation priority is to manage upcoming debt maturities. Our only debt maturity in 2021 is a remaining approximately $475 million balance of the CEI convertible notes, which we expect to redeem in cash using cash on hand and availability under the CEI term loan. We've also developed a refinancing plan this year to manage the $1 billion of SPL notes, which mature in March 2022. We anticipate managing that maturity with a combination of options, including debt issued at SPL that migrated to CQP and debt pay down with cash flow. We have already started to derisk this maturity by locking in and approximately $150 million private placement of long-term amortizing fixed rate notes at SPL that are committed to fund in late 2021 at a rate of 2.95%, the lowest yield bond ever secured by Cheniere. As always, we will remain opportunistic in assessing other opportunities to economically refinance debt throughout the structure. Our third primary capital allocation priority is to provide updated guidance on our long-term capital allocation plan and we anticipate communicating that to you in the second half of this year. As we discussed on our last call, 2021 is an inflection point for Cheniere and we expect to generate a significant positive free cash flow for the first time in our history. And this will give us added flexibility in capital allocation decisions. We are evaluating our capital return policy with our board, and we will provide you with additional information later this year, regarding our path to investment grade across the complex, debt pay down priorities and resumption of capital return via share repurchases and our timing of an inaugural dividend. We continue to view a dividend at LNG as an eventuality, due to the long-term highly contracted nature of our business model. And we will evaluate timing and magnitude with our board and in consideration of market conditions, our balance sheet, the stock price and other variables, including ensuring sufficient capital to continue pursuing economically and credit accretive investments in our brownfield expansion opportunities. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions. Hey, Jeremy, it's Zach. So yes, I'll give you a little more insight on that. So you won't see those figures from commissioning show up in P&L. So they instead, they offset CapEx for the project. So they're not showing up in EBITDA or DCF. But those were actually the few cargoes that we really left open going into Q1, considering the uncertainty that comes with commissioning train 3. And based on our latest estimates, I'd say it's adding over $100 million or so of cash flow to our balance sheet, just based on where those margins were at the time. And if you think about our free cash flow, where it does show up, we said that was around $1 billion or so last quarter, we're comfortably above $1 billion at this point. Thanks to that and the improvements in overall EBITDA. Yes. So everything I'll say today is pretty consistent with what we've told you and in the previous quarters, but we'll come back in the second half with a more comprehensive plan to date, we've pretty much given you year by year updates. And we see line of sight to finally getting to the nine trains operational in 2022. So when we do come back to you later this year, it'll be based on that over $12 billion now of available cash over the next five years and how we plan to deploy that methodically for that period of time. But whether a capital return is this year or next year, we'll give you that type of \u2013 yes, that type of update at that point, but it's definitely part of the strategy and with having over $1 billion of free cash flow now this year, you can expect that $500 million in debt pay down is the bare minimum, and there's going to be still leftover money for other capital allocation goals. And I'll just add, even on those mid-term deals, they don't change our guidance whatsoever. They're in our range of what we want for our capacity. But the beauty of it is on a downside case it's still there, so bringing up the downside case even more so. The rating agencies do give us credit, not maybe in our range of 2 to 250 for the open capacity, but they give us some credit. But basically it's around $5.5 billion of consolidated EBITDA in a couple of years. And we need to get under 5 times. We have $31 billion of debt. So that's $3 billion to $4 billion of debt paid down is still the right number, but that's as simple as it should be for us. We'll just complete the trains and follow through with capital allocation. Sure. I think it's just consistency that we keep a $300 million range. I mean it's less than 10% of the overall EBITDA, but you can assume that it's around the midpoint of that range. And again, we're literally less than two months into the year and we raised our guidance by $200 million and that's really thanks to the CMI team of locking in more of those cargoes, meaning that we're over 95% contracted. And then obviously our E&C and operations team getting ready to bring Train 3 to operations, but the variables are, we're still in commissioning. We still have 50 TBtu open. And we're going to really have to just see how the year plays out and we can give you more precise guidance in future quarters."

A reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measure can be found in the appendix to the slide presentation. As part of our discussion of Cheniere's results, today's call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP, or CQP. We do not intend to cover CQP's results separately from those of Cheniere Energy, Inc. The call agenda is shown on Slide 3. Jack will begin with operating and financial highlights, Anatol will then provide an update on the LNG market, and Zach will review our financial results and guidance. After the prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO.\nJack Fusco: Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for your continued support to Cheniere. We have a lot to cover this morning. I'd like to start by thanking the Cheniere professionals that make my job look so easy. As you will see from our results and guidance, it has been a challenging and rewarding quarter during an unimaginable year. This year continues to present us with surprising challenges, and we at Cheniere continue to rise to those challenges, maintain our focus, and execute. I'm extremely proud of the results we\u2019re reporting today. You often hear me speak about the resiliency of our people, our assets, and our business model that has certainly been reinforced today as not only have we navigated the continued direct and indirect challenges of COVID-19 and a difficult global LNG market, but also the added challenges of two major hurricanes recently making landfall near Sabine Pass. While Sabine Pass suffered no significant damage from either Hurricane Laura or Hurricane Delta, many of our co-workers, friends, neighbors, and other members of the Cheniere family were impacted with lost or damaged homes. We are proud to have responded to those natural disasters quickly and impactfully in support of our employees with shelter and clothing in the communities where we live and work in Southwest Louisiana with $1 million donation, and a supply drive with the Astros where we delivered two semi-tractor trailers full of goods. We also managed volatility in the LNG market over the quarter. When the third quarter commenced, we're in a period of relatively high cargo cancellations and low facility utilization. By the time we exited the quarter, LNG market conditions had materially strengthened, which allowed us to ramp up production and capture additional margin. Throughout this year\u2019s volatility, our visibility to achieving full year 2020 financial results within the guidance ranges remain virtually unchanged. Additionally, we've received an increasing number of questions from our shareholders regarding the global energy transition in the role of natural gas and LNG in a lower carbon future. Natural gas is an affordable, reliable, cleaner burning global fuel source, and we are confident in natural gas playing an increasingly important role in the global energy mix for many years as countries set carbon neutrality goals for the second half of this century. Cheniere delivers abundant cleaner burning natural gas from North America to the rest of the world. So, it can displace dirtier fuel sources like coal and oil, helping these countries achieve their environmental goals. We remain steadfast on allocating capital to the most attractive risk-adjusted opportunities for continued growth in our core liquefaction platform as we simultaneously seek to optimize our environmental footprint and support our customers and their downstream economies and achieving their long-term energy security and environmental goals. Please turn to Slide 5. This year with cargo cancellations, our quarterly results have been difficult for you all to predict. As a reminder, during the second quarter, our long-term customers utilized optionality in their contracts by canceling cargoes at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi. For cargoes canceled during 2Q, that would have been delivered to our customers in 3Q, the revenue related to those cargoes over $450 million was brought forward and recognized in 2Q since our obligations to deliver those cargoes were extinguished. During the third quarter of 2020, we only generated $477 million of consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow of over $190 million on revenues of approximately $1.5 billion. Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter was $463 million. Despite a challenging 2020, I am pleased to once again confirm our 2020 full-year guidance range of $3.8 billion to $4.1 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion in distributable cash flow. I'm also pleased to report that we are currently tracking to the midpoint of the EBITDA range and the high end of the DCF range as the market has improved, and we continue to execute and optimize. Looking ahead to 2021, we look forward to delivering growth in our financial metrics, driven primarily by the expected completion and commencement of operations of Train 3 at Corpus Christi early next year. I am pleased today to introduce full year 2021 guidance of $3.9 billion to $4.2 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA, and $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in distributable cash flow. Construction progress continues to reinforce our legacy of best-in-class execution. [Indiscernible] progressing Corpus Christi Train 3 and Sabine Pass Train 6 on accelerated schedules well ahead of the guaranteed timelines and within budget. Corpus Christi Train 3 is about 97% complete, and the commissioning process is progressing very well with feed gas introduced into the train in October. We expect first LNG production from Train 3 in the coming weeks. [Indiscernible] now predict substantial completion in the first quarter of 2021. Sabine Pass Train 6 is approximately 71% complete. [Indiscernible] continues to project substantial completion in the second half of 2022, having recently accelerated that timeframe. Once again, during the third quarter, Zach and the finance team were very busy executing on our financial strategy. Year-to-date, we have raised over $8.5 billion from our banks and institutional capital providers in support of our long-term financial strategies and priorities. Zach will cover our third quarter capital raising activity, which was highlighted for the successful issuance of our inaugural bond for Cheniere Energy, later on this call. Now turn to Slide 6, where I\u2019ll discuss our upwardly revised run rate production guidance and its strategic implications. Our efforts to maximize LNG production have yielded continuous improvement in our per train run rate production forecast, which helped drive the range of our run rate financial guidance. At our Analyst Day in 2017, we originally forecast run rate production of 4.3 million to 4.6 million tons per annum per train. Today, we're raising that level once again to 4.9 million to 5.1 million tons per annum as our operational expertise, our maintenance optimization, and our debottlenecking programs continue to produce incremental and reliable production from our existing infrastructure platform. From our initial guidance, these increases have added an aggregate of up to 7 million tons per year of additional marketable LNG or virtually an entire additional train. This incremental volume has strategic implications for Cheniere from a high level. It means we are less contracted on a run rate basis than we were before. And based on our disciplined approach to capital investment decisions, we have incremental volume to sell prior to sanctioning any new infrastructure. Make no mistake, Corpus Christi Stage 3 is shovel-ready and one of the most cost competitive LNG projects worldwide, but we are committed to capital discipline, and we'll only sanction that project when it meets or exceeds our financial capital investment parameters. Our most important metric is the level of contracted commercialization of our production. We've historically targeted a minimum of 80% of our production under contract, but as we continue to improve on our operation and maintenance management are more comfortable with increasing that contracted production target to up to 90%. Therefore, our commercial efforts are squarely focused on this incremental volume today. Meaning the timing of Stage 3 FID will be dependent upon firming up, not just Stage 3 but this virtual additional train worth of production, as well. As we enter into additional commitments across our platform, we will continue to deploy time and resources to ensure that Stage 3 remains as competitive and efficient as possible. This incremental production is already in our portfolio and available for our marketing and origination teams to contract on a short, medium or long-term basis. The fact that this production requires no meaningful additional capital, nor is it dependent on the sanctioning of new infrastructure gives us immense flexibility to tailor the structure of these agreements, to the needs of our customers. Now turn to Slide 7, on several of our recent quarterly calls, I've spent time highlighting our ESG efforts, including our company-wide focus on the challenges and opportunities, these important topics present, our climate and sustainability principles in our enhanced disclosures highlighted by the publication of our inaugural corporate responsibility report earlier this year. I view the growing importance of ESG in general and the emphasis on decarbonation specifically as significant tailwind to our business. As I said earlier, we're confident that natural gas and particularly LNG has a key role to play in the global transition to a lower carbon future, given its place at the intersection of reliably powering economic activity and providing a cleaner energy source worldwide. With that being said, I'd like to take the discussion one step further and give you a sense of how we are synthesizing this information and integrating it into our strategic priorities. At Cheniere, we are in a unique position to bring about change when considering the diverse group of partners across our entire business from upstream suppliers to our wide range of LNG customers and shipping providers. Individually and collectively, our reach and relationships provide us strong framework to enable the integration of climate solutions that will improve Cheniere\u2019s footprint and help ensure our partners across the full value chain realize the full environmental benefits from our LNG. To carry out this integration, we are methodically reviewing our business to quantify our life cycling missions and to identify and analyze climate related opportunities across our value chain, with strategic goals of resiliency, transparency, avoidance, and reduction. I'd like to touch on a couple of these efforts briefly. First, we're analyzing our life cycle greenhouse gas emissions across Cheniere\u2019s value chain and evaluating the areas where we have direct and indirect control. While we have achieved a one-third reduction in Scope 1 greenhouse gas emission intensities from 2016 to 2019. We continue to seek ways to further reduce the environmental footprint of our own operations, including assessing the economic and operational feasibility of CO2 management solutions at Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi. Outside of our facilities, we're looking both upstream and downstream at climate focused opportunities. These efforts involve collaborating with our partners throughout the value chain to identify and pursue actionable solutions. While our efforts are relatively early stage, we're encouraged by the mutual support for these pursuits, from our value chain partners. Along these lines, we're actively pursuing opportunities in each of the following areas, LNG shipping, gas procurement and transportation, renewable power procurement, digitization, operations and supply chain management. In addition, we continue to evaluate offering environmentally beneficial products and services at our facilities that compliment our core business and leverage our infrastructure position such as LNG bunkering services for the marine fuel market. Each of these initiatives has a potential to not only positively impact the environmental profile of Cheniere and our LNG, but also the industry at large, earning returns for our shareholders and solidifying LNG\u2019s and Cheniere\u2019s foothold in supporting growing energy demand worldwide through the century. And now I'll turn the call over to Anatol, who will provide an update on the LNG market.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. We hope that everyone is continuing to stay safe and healthy. Please turn to Slide 9. As usual, we'll start with a few comments about the current global environment, then discuss some of the more specific factors relating to the primary LNG markets. The LNG industry has faced some exceptional circumstances in 2020 and has responded with flexibility and resilience. These factors continued to unfold in the third quarter, reinforcing the message and validating the ability of our industry to respond to market conditions in an orderly systematic manner, thanks in large part to the flexibility of U.S. LNG. As we move through this challenging period in the market and look forward, we continue to be bullish about the way the market is rebalancing the strength of LNG demand recovery and the longer-term prospects for natural gas and LNG as key vectors in the global energy transition. Despite the impact of lockdowns in many markets in the second quarter, the industry has still delivered net positive demand growth totals year-to-date. Unlike most other commodities, LNG demand grew 3% year-to-date through September, adding more than 7 million tons of consumption versus last year. The U.S. was the main beneficiary of that growth as exports increased by 34% or 8.3 million tons to approximately 33 million tons year-to-date. Global LNG supplies were highest this year in the first quarter with production falling over the course of the summer to below year ago levels by Q3. LNG production levels decreased 6% or nearly 6 million tons during the third quarter of this year, as supply was curtailed across both U.S. and non-U.S. sources in response to decreasing spot prices as the market became increasingly concerned about exceeding natural gas storage capacity in Europe. The reduction in LNG supply from curtailments helped avert a storage crunch in late summer and position the market to start responding positively to the rebounding gas and LNG demand, we're now seeing in many countries as we head towards the winter season. Now let's look at those trends in more detail in the European and Asian markets. Turning to Slide 10, the global gas market was under pressure throughout the first half of 2020 as a result of a confluence of factors, two consecutive unseasonably warm winters in key LNG demand centers, the coronavirus impacts of course on economic activity and record high storage levels, which one combined led to historically low gas prices worldwide. Today, however, with our indications that point to stabilizing market conditions in terms of both supply and demand, and we're optimistic for continued recovery both in Europe and Asia. In Europe, lower volumes of Russian pipeline gas was the biggest factor helping the region rebalance during the third quarter as pipeline exports to Europe decreased by over 2 Bcf a day year-on-year. Upstream outages and maintenance elsewhere in Europe also cut indigenous production by 1 Bcf a day. In addition, U.S. LNG cargo cancellations from June onward added support to the market, and total LNG imports into Europe decreased 0.9 Bcf a day or 1.7 million tons year-on-year during the third quarter. Gas demand in Europe recovered to 2019 levels in the third quarter. In addition, for the first time, since January 2019, the Eurozone PMI climbed to expansion levels in July and has remained at expansion level since. Eurozone industrial production continues to gradually rise, providing a positive carryover for gas demand and gas-fired power generation across the major European markets has stayed firm despite the decrease in total generation of about 5% year-on-year in Q3. As a result of these factors, European gas prices have recovered from their lows earlier this year, incentivizing LNG customers to resume lifting cargoes from the U.S. Recovery indicators in Asia are also encouraging. LNG imports into the region increased 8.4% during the third quarter, and we're slightly higher year-on-year. Reduced nuclear generation in Japan and gas demand growth in India, Taiwan and China supported LNG use. Year-to-date, aggregate imports into India, Taiwan and China increased by over 8 million tons year-on-year, offsetting part of the decreases in South Korea and other nations. India briefly overtook South Korea in July and August as the world's third largest LNG importer. Lower spot LNG prices drove imports up 10% or 0.6 million tons year-on-year for the third quarter. Decreasing domestic gas production also supported imports and the recent markdown in regulated domestic gas prices could potentially further suppress indigenous production, which is down 10% year-to-date. LNG imports into Taiwan also increased by 9% or 0.4 million tons year-on-year due to summer cooling load. China's LNG demand increased by 13% or 2 million tons year-on-year in third quarter, while domestic production growth slowed and pipe imports continue to decline during the period. The economic recovery in China continued to accelerate with third quarter GDP expanding by about 5% year-on-year, following a 3.2% increase in Q2. Of note, and despite the stresses of the pandemic, policy priorities in China continue to favor broad based adoption of cleaner-burning fuels to displace coal. For example, China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment proposed to have more than 7 million households in North China switched from dispersed coal heating to cleaner-burning options by the end of October. Assuming half of the targeted households undergo coal to gas switching, it's estimated to generate up to 3.5 million tons of LNG equivalent of demand this winter. Finally, I'd like to turn to some longer-term observations. Please turn to Slide 11. As Jack mentioned, one of the most popular and pertinent topics we've been asked about recently is the global energy transition and the role of LNG engineering that transition. We firmly believe in natural gas and LNG as key sources of energy for decades to come, even at the most accelerated energy transition scenarios. The value of our business model and our infrastructure remains intact and provides a source of significant stable, highly visible long-term cash flows over the next almost two decades. And we see tailwinds for further growth, both within and well past that timeline. The chart on the right of that slide show several recent global LNG forecasts, including our own, highlighting a wide range of potential global LNG demand scenarios out to 2040. The variances between forecasts are largely driven by environmental policy assumptions. Clearly, there's significant expected LNG demand growth in almost all forecasts, including IEA\u2019s sustainable development scenario. Most consultants predict well over 200 million tons of incremental LNG needed in the market by 2040. Even under the sustainable development scenario, the IEA projects that over 100 million tons of incremental LNG will be needed. We remain confident in our forecast, which is more bullish for LNG growth than the IEA scenarios as we continue to see enduring support for natural gas and LNG throughout multiple policy initiatives in countries and regions around the world that appreciate natural gas is a critical component in achieving environmental policy targets on carbon emissions. We have listed some of these initiatives in key gas and LNG markets in the matrix on the left of the slide for reference. China and India, for example, aim to increase the share of gas in our primary energy mix from 8% and 6%, respectively, to 15% by 2030. This can add over 14 Tcf of gas demand in only a decade in those two countries. Global players are following through on these commitments to environmental goals, supporting long-term increased use of natural gas and LNG in the form of major infrastructure projects. Currently, hundreds of billions of dollars are being invested across Europe and Asia in natural gas projects under construction. And if we include planned commitments, the total is well over a trillion. Some examples include India's commitment to invest over 60 billion to drive its gas-based economy, Europe\u2019s commitment of well over 100 billion in gas-fired power, import terminals and pipelines, and China's hundreds of billions of dollars all along the natural gas value chain. We highlight regas capacity, which will not only expand existing import capacities in rapidly growing markets like China and India, but also add nine new import markets, raising the total to over 50 by 2024 from just 15 markets as recently as 2005. The world is facing multiple challenges in the transition to lower carbon future. These challenges vary from region to region, and we recognize that there is no universal solution today. Countries and economies are forced to reconcile economic growth and energy security, energy affordability, and energy intensity challenges while managing their carbon footprint. At Cheniere, we seek to support our customers in helping solve their long-term energy challenges with flexible solutions and providing them the opportunity to improve quality of life and to balance their economies and environmental targets. As a cleaner-burning fuel with far lower emissions than coal or liquid fuels in power generation, natural gas and LNG will play a positive role in ensuring reliable energy supply, balancing power grids, and contributing to a lower carbon energy system globally. And now, I'll hand the call over to Zach to review our financial results.\nZach Davis: Thanks, Anatol, and good morning, everyone. Also hope everyone is doing well. I'm pleased to be here today to review our third quarter financial results, discuss our 2021 increased run rate guidance, and provide an update on our capital markets initiatives and capital allocation priorities. Turning to Slide 13. For the third quarter, we generated a net loss of $463 million, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $477 million and distributable cash flow of over $190 million. As Jack mentioned, our third quarter results were significantly impacted by the accelerated recognition of revenues in the second quarter, related to canceled cargoes that were scheduled to be delivered in the third quarter. As the global LNG market has begun to return to balance, the number of cancellations for fourth quarter cargoes has declined, meaning that the revenue acceleration that occur in the second quarter did not recur in the third quarter with fourth quarter results positioned to normalize. For the nine months ended September 30, we reported net income of $109 million, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.9 billion and distributable cash flow of over $1 billion. Through September 30, we exported 920 TBtu of LNG from our liquefaction projects, including the 193 TBtu of LNG or 55 cargos during the third quarter. Total volumes produced and exported in the third quarter were 30%, more than 80 TBtu, lower than exports in the second quarter of this year, as cargo cancellations continued into and peaked during the shoulder season in the third quarter. For the third quarter, we recognized an income 168 TBtu of LNG produced at our liquefaction projects and 31 TBtu of LNG sourced from third-parties. Approximately 74% of the LNG volumes recognized in income during the third quarter was sold under either long-term SBAs or IPM agreements, a proportion materially consistent with the second quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, we recognized an income 932 TBtu of LNG produced at our liquefaction projects and 79 TBtu of LNG sourced from third-parties. Approximately 77% of the year-to-date LNG volumes recognized an income was sold under either long-term SBAs or IPM agreements. As a reminder, during the second and third quarters, our results were materially impacted by the timing of revenue recognition related to cargo cancellations. In the second quarter, we recognized $458 million of revenues related to canceled cargoes that would have been delivered during the third quarter. During the third quarter, we recognized $47 million of revenues related to canceled cargoes that would have been delivered during fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of out-of-period cargo cancellations, our third quarter revenues of $1.46 billion would have been approximately $1.87 billion. The impact on consolidated adjusted EBITDA is similar to the impact on revenue. Income from operations for the third quarter was $72 million, a decrease of over $850 million compared to the second quarter, driven primarily by the accelerated recognition of revenues in the second quarter for canceled cargoes that would have been delivered in the third quarter; partially offset by decreased costs incurred in response to COVID-19 pandemic during the third quarter. Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter was $463 million or negative $1.84 per share, an increase of $650 million from the second quarter of 2020. This increased net loss was driven primarily by the decrease in income from operations, increased loss on modification or extinguishment of debt, primarily related to redeeming the remaining CCH Holdco II notes and a portion of our 2021 convertible notes, and increased loss in our equity method investments, partially offset by decreased income attributable to non-controlling interest, increased tax benefit, decreased interest expense, and decreased interest rate derivative loss. Before turning to guidance and capital allocation priorities, I'd like to briefly touch on key financing transactions during the third quarter. As we've discussed in our prior call, we redeemed the remaining outstanding CCH Holdco II convertible notes and a significant portion of our 2021 convertible notes in July using the Cheniere term loan, in a transaction which both address near-term and relatively high-cost maturities and prevented significant share dilution, reducing our run rate share count by over 40 million shares. In August, Corpus Christi Holdings or CCH received its third and final investment-grade rating, when Moody's upgraded CCH\u2019s senior debt to a rating of Baa3. The upgrade from Moody's is one of the few, if not the only upgrade from high yield to investment grade in all of energy in 2020. And further reinforces the credit quality of our project level economics that are the foundation of this company. Following the upgrade, CCH opportunistically issued $769 million, a 3.52% senior secured notes due 2039 in a private placement transaction, securing the lowest yielding bond ever across the Cheniere complex. The proceeds from the issuance were used to prepay a portion of the CCH credit facility. In September, we refinanced a portion of the outstanding Cheniere Term Loan balance via issuance of an inaugural bond at CEI, which Jack highlighted a few minutes ago. This successful issuance was outsized to $2 billion and priced at 4.58% coupon reflecting the strength with which the debt capital markets use our business model and operational capability. Strategically, this was a very important transaction for us as it established CEI as a corporate issuer with a path to future unsecured issuances, a critical step in our long-term capital strategy. We remain committed to debt migration from our operating companies to our parent level companies to improve project level resiliency, reduce structural subordination at CEI and be secured the balance sheet over time, while also targeting investment grade ratings across the Cheniere complex. Also during the quarter, infrastructure funds managed by Blackstone and Brookfield purchased an over 40% stake in CQP from Blackstone Energy Partners, which had owned since 2012. Infrastructure funds at Blackstone and Brookfield are among the largest global long-term infrastructure investors and the investment made in CQP is a testament to the quality of our contracted LNG asset platform and to the long-term role of Cheniere and LNG in meeting growing energy demand worldwide. Turn now to Slide 14, driven by continued excellence in operations and execution and despite a myriad of challenges this year. We are again reconfirming our 2020 full year guidance of consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $3.8 billion to $4.1 billion and distributed cash flow of $1 billion to $1.3 billion. As we look forward to the remainder of 2020, we\u2019ve hedged virtually all of our remaining expected production volumes and do not expect meaningful variability as a result of any moves in market pricing. Today, we are issuing 2021 consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance of $3.9 billion to $4.2 billion, distributable cash flow guidance of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion and CQP distribution guidance of $2.60 to $2.70 per unit. The largest variable in our projected financial results for 2021 is the timing of completion of Corpus Christi Train 3, and our guidance assumes a late first quarter completion of that train. While we have pre-sold approximately 90% of our total expected production capacity for next year, consistent with previous years, we currently forecast that a $1 change in market margin would impact EBITDA by approximately $200 million for full year 2021, with the variability disproportionately weighted to the upside and downside limited to approximately half of that amount given sub $1 margins on average across the calendar year in the market today. Today, we are also pleased to revise upward our run rate financial guidance driven by increased run rate production guidance as Jack described. Increasing the operating capacity of our existing infrastructure drives increased EBITDA and cash flow and increases our return on investment. As we have increased production guidance by over half an mtpa per train is essentially received an extra trains worth of production in our nine train platform. Today, we are raising our nine train run rate consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance to $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion and distributable cash flow guidance to $2.6 billion to $3 billion. Our run rate financial guidance ranges assume production of 4.9 to 5.1 mtpa per train and marketing margins of $2 to $2.50 per MMBtu. We are also increasing our run rate distributable cash flow per share guidance to $10.25 to $11.75 per share, an increase of $2 or over 20% at the midpoint from our prior DCF per share guidance, driven both by increased run rate DCF expectations and a decrease in run rate shares outstanding by over $40 million as a result of the settlement of the CCH Holdco II and the 2021 Cheniere convertible notes in cash as opposed to equity. Please turn now to Slide 15. In addition to expected growth in both consolidated to adjusted EBITDA distributable cash flow next year, we also forecast 2021 to be an inflection point for free cash flow. And we expect to generate significant positive free cash flow for the first time in Cheniere\u2019s history. As we continue the commissioning process in near completion of Corpus Christi Train 3, we expect a dramatic reduction in capital commitments and an increase in operational cash flow in 2021, leaving a significant amount of free cash flow, which will give us added flexibility on capital allocation. One of our primary long-term balance sheet priorities is achieving investment grade ratings at the Cheniere level by the early to mid-2020s, in order to solidify our long-term balance sheet provide stability to our run rate cash flow per share guidance. Due to the incremental debt we took on to address the convertible notes in the third quarter, our capital allocation priority over the short and medium-term will be debt pay down. Executing on that priority, we prepaid $100 million of the Cheniere Term Loan in the third quarter. And we expect to do the same during the fourth quarter. And we expect to pay down at least another $0.5 billion of debt during 2021, while still having additional free cash flow. As we forecast our cash flow generation profile and debt reduction plans through 2021. To fortify our current CEI ratings and remain on track for investment grade metrics in the coming years, we expect to be in a position in the second half of the year once Corpus Christi Train 3 is ramped up to resume capital returns via our existing buyback program by potentially initiating a dividend or both. We view a dividend at LNG as an eventuality as the long-term, highly contracted nature of our business model is ideally suited for it over time. We will evaluate timing and magnitude with our Board and in consideration of market conditions, our balance sheet and the stock price. We currently forecast the significant amount of available cash over the next five years, approximately $12 billion. And this amount is expected to provide us flexibility to reduce their consolidated debt and achieve investment grade ratings at the Cheniere level to return capital to shareholders via buybacks and/or dividends, and be in a position to invest in cash flow and credit accretive growth projects, such as Corpus Christi Stage 3 that meet our contractual and investment return parameters. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] All right. Our first question will come from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nJack Fusco: Hi Jeremy, how are you?\nJeremy Tonet: Good, good. Thank you. Just want to touch base, it seems like there\u2019s some news out there with Cheniere possibly having new business with China, some agreements reached there. Just wondering if you could confirm if that\u2019s the case and just is this indicative of the broader market kind of coming together a bit better for signing some types of term contracts at this point or any color you could provide there would be helpful.\nJack Fusco: Jeremy, I\u2019ll start, and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Anatol. First, thanks for the question. Look, we \u2013 I firmly believe Cheniere has the best Chinese origination office in Beijing of any of the LNG providers. I\u2019m very pleased with my team. We \u2013 as you know, we were one and only to sign a long-term \u2013 the only to sign a long-term agreement with China early on in 2018, and our relationship there just continues to grow stronger and stronger. We\u2019ve sent a significant amount of spot cargoes to China here recently. I\u2019ll let Anatol address the\u2026\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Jack. Hi, Jeremy. Yes, as Jack said, it\u2019s a market that we have been focused on almost as soon as we became an operating company with our Beijing office opening up in 2017. The team there has done a great job. It\u2019s a sign of China\u2019s progress, right, this GDP growth, gas demand growth over a Bcf a day of growth in total Chinese gas demand, and almost a Bcf of that came from LNG. Markets are opening up. China is very committed to meeting its 15% objective, type [ph] China was launched at the end of Q3. It is a mechanism to allow other companies to access the market, third-party access to LNG terminals and pipelines, and there\u2019s a tremendous amount of gas demand growth. And we are very well-positioned to serve that. So very proud to be in a position to work with foreign energy, one of the fastest growing and up and coming second tier players, and we\u2019ll endeavor to find multiple solutions to enable them to meet their downstream objectives of growing gas, maintaining their clean footprint, and finding creative solutions for their customers. So, I\u2019m very proud of the team and hopefully a sign of things to come.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it, sounds really exciting there, and just wanted to pivot towards kind of some of Jak\u2019s comments with regards to capital allocation, and it seems like based on your guidance, DCF could be up to $1.5 billion at the high end there, you talked about paying down $0.5 billion of debt, at least $1 billion of cash flow next year that you\u2019re able to do a lot with, it seems like you could start kind of [indiscernible] dividends at that point in or at least in 2022 seems maybe somewhat earlier than I guess what was previously described. Just wondering if you could talk us through why not start the dividend at the back half next year. It seems like that could draw in a whole bunch of new investors having that income stream.\nJack Fusco: A few things there, but thanks, Jeremy. First off, we\u2019re in ongoing discussions every quarter with the Board about capital allocation, whether it be debt paydown, share buybacks, or eventually a dividend, but when you look at what the share price is right now, and we\u2019re talking about $11 DCF per share in a couple of years, the decision is still pretty easy that it\u2019s going to be share buybacks. But in terms of your numbers, you\u2019re right. We have around $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion of DCF next year, but keep in mind, we\u2019ll still have a couple hundred million left at Corpus, and we have other \u2013 a few other debottlenecking and development costs that we\u2019ll be spending on. So, it\u2019s not all free cash flow. You have to strip that out first. But for the year, yes, we have around $1 billion of free cash flow next year for a company that really was just negative for 20 years previously.\nJeremy Tonet: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: All right. [Operator Instructions] Having said that we\u2019ll move on to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Lapides: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. It\u2019s actually a little bit of an operational one. Just curious this is what the third or fourth time you\u2019ve raised, you\u2019re portraying guidance in terms of production capacity. Is there something that your team or Bechtel\u2019s team is doing that\u2019s enabling you to do this while we\u2019re not seeing many of the other global LNG liquefaction owners announce similar increases? And do see potential for others to do that in the industry when you look around, in other words, could that add a lot more liquefaction supply to the industry without having \u2013 without others having to build more trains? Just trying to think through the dynamics for you guys specifically, but also the broader market.\nJack Fusco: Thank you, Michael. So, I\u2019m going to address that directly. So first off, look, we have the best team of Cheniere professionals that, that exist. It is a \u2013 it\u2019s a team that is very experienced from around the world not only with ConocoPhillips optimization, designs, but also ATI and a whole host of other things, and we have the benefit of having the full value chain, meaning the gas procurement side and our ability to deliver gas at varying pressures and heat content, which really influenced the performance of the trains. The team has done a fantastic job with what we call it debottlenecking, but also maintenance optimization and trying to extend the periods between defrost, extend our turbine, overhauls with Baker Hughes, and as well as hitting all the bottlenecks throughout the train. So, I feel very good that we continue to pluck what I call the low-hanging fruit. I think there\u2019s more room for us to go. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re done yet, and what it gives us a ton of flexibility with our customers to design solutions for them without having to have CPC on additional infrastructure. I don\u2019t want to comment on any of the other LNG facilities, because they\u2019re all a little bit different from a technological perspective, but we feel very good about where we\u2019re able to achieve.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, Jack. Much appreciate it.\nOperator: All right. Moving on, next question will come from Christine Cho with Barclays.\nChristine Cho: Good morning. Thanks for all the color today. I wanted to start off Jack with the comments that you made in the prepared remarks, about how you plan to increase from 80% to 90% of your capacity to contract, as you\u2019ve increased the production capacity for train and you have a track record. Obviously the spending to expand that capacity is very capital efficient. So how should we think about the tolling fee that you would want to charge? I would think it doesn\u2019t have to be as high as what you would have charged in a Corpus Phase 3. But is that a fair way to think about it?\nJack Fusco: Yes. Hi Christine, thank you. And first let me address the first part going from 80% to 90%, that\u2019s still the \u2013 my comfort with raising our contracted amount, if you will, is with my comfort in my operating and maintenance staff at the facilities. Again, their performance has been fantastic this year. We've been thrown everything. Everything has been thrown at us and we've continued to perform and outperform, I think what everyone's expectations were. So as we get more and more comfortable with our stability of operations and our reliability, it allows us to fill more comfortable with terming out our production. So as far as the cost, there's \u2013 or the price of the fixed fee, there's a lot of different variables we can draw upon with that. And we can go out longer in term or shorter in term or if the quantity is bigger and longer than we may give them a little more of a discount for lack of a better word, but we have a lot of flexibility in what we're able to offer. And as we turn things up, you should expect those to flow into our guidance and be reflected in our numbers. Anatol, do you have anything to add on that?\nAnatol Feygin: No, Jack. Just the flexibility that you hit on allows us to transition from what underpins the seven Trains, which was a very fixed construct of 20 year deals to, as you know, Christine, a lot of flexibility and a lot of creativity as we ensure that we generate the returns that we need, while finding a way to support our customers and creatively adjust to market conditions.\nChristine Cho: Thanks for that. And then, I guess, just to follow on to that line of thinking, the run rate guidance has been the marking margins of 2 to 2.50. Just wanted to get a sense of how confident you are in these margins over the long-term. And is it primarily because you have a large portion of this already locked up at DMI or is it also the fact that over time \u2013 over the long-term, some of this capacity \u2013 excess capacity will be contracted up and will likely be at least 2 to 2.50, which gives you the confidence to put that range up today?\nJack Fusco: The short answer is, yes. Thanks, Christine. We see the, again, a growing market for LNG and we think that it is supplied in large part by U.S. projects, our project. They are cost competitive in that 2 to 2.50 range on a delivered basis. That's how we evaluate both ourselves and our global competition. And we think that as we move through this period of oversupply with four years of record volumes coming into the market, record growth for the LNG market that ensued, the period of Q2 and Q3 that we just went through the rate at which the market rebounded is fairly astonishing and absorbed and continued to invest in this future project that will drive medium to long-term growth, which we'll need to dispatch these $2 plus margin projects. So we were looking through the cycle between what we have in the books today, of course, as well as where we see the market playing out over the coming years and decades. We're very comfortable with this 2 to 2.50 range.\nAnatol Feygin: I would just add Christine that it's not just the reality of the market, but it really just highlights how durable our EBITDA is. And then it's also just confirmation that we see the ability to hit all of the investment parameters for a project like Stage 3 in this range, signifying how cost competitive Stage 3 really is.\nChristine Cho: Got it. Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Michael Webber with Webber Research.\nWebber Research: Hey, good morning guys. How are you?\nJack Fusco: Good, Michael. How are you?\nWebber Research: Good. Wanted to start off with some the news that got announced today and maybe Anatol, you can have a just as getting a bit more specific around [indiscernible] in terms of that second or third tier of Chinese buyer, right, this is a company that I think they bought their first cargo back in May ever. And then I\u2019ve got a small deal with BP. Having their associate with CNO, in terms of \u2013 just curious in terms of their emerges in the market. Is that a symptom of the reforms we saw last year around the Chinese natural gas pipeline network? And I'm just trying to think of it to what degree do you view this as a one-off versus that second or third tier of Chinese buyer kind of finally finding the support necessary to be more aggressive in the market? It's a really interesting counterparty to show up taking that much volume that quickly.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Michael. Yes. So ever since we started to engage in China in 2016, and then of course, expanded our presence with the Beijing office in 2017. We've been engaged in various discussions, including policy discussions to help China, drive this natural gas penetration in the market, contributed a chapter here and there to the pipe China discussions. And we think that this is a very important step that the policy makers have taken to of course, take a very large amount of infrastructure into a vehicle that is intended to provide third-party access, transparency, drive access to gas, all over the country. And foreign has division to be one of the early movers along that dimension and take advantage of this TPA, as you mentioned with some other contracts that, that BP deal, which proceeded RHOA but it's continuing to grow very aggressively. It isn't a great market in the South China for us to access and to continue to support. We do not see it as a one-off, we think that this is a cadre of companies that we've engaged with for years and looking towards continued success and continued traction there.\nJack Fusco: And Michael, I have to say that, one of the issues structurally in China is that the Citygate natural gas prices didn't fluctuate with actual gas prices. So when the spot prices dropped, China's demand didn't increase because the Citygate price was kept artificially high. Now you're going to see some of that flow through with some of these other players and pipe China, to where they can access lower \u2013 potentially lower prices and you'll see the demand response increase also. So we're extremely supportive of the reforms.\nWebber Research: Yeah, that's a really exciting data point. And just as a follow-up maybe kind of vaguely along those lines and maybe different demand sync, earlier this quarter, there's a bunch of relatively fuzzy news flow around a French counterparty, potentially backing away from the only U.S. supposedly related to sourcing gas and especially frat gas. I'm just curious to what the greed is that come up with your customer base, and specifically as you guys work to commercialize for this phase three. Is that a one off or is that something you think you will be contending with to access the European markets for years to come?\nJack Fusco: Well, I'll take it a couple of different ways. As you know, a lot of our foundation customers are European. We have two very large French companies that are long-term foundation customers, both total and electricity to fonts and the focus on decarbonisation is here. It's here to stay. It hasn't come up with us yet, but we are anticipating it. We're moving forward with quantifying what we can do to make our product much more desirable in the event that need to as you know, from my talking points from manifests talking points, our initial focus is on identifying and pursuing actionable scientific near-term solutions that we can lower our carbon footprint. We do think the whole energy transition discussion is going to be a very long road and take a whole lot of everything to make work. But go ahead, Anatol.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Jack. Just to follow on Jack's comments, as you know, we view Europe as a very attractive and important market for the coming decade and beyond. Europe is investing tremendously in natural gas infrastructure projects in regas pipelines, reversing pipelines, power plants, et cetera, that are all driving natural gas demand. We continue to engage with companies with continue to engage in Brussels, as Jack said, one of our deliverables to that discussion, our transparent metrics are actual numbers that will form the discussion and continue to inform the discussion as opposed to some of the allegations that you've seen out there in the press. And we're delivering those concrete metrics and concrete improvements to that continued engagement with Brussels. There's no universal solution, as we said, we're not going to be everything to all people, but we are confident that we are a key part of the energy transition and part of this solution going forward. And you see examples of that engagement, those infrastructure additions, greater gas and LNG penetration into Europe to meet its strategic objectives of environmental benefits and security of supply.\nWebber Research: Got you. Okay. Thanks for the time, guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And moving on from UBS, the next question will come from Shneur Gershuni.\nShneur Gershuni: Hi, good morning, everyone, or afternoon, I guess at this point. I was wondering if we can go back to the discussion you had with Christine and some of the prepared marks that you had. If I understand sort of the discussion correctly, there's been a lack of FIDs of new capacity in 2019 and 2020. We're headed towards a tightening of capacity and rather a deficit in the market, in a year or two out. Is the concept nail that you want to lock up some of your CMI capacity on longer term arrangements five, seven, eight years type of thing. And that's kind of where, and move the target from 85% to 90%. And sort of create a more readable earnings base from where you're at. I just kind of want to understand strategically how you're thinking about it and how you\u2019re approaching it.\nJack Fusco: Sure. So again, we're transitioning from a period in our corporate evolution where everything needed to meet the objective of supporting essentially project financing. And as we've talked about, we have this additional capacity. We have the success of the operations team. We've proved the construct of this integrated value chain. And now have the flexibility of altering these commercial solutions and coming up with products that serve our customer's needs. And those products include a midterm product, as well as the shorter term solutions that we've always had and the long-term. We think this market is a market it'll continue to evolve, it will continue to be cyclical. And all of those components short, medium and long-term will be part of the conversation in the LNG market for decades to come. So we're very happy to be in a position to offer that. And as you said, yes, secure margin and have that stability of cash flow, which we know is important to all of our investors.\nZach Davis: I was just going to say, putting in perspective, we're 38, 39 mtpa contracted and we originally thought this would be a 40 million ton portfolio and we've got 45 million tons. So we have some work to do to just contract that up, give everybody even more, certainty on those cash flows gives us a better sense of capital allocation at the same time. But then when it comes to Stage 3 and projects like that, yeah, we're going to be looking for the same creditworthy long-term contracts to justify another multi-billion dollar build-out.\nShneur Gershuni: I think that makes sense a midterm product that gets you over 90% would definitely make a lot of sense. Maybe pivoting a little bit to the government and do appreciate a lot of the color that was presented in the prepared remarks. Can you walk us through what takes you to the high-end of your guidance and conversely, what would take you to the low end of the guidance? Is it \u2013 we have COVID all over again and that's the low end and then everything else is about optionality. It's just wondering if you can talk about some of the inputs that get us to the top end versus low end.\nJack Fusco: Are you mean they made run rate or 2021?\nShneur Gershuni: 2021. 2021.\nJack Fusco: To make it simple, it's really on that open capacity that we were speaking to, but I'd like to give you just a better sense of the year ahead. So for 2021, we'll have eight Trains for the first time. And we're going to have record production of high-30s in terms of mtpa for the year. So last year, when we went into 2020, we had about 2 million tons open, which translated into around a 100 TBtu, in which is why we said a move of $1 was about a $100 million to EBITDA. But this year, we're adding that eighth Train and saying our long-term contracts and selling forward leaves us with around 200 TBtu or just less than 4 million tons currently open, which gets us to that 90% total contract for 2021. So that we were closer to 95% last year to 90% this year going into 2021, and just keep in mind that we've got a train coming online early next year. But I\u2019d say we're actually pretty similar, if not in a better spot than last year, considering that asymmetric upside. So margins currently are in the sub $1 range, meaning downside in EBITDA is really capped at around $100 million, which makes it more insulated than last year. But we still have that upside for every dollar is $200 million. So we're in a pretty good spot and you can imagine we just did budget for the year and when we come up with a range, it's around budget in the midpoint.\nShneur Gershuni: Perfect. Got it. Really appreciate the color today and have a great weekend.\nJack Fusco: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: Great. good morning, everyone. Just had a one quick question. We're starting to see a second wave in COVID lockdowns and at Europe and possibly spread wider. Just want to get your thoughts on \u2013 do you see that \u2013 how you see that impacting LNG demand and basically, are we in for a bit of a rollercoaster here? Thanks.\nJack Fusco: Hey, Michael, this is Jack, I\u2019ll start here also. I mean, this is \u2013 it's been an incredible year. We have put a lot of precautions into our besides and our plans around COVID with biometrics screening, with isolating the workforce, et cetera. And I know that the numbers at least here around Houston and Louisiana and Texas have increased, but we haven't seen any of the increase in cases ourselves with our workforce, which is it's little bit interesting, but we are definitely on guard, as far as our customers so far, as Anatol pointed out, the recovery, especially in Asia has been more v-shaped, it continues to be stronger every day, but Anatol, maybe you want to give more color on Europe or\u2026\nAnatol Feygin: With Asia, yes. So Asia is clearly recovering and Europe is learning how to navigate this issue. Natural gas as you know has been very resilient, even though overall power in the 28 main European markets is down about 5%, natural gas is stable, taking market share away from solid fuels, and this is a very flexible product. And one of the things that we are advantaged in is the ability to respond to these different market moves, whether that is an increase in demand in Asia and a moderation and demand in Europe. That said Europe is in an increasingly better position, we're not facing the issue of storage containment for two reasons. One is, we're finally at levels that have been worked off and are below year ago levels in terms of inventory. And two, obviously going into the winter is a different dynamic than going into the shoulder season of Q2 when we saw that maximum stress and look, we're now nine months into figuring out how to navigate this thing all over the world, and that's improving the outlook as well. So not taking our eye off the ball by any means, but we're endowed with a flexible responsive system that we and our customers know much better how to navigate.\nMichael Blum: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question will come from Alex Kania who is with Wolfe Research.\nAlex Kania: Thanks. I just had a couple, I guess, follow-up first is just on your thoughts on contracting. Is there any sense or greater demand for trying to have the contracts that are shaped more seasonally? And I'm wondering if that's something that you consider more seriously, how that would maybe line up with the kind of increased commitment on the report target for contracting overall in the portfolio. And the second one is just on kind of the run rate, production outlook. I mean, I did see a press release, I guess, from ConocoPhillips earlier this week about additional initiatives that really debottlenecked by the optimized cascade process. So just wondering if those kind of discussions were kind of incorporated in your outlook or is that \u2013 are those things represent maybe more incremental debottlenecking as well?\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks Alex, this is Anatol. I'll start, then I'll hand it over to Jack on the second part. But we are \u2013 clearly the market globally has a forward structure that, says, winter is marginally more valuable than summer. Our efforts \u2013 our commercial efforts have grown leaps and bounds in terms of sophistication and you can look up the original SPAs and see that they make a fairly big deal, most of them make a fairly big deal about being ratable. We could now price things, and affect that solution much more flexibly and easily. And that is a discussion that we have from time-to-time with our customers. So we have no issues with that, and then on top of that, as you know, we have some seasonality in terms of our production capacity, when it's nice and cool in Louisiana, the ops guys have an easier time making more of it. So we evaluate all of these options and normalize them and factor that into our decision of how to move forward.\nJack Fusco: And, in regards to the Conoco, they've been a good partner with us, Ryan Lance is a good friend and they've supported us in our debottlenecking and optimization efforts, throughout this whole process. I think their announcement was on future COP trains, but having said that, every time we do better, the licensing fee goes up, so they're helping us as much as they possibly can.\nAlex Kania: Thanks very much.\nOperator: And moving on, we have Sean Morgan with Evercore.\nSean Morgan: Hey guys. So a question just on the SPAs that are rolling off, I think there's pretty material SPAs that are sort of legacy and from older markets and older plants than Cheniere\u2019s even boldest trains, and so a lot of bonds rolling off through 2025. And I'm wondering, how Cheniere sort of position to compete with these new volumes coming on? And do you see there being a lot more tendering in the market, or do you think that like existing SPAs with long-term tenants are going to be replaced by similar existing SPAs with long-term timer tenors?\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Sean. Yes, so the markets continued to grow dramatically over the past decades, conveniently doubled every decade. And historically when this was a very bespoke sort of point-to-point market, the contractual solutions were fairly standard at that 20 year mark. And as you said, there was a very large amount of volume that reprices, if you will, over the coming years and decades. And that is one of the sources of opportunity for us to take advantage of that. The solutions that the customers will want will vary, there will be a portfolio approach we believe and lots of customers will want the flexible transparent pricing, stable pricing that our long-term contracts offer, others will choose to recontract mid-term, and that's something that we can help with as well as load following if you will, that we can provide at the margin. So, it is another very large opportunity as that volume reprices out of the legacy projects out of North Africa, Qatar, et cetera.\nJack Fusco: And I would say that the customers are demanding more energy diversity, so they don't want to buy from one supplier necessarily. They want to buy from multiple suppliers and ensure a reliable product. They're also looking at diversity from a \u2013 how much do they want oil index versus Henry hub index. And so, I think we'll get our fair share of some of those contracts. And we just continue to try to work on our operational excellence and make sure that they consider us to be an affordable, reliable supplier of LNG.\nSean Morgan: Okay. Thanks. And then we touched briefly on ESG, but I had a question sort of, as it relates to the cost of implementing. We went through the slide and there is a lot of, kind of, I guess, sort of cursory ideas of ways to make it lower carbon, more ESG friendly. And I think Mike touched on that the Europe has \u2013 the European governments are getting kind of more activist in sort of choosing contracts. But how do you look at it sort of balancing your European customers might be a little bit more environmentally sensitive to other customers that are going to be a lot more economically sensitive like India or China.\nJack Fusco: Yes, and that's exactly what we're doing right now is when we say we're \u2013 our initial focus is on identifying and pursuing we're stacking them up. So we know directly and indirectly what the carbon footprint looks like for a cargo of LNG at least from a calculated basis, not an actual basis, which is one of the solutions we'd like to get resolved. But we are quickly identifying, prioritizing and stacking them up on which ones we make economic sense and which we're going to have to put on the back burner for a while until the market wants to pay us for those types of solutions.\nSean Morgan: Okay. Thanks Jack. Thanks, Anatol.\nOperator: All right folks. Moving on our final question is going to come from Ben Nolan with Stifel.\nBen Nolan: All right, I made it. So I got a couple, the first, congrats on the run rate, I think that's fantastic and certainly it's a good track record here. I was thinking maybe or if you could expand on this, and you were clear on sort of debt repayment from a capital allocation perspective. But obviously, it seems like higher run rate is probably most impactful for CQP and potential for them to \u2013 or that vehicle to really ramp up its distributions even more than probably it could have otherwise done. Can you maybe talk through where that might be in terms of a priority going forward?\nJack Fusco: Sure. So we\u2019ve really slowly and steadily increased the CQP distribution over the last few years because we're still in construction. So you'll see us \u2013 we just have increased it by $0.02 annualized, and we'll continue to do that until we finished Train 6. So you could see what range we gave for this coming year and it's about the same type of step up as it was this previous year. And that's really related to just holding back the cash to make sure we can fund the remaining, let's say $900 million or so of unlevered CapEx for Train 6. But clearly on the run rate, it did go up. But if you look at the numbers, it didn't go up all that much, but it is almost at $4 at this point. And the reason for that is because we have an IDR structure. So at this point, since we're in the high split, 50% of every incremental dollar actually goes to CEI. So eventually in terms of distributed cash flow, when we get to $3 billion at CEI, a little over half of that is actually distributions going to us from not just the LP units, but from those IDRs.\nBen Nolan: Right. And I appreciate that, although again, that's probably \u2013 and it's structurally an incentive to actually increase the distribution. The \u2013 switching gears to my follow-on a little bit today or just yesterday, EOG made a huge discovery out in South West Texas. Obviously you guys have already done some of the IPM stuff with them. There is been a lot of slowing down there, and I can imagine that maybe those discussions are not as robust as they used to be, but that's a really big discovery. Could you maybe talk through, \u2013 we talk a lot about the Chinese or Europeans or others looking to buy. Could you maybe talk about sort of where maybe producers are and whether or not you think that, there could be a return to some of those pushed volumes?\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Ben. Yes, this is Anatol. We've always said that we're optimistic on the IPM business and see a number of opportunities there, but it is not a huge sample sets. EOG is a wonderful partner, obviously that IPM transaction started this year, it's been a challenging year for all producers. And as you can imagine, discussions while ongoing are not top of mind, like they were a year or year and a half ago. But we firmly see that the growth of North American production needs to be exported. And we provide the single largest access points to those markets. So we're optimistic that engagement will become more robust as we move forward. And certainly EOG\u2019s contribution will be front and center as well as a handful of other large credit worthy counterparties that have positions that are proximal to our facilities.\nBen Nolan: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks guys.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Ben.\nJack Fusco: And thank you everybody, thanks for your support of Cheniere.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session and our call for today. We do appreciate you joining us. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Anatol Feygin",
            "content": "Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. We hope that everyone is continuing to stay safe and healthy. Please turn to Slide 9. As usual, we'll start with a few comments about the current global environment, then discuss some of the more specific factors relating to the primary LNG markets. The LNG industry has faced some exceptional circumstances in 2020 and has responded with flexibility and resilience. These factors continued to unfold in the third quarter, reinforcing the message and validating the ability of our industry to respond to market conditions in an orderly systematic manner, thanks in large part to the flexibility of U.S. LNG. As we move through this challenging period in the market and look forward, we continue to be bullish about the way the market is rebalancing the strength of LNG demand recovery and the longer-term prospects for natural gas and LNG as key vectors in the global energy transition. Despite the impact of lockdowns in many markets in the second quarter, the industry has still delivered net positive demand growth totals year-to-date. Unlike most other commodities, LNG demand grew 3% year-to-date through September, adding more than 7 million tons of consumption versus last year. The U.S. was the main beneficiary of that growth as exports increased by 34% or 8.3 million tons to approximately 33 million tons year-to-date. Global LNG supplies were highest this year in the first quarter with production falling over the course of the summer to below year ago levels by Q3. LNG production levels decreased 6% or nearly 6 million tons during the third quarter of this year, as supply was curtailed across both U.S. and non-U.S. sources in response to decreasing spot prices as the market became increasingly concerned about exceeding natural gas storage capacity in Europe. The reduction in LNG supply from curtailments helped avert a storage crunch in late summer and position the market to start responding positively to the rebounding gas and LNG demand, we're now seeing in many countries as we head towards the winter season. Now let's look at those trends in more detail in the European and Asian markets. Turning to Slide 10, the global gas market was under pressure throughout the first half of 2020 as a result of a confluence of factors, two consecutive unseasonably warm winters in key LNG demand centers, the coronavirus impacts of course on economic activity and record high storage levels, which one combined led to historically low gas prices worldwide. Today, however, with our indications that point to stabilizing market conditions in terms of both supply and demand, and we're optimistic for continued recovery both in Europe and Asia. In Europe, lower volumes of Russian pipeline gas was the biggest factor helping the region rebalance during the third quarter as pipeline exports to Europe decreased by over 2 Bcf a day year-on-year. Upstream outages and maintenance elsewhere in Europe also cut indigenous production by 1 Bcf a day. In addition, U.S. LNG cargo cancellations from June onward added support to the market, and total LNG imports into Europe decreased 0.9 Bcf a day or 1.7 million tons year-on-year during the third quarter. Gas demand in Europe recovered to 2019 levels in the third quarter. In addition, for the first time, since January 2019, the Eurozone PMI climbed to expansion levels in July and has remained at expansion level since. Eurozone industrial production continues to gradually rise, providing a positive carryover for gas demand and gas-fired power generation across the major European markets has stayed firm despite the decrease in total generation of about 5% year-on-year in Q3. As a result of these factors, European gas prices have recovered from their lows earlier this year, incentivizing LNG customers to resume lifting cargoes from the U.S. Recovery indicators in Asia are also encouraging. LNG imports into the region increased 8.4% during the third quarter, and we're slightly higher year-on-year. Reduced nuclear generation in Japan and gas demand growth in India, Taiwan and China supported LNG use. Year-to-date, aggregate imports into India, Taiwan and China increased by over 8 million tons year-on-year, offsetting part of the decreases in South Korea and other nations. India briefly overtook South Korea in July and August as the world's third largest LNG importer. Lower spot LNG prices drove imports up 10% or 0.6 million tons year-on-year for the third quarter. Decreasing domestic gas production also supported imports and the recent markdown in regulated domestic gas prices could potentially further suppress indigenous production, which is down 10% year-to-date. LNG imports into Taiwan also increased by 9% or 0.4 million tons year-on-year due to summer cooling load. China's LNG demand increased by 13% or 2 million tons year-on-year in third quarter, while domestic production growth slowed and pipe imports continue to decline during the period. The economic recovery in China continued to accelerate with third quarter GDP expanding by about 5% year-on-year, following a 3.2% increase in Q2. Of note, and despite the stresses of the pandemic, policy priorities in China continue to favor broad based adoption of cleaner-burning fuels to displace coal. For example, China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment proposed to have more than 7 million households in North China switched from dispersed coal heating to cleaner-burning options by the end of October. Assuming half of the targeted households undergo coal to gas switching, it's estimated to generate up to 3.5 million tons of LNG equivalent of demand this winter. Finally, I'd like to turn to some longer-term observations. Please turn to Slide 11. As Jack mentioned, one of the most popular and pertinent topics we've been asked about recently is the global energy transition and the role of LNG engineering that transition. We firmly believe in natural gas and LNG as key sources of energy for decades to come, even at the most accelerated energy transition scenarios. The value of our business model and our infrastructure remains intact and provides a source of significant stable, highly visible long-term cash flows over the next almost two decades. And we see tailwinds for further growth, both within and well past that timeline. The chart on the right of that slide show several recent global LNG forecasts, including our own, highlighting a wide range of potential global LNG demand scenarios out to 2040. The variances between forecasts are largely driven by environmental policy assumptions. Clearly, there's significant expected LNG demand growth in almost all forecasts, including IEA's sustainable development scenario. Most consultants predict well over 200 million tons of incremental LNG needed in the market by 2040. Even under the sustainable development scenario, the IEA projects that over 100 million tons of incremental LNG will be needed. We remain confident in our forecast, which is more bullish for LNG growth than the IEA scenarios as we continue to see enduring support for natural gas and LNG throughout multiple policy initiatives in countries and regions around the world that appreciate natural gas is a critical component in achieving environmental policy targets on carbon emissions. We have listed some of these initiatives in key gas and LNG markets in the matrix on the left of the slide for reference. China and India, for example, aim to increase the share of gas in our primary energy mix from 8% and 6%, respectively, to 15% by 2030. This can add over 14 Tcf of gas demand in only a decade in those two countries. Global players are following through on these commitments to environmental goals, supporting long-term increased use of natural gas and LNG in the form of major infrastructure projects. Currently, hundreds of billions of dollars are being invested across Europe and Asia in natural gas projects under construction. And if we include planned commitments, the total is well over a trillion. Some examples include India's commitment to invest over 60 billion to drive its gas-based economy, Europe's commitment of well over 100 billion in gas-fired power, import terminals and pipelines, and China's hundreds of billions of dollars all along the natural gas value chain. We highlight regas capacity, which will not only expand existing import capacities in rapidly growing markets like China and India, but also add nine new import markets, raising the total to over 50 by 2024 from just 15 markets as recently as 2005. The world is facing multiple challenges in the transition to lower carbon future. These challenges vary from region to region, and we recognize that there is no universal solution today. Countries and economies are forced to reconcile economic growth and energy security, energy affordability, and energy intensity challenges while managing their carbon footprint. At Cheniere, we seek to support our customers in helping solve their long-term energy challenges with flexible solutions and providing them the opportunity to improve quality of life and to balance their economies and environmental targets. As a cleaner-burning fuel with far lower emissions than coal or liquid fuels in power generation, natural gas and LNG will play a positive role in ensuring reliable energy supply, balancing power grids, and contributing to a lower carbon energy system globally. And now, I'll hand the call over to Zach to review our financial results. Thanks, Jack. Hi, Jeremy. Yes, as Jack said, it's a market that we have been focused on almost as soon as we became an operating company with our Beijing office opening up in 2017. The team there has done a great job. It's a sign of China's progress, right, this GDP growth, gas demand growth over a Bcf a day of growth in total Chinese gas demand, and almost a Bcf of that came from LNG. Markets are opening up. China is very committed to meeting its 15% objective, type [ph] China was launched at the end of Q3. It is a mechanism to allow other companies to access the market, third-party access to LNG terminals and pipelines, and there's a tremendous amount of gas demand growth. And we are very well-positioned to serve that. So very proud to be in a position to work with foreign energy, one of the fastest growing and up and coming second tier players, and we'll endeavor to find multiple solutions to enable them to meet their downstream objectives of growing gas, maintaining their clean footprint, and finding creative solutions for their customers. So, I'm very proud of the team and hopefully a sign of things to come. No, Jack. Just the flexibility that you hit on allows us to transition from what underpins the seven Trains, which was a very fixed construct of 20 year deals to, as you know, Christine, a lot of flexibility and a lot of creativity as we ensure that we generate the returns that we need, while finding a way to support our customers and creatively adjust to market conditions. I would just add Christine that it's not just the reality of the market, but it really just highlights how durable our EBITDA is. And then it's also just confirmation that we see the ability to hit all of the investment parameters for a project like Stage 3 in this range, signifying how cost competitive Stage 3 really is. Thanks, Michael. Yes. So ever since we started to engage in China in 2016, and then of course, expanded our presence with the Beijing office in 2017. We've been engaged in various discussions, including policy discussions to help China, drive this natural gas penetration in the market, contributed a chapter here and there to the pipe China discussions. And we think that this is a very important step that the policy makers have taken to of course, take a very large amount of infrastructure into a vehicle that is intended to provide third-party access, transparency, drive access to gas, all over the country. And foreign has division to be one of the early movers along that dimension and take advantage of this TPA, as you mentioned with some other contracts that, that BP deal, which proceeded RHOA but it's continuing to grow very aggressively. It isn't a great market in the South China for us to access and to continue to support. We do not see it as a one-off, we think that this is a cadre of companies that we've engaged with for years and looking towards continued success and continued traction there. Thanks, Jack. Just to follow on Jack's comments, as you know, we view Europe as a very attractive and important market for the coming decade and beyond. Europe is investing tremendously in natural gas infrastructure projects in regas pipelines, reversing pipelines, power plants, et cetera, that are all driving natural gas demand. We continue to engage with companies with continue to engage in Brussels, as Jack said, one of our deliverables to that discussion, our transparent metrics are actual numbers that will form the discussion and continue to inform the discussion as opposed to some of the allegations that you've seen out there in the press. And we're delivering those concrete metrics and concrete improvements to that continued engagement with Brussels. There's no universal solution, as we said, we're not going to be everything to all people, but we are confident that we are a key part of the energy transition and part of this solution going forward. And you see examples of that engagement, those infrastructure additions, greater gas and LNG penetration into Europe to meet its strategic objectives of environmental benefits and security of supply. With Asia, yes. So Asia is clearly recovering and Europe is learning how to navigate this issue. Natural gas as you know has been very resilient, even though overall power in the 28 main European markets is down about 5%, natural gas is stable, taking market share away from solid fuels, and this is a very flexible product. And one of the things that we are advantaged in is the ability to respond to these different market moves, whether that is an increase in demand in Asia and a moderation and demand in Europe. That said Europe is in an increasingly better position, we're not facing the issue of storage containment for two reasons. One is, we're finally at levels that have been worked off and are below year ago levels in terms of inventory. And two, obviously going into the winter is a different dynamic than going into the shoulder season of Q2 when we saw that maximum stress and look, we're now nine months into figuring out how to navigate this thing all over the world, and that's improving the outlook as well. So not taking our eye off the ball by any means, but we're endowed with a flexible responsive system that we and our customers know much better how to navigate. Thanks Alex, this is Anatol. I'll start, then I'll hand it over to Jack on the second part. But we are \u2013 clearly the market globally has a forward structure that, says, winter is marginally more valuable than summer. Our efforts \u2013 our commercial efforts have grown leaps and bounds in terms of sophistication and you can look up the original SPAs and see that they make a fairly big deal, most of them make a fairly big deal about being ratable. We could now price things, and affect that solution much more flexibly and easily. And that is a discussion that we have from time-to-time with our customers. So we have no issues with that, and then on top of that, as you know, we have some seasonality in terms of our production capacity, when it's nice and cool in Louisiana, the ops guys have an easier time making more of it. So we evaluate all of these options and normalize them and factor that into our decision of how to move forward. Thanks, Sean. Yes, so the markets continued to grow dramatically over the past decades, conveniently doubled every decade. And historically when this was a very bespoke sort of point-to-point market, the contractual solutions were fairly standard at that 20 year mark. And as you said, there was a very large amount of volume that reprices, if you will, over the coming years and decades. And that is one of the sources of opportunity for us to take advantage of that. The solutions that the customers will want will vary, there will be a portfolio approach we believe and lots of customers will want the flexible transparent pricing, stable pricing that our long-term contracts offer, others will choose to recontract mid-term, and that's something that we can help with as well as load following if you will, that we can provide at the margin. So, it is another very large opportunity as that volume reprices out of the legacy projects out of North Africa, Qatar, et cetera. Thanks, Ben. Yes, this is Anatol. We've always said that we're optimistic on the IPM business and see a number of opportunities there, but it is not a huge sample sets. EOG is a wonderful partner, obviously that IPM transaction started this year, it's been a challenging year for all producers. And as you can imagine, discussions while ongoing are not top of mind, like they were a year or year and a half ago. But we firmly see that the growth of North American production needs to be exported. And we provide the single largest access points to those markets. So we're optimistic that engagement will become more robust as we move forward. And certainly EOG's contribution will be front and center as well as a handful of other large credit worthy counterparties that have positions that are proximal to our facilities. Thanks, Ben."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Jack Fusco",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for your continued support to Cheniere. We have a lot to cover this morning. I'd like to start by thanking the Cheniere professionals that make my job look so easy. As you will see from our results and guidance, it has been a challenging and rewarding quarter during an unimaginable year. This year continues to present us with surprising challenges, and we at Cheniere continue to rise to those challenges, maintain our focus, and execute. I'm extremely proud of the results we're reporting today. You often hear me speak about the resiliency of our people, our assets, and our business model that has certainly been reinforced today as not only have we navigated the continued direct and indirect challenges of COVID-19 and a difficult global LNG market, but also the added challenges of two major hurricanes recently making landfall near Sabine Pass. While Sabine Pass suffered no significant damage from either Hurricane Laura or Hurricane Delta, many of our co-workers, friends, neighbors, and other members of the Cheniere family were impacted with lost or damaged homes. We are proud to have responded to those natural disasters quickly and impactfully in support of our employees with shelter and clothing in the communities where we live and work in Southwest Louisiana with $1 million donation, and a supply drive with the Astros where we delivered two semi-tractor trailers full of goods. We also managed volatility in the LNG market over the quarter. When the third quarter commenced, we're in a period of relatively high cargo cancellations and low facility utilization. By the time we exited the quarter, LNG market conditions had materially strengthened, which allowed us to ramp up production and capture additional margin. Throughout this year's volatility, our visibility to achieving full year 2020 financial results within the guidance ranges remain virtually unchanged. Additionally, we've received an increasing number of questions from our shareholders regarding the global energy transition in the role of natural gas and LNG in a lower carbon future. Natural gas is an affordable, reliable, cleaner burning global fuel source, and we are confident in natural gas playing an increasingly important role in the global energy mix for many years as countries set carbon neutrality goals for the second half of this century. Cheniere delivers abundant cleaner burning natural gas from North America to the rest of the world. So, it can displace dirtier fuel sources like coal and oil, helping these countries achieve their environmental goals. We remain steadfast on allocating capital to the most attractive risk-adjusted opportunities for continued growth in our core liquefaction platform as we simultaneously seek to optimize our environmental footprint and support our customers and their downstream economies and achieving their long-term energy security and environmental goals. Please turn to Slide 5. This year with cargo cancellations, our quarterly results have been difficult for you all to predict. As a reminder, during the second quarter, our long-term customers utilized optionality in their contracts by canceling cargoes at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi. For cargoes canceled during 2Q, that would have been delivered to our customers in 3Q, the revenue related to those cargoes over $450 million was brought forward and recognized in 2Q since our obligations to deliver those cargoes were extinguished. During the third quarter of 2020, we only generated $477 million of consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow of over $190 million on revenues of approximately $1.5 billion. Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter was $463 million. Despite a challenging 2020, I am pleased to once again confirm our 2020 full-year guidance range of $3.8 billion to $4.1 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion in distributable cash flow. I'm also pleased to report that we are currently tracking to the midpoint of the EBITDA range and the high end of the DCF range as the market has improved, and we continue to execute and optimize. Looking ahead to 2021, we look forward to delivering growth in our financial metrics, driven primarily by the expected completion and commencement of operations of Train 3 at Corpus Christi early next year. I am pleased today to introduce full year 2021 guidance of $3.9 billion to $4.2 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA, and $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in distributable cash flow. Construction progress continues to reinforce our legacy of best-in-class execution. [Indiscernible] progressing Corpus Christi Train 3 and Sabine Pass Train 6 on accelerated schedules well ahead of the guaranteed timelines and within budget. Corpus Christi Train 3 is about 97% complete, and the commissioning process is progressing very well with feed gas introduced into the train in October. We expect first LNG production from Train 3 in the coming weeks. [Indiscernible] now predict substantial completion in the first quarter of 2021. Sabine Pass Train 6 is approximately 71% complete. [Indiscernible] continues to project substantial completion in the second half of 2022, having recently accelerated that timeframe. Once again, during the third quarter, Zach and the finance team were very busy executing on our financial strategy. Year-to-date, we have raised over $8.5 billion from our banks and institutional capital providers in support of our long-term financial strategies and priorities. Zach will cover our third quarter capital raising activity, which was highlighted for the successful issuance of our inaugural bond for Cheniere Energy, later on this call. Now turn to Slide 6, where I'll discuss our upwardly revised run rate production guidance and its strategic implications. Our efforts to maximize LNG production have yielded continuous improvement in our per train run rate production forecast, which helped drive the range of our run rate financial guidance. At our Analyst Day in 2017, we originally forecast run rate production of 4.3 million to 4.6 million tons per annum per train. Today, we're raising that level once again to 4.9 million to 5.1 million tons per annum as our operational expertise, our maintenance optimization, and our debottlenecking programs continue to produce incremental and reliable production from our existing infrastructure platform. From our initial guidance, these increases have added an aggregate of up to 7 million tons per year of additional marketable LNG or virtually an entire additional train. This incremental volume has strategic implications for Cheniere from a high level. It means we are less contracted on a run rate basis than we were before. And based on our disciplined approach to capital investment decisions, we have incremental volume to sell prior to sanctioning any new infrastructure. Make no mistake, Corpus Christi Stage 3 is shovel-ready and one of the most cost competitive LNG projects worldwide, but we are committed to capital discipline, and we'll only sanction that project when it meets or exceeds our financial capital investment parameters. Our most important metric is the level of contracted commercialization of our production. We've historically targeted a minimum of 80% of our production under contract, but as we continue to improve on our operation and maintenance management are more comfortable with increasing that contracted production target to up to 90%. Therefore, our commercial efforts are squarely focused on this incremental volume today. Meaning the timing of Stage 3 FID will be dependent upon firming up, not just Stage 3 but this virtual additional train worth of production, as well. As we enter into additional commitments across our platform, we will continue to deploy time and resources to ensure that Stage 3 remains as competitive and efficient as possible. This incremental production is already in our portfolio and available for our marketing and origination teams to contract on a short, medium or long-term basis. The fact that this production requires no meaningful additional capital, nor is it dependent on the sanctioning of new infrastructure gives us immense flexibility to tailor the structure of these agreements, to the needs of our customers. Now turn to Slide 7, on several of our recent quarterly calls, I've spent time highlighting our ESG efforts, including our company-wide focus on the challenges and opportunities, these important topics present, our climate and sustainability principles in our enhanced disclosures highlighted by the publication of our inaugural corporate responsibility report earlier this year. I view the growing importance of ESG in general and the emphasis on decarbonation specifically as significant tailwind to our business. As I said earlier, we're confident that natural gas and particularly LNG has a key role to play in the global transition to a lower carbon future, given its place at the intersection of reliably powering economic activity and providing a cleaner energy source worldwide. With that being said, I'd like to take the discussion one step further and give you a sense of how we are synthesizing this information and integrating it into our strategic priorities. At Cheniere, we are in a unique position to bring about change when considering the diverse group of partners across our entire business from upstream suppliers to our wide range of LNG customers and shipping providers. Individually and collectively, our reach and relationships provide us strong framework to enable the integration of climate solutions that will improve Cheniere's footprint and help ensure our partners across the full value chain realize the full environmental benefits from our LNG. To carry out this integration, we are methodically reviewing our business to quantify our life cycling missions and to identify and analyze climate related opportunities across our value chain, with strategic goals of resiliency, transparency, avoidance, and reduction. I'd like to touch on a couple of these efforts briefly. First, we're analyzing our life cycle greenhouse gas emissions across Cheniere's value chain and evaluating the areas where we have direct and indirect control. While we have achieved a one-third reduction in Scope 1 greenhouse gas emission intensities from 2016 to 2019. We continue to seek ways to further reduce the environmental footprint of our own operations, including assessing the economic and operational feasibility of CO2 management solutions at Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi. Outside of our facilities, we're looking both upstream and downstream at climate focused opportunities. These efforts involve collaborating with our partners throughout the value chain to identify and pursue actionable solutions. While our efforts are relatively early stage, we're encouraged by the mutual support for these pursuits, from our value chain partners. Along these lines, we're actively pursuing opportunities in each of the following areas, LNG shipping, gas procurement and transportation, renewable power procurement, digitization, operations and supply chain management. In addition, we continue to evaluate offering environmentally beneficial products and services at our facilities that compliment our core business and leverage our infrastructure position such as LNG bunkering services for the marine fuel market. Each of these initiatives has a potential to not only positively impact the environmental profile of Cheniere and our LNG, but also the industry at large, earning returns for our shareholders and solidifying LNG's and Cheniere's foothold in supporting growing energy demand worldwide through the century. And now I'll turn the call over to Anatol, who will provide an update on the LNG market. Hi Jeremy, how are you? Jeremy, I'll start, and then I'll turn it over to Anatol. First, thanks for the question. Look, we \u2013 I firmly believe Cheniere has the best Chinese origination office in Beijing of any of the LNG providers. I'm very pleased with my team. We \u2013 as you know, we were one and only to sign a long-term \u2013 the only to sign a long-term agreement with China early on in 2018, and our relationship there just continues to grow stronger and stronger. We've sent a significant amount of spot cargoes to China here recently. I'll let Anatol address the... A few things there, but thanks, Jeremy. First off, we're in ongoing discussions every quarter with the Board about capital allocation, whether it be debt paydown, share buybacks, or eventually a dividend, but when you look at what the share price is right now, and we're talking about $11 DCF per share in a couple of years, the decision is still pretty easy that it's going to be share buybacks. But in terms of your numbers, you're right. We have around $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion of DCF next year, but keep in mind, we'll still have a couple hundred million left at Corpus, and we have other \u2013 a few other debottlenecking and development costs that we'll be spending on. So, it's not all free cash flow. You have to strip that out first. But for the year, yes, we have around $1 billion of free cash flow next year for a company that really was just negative for 20 years previously. Thank you, Michael. So, I'm going to address that directly. So first off, look, we have the best team of Cheniere professionals that, that exist. It is a \u2013 it's a team that is very experienced from around the world not only with ConocoPhillips optimization, designs, but also ATI and a whole host of other things, and we have the benefit of having the full value chain, meaning the gas procurement side and our ability to deliver gas at varying pressures and heat content, which really influenced the performance of the trains. The team has done a fantastic job with what we call it debottlenecking, but also maintenance optimization and trying to extend the periods between defrost, extend our turbine, overhauls with Baker Hughes, and as well as hitting all the bottlenecks throughout the train. So, I feel very good that we continue to pluck what I call the low-hanging fruit. I think there's more room for us to go. I don't think we're done yet, and what it gives us a ton of flexibility with our customers to design solutions for them without having to have CPC on additional infrastructure. I don't want to comment on any of the other LNG facilities, because they're all a little bit different from a technological perspective, but we feel very good about where we're able to achieve. Yes. Hi Christine, thank you. And first let me address the first part going from 80% to 90%, that's still the \u2013 my comfort with raising our contracted amount, if you will, is with my comfort in my operating and maintenance staff at the facilities. Again, their performance has been fantastic this year. We've been thrown everything. Everything has been thrown at us and we've continued to perform and outperform, I think what everyone's expectations were. So as we get more and more comfortable with our stability of operations and our reliability, it allows us to fill more comfortable with terming out our production. So as far as the cost, there's \u2013 or the price of the fixed fee, there's a lot of different variables we can draw upon with that. And we can go out longer in term or shorter in term or if the quantity is bigger and longer than we may give them a little more of a discount for lack of a better word, but we have a lot of flexibility in what we're able to offer. And as we turn things up, you should expect those to flow into our guidance and be reflected in our numbers. Anatol, do you have anything to add on that? The short answer is, yes. Thanks, Christine. We see the, again, a growing market for LNG and we think that it is supplied in large part by U.S. projects, our project. They are cost competitive in that 2 to 2.50 range on a delivered basis. That's how we evaluate both ourselves and our global competition. And we think that as we move through this period of oversupply with four years of record volumes coming into the market, record growth for the LNG market that ensued, the period of Q2 and Q3 that we just went through the rate at which the market rebounded is fairly astonishing and absorbed and continued to invest in this future project that will drive medium to long-term growth, which we'll need to dispatch these $2 plus margin projects. So we were looking through the cycle between what we have in the books today, of course, as well as where we see the market playing out over the coming years and decades. We're very comfortable with this 2 to 2.50 range. Good, Michael. How are you? And Michael, I have to say that, one of the issues structurally in China is that the Citygate natural gas prices didn't fluctuate with actual gas prices. So when the spot prices dropped, China's demand didn't increase because the Citygate price was kept artificially high. Now you're going to see some of that flow through with some of these other players and pipe China, to where they can access lower \u2013 potentially lower prices and you'll see the demand response increase also. So we're extremely supportive of the reforms. Well, I'll take it a couple of different ways. As you know, a lot of our foundation customers are European. We have two very large French companies that are long-term foundation customers, both total and electricity to fonts and the focus on decarbonisation is here. It's here to stay. It hasn't come up with us yet, but we are anticipating it. We're moving forward with quantifying what we can do to make our product much more desirable in the event that need to as you know, from my talking points from manifests talking points, our initial focus is on identifying and pursuing actionable scientific near-term solutions that we can lower our carbon footprint. We do think the whole energy transition discussion is going to be a very long road and take a whole lot of everything to make work. But go ahead, Anatol. Sure. So again, we're transitioning from a period in our corporate evolution where everything needed to meet the objective of supporting essentially project financing. And as we've talked about, we have this additional capacity. We have the success of the operations team. We've proved the construct of this integrated value chain. And now have the flexibility of altering these commercial solutions and coming up with products that serve our customer's needs. And those products include a midterm product, as well as the shorter term solutions that we've always had and the long-term. We think this market is a market it'll continue to evolve, it will continue to be cyclical. And all of those components short, medium and long-term will be part of the conversation in the LNG market for decades to come. So we're very happy to be in a position to offer that. And as you said, yes, secure margin and have that stability of cash flow, which we know is important to all of our investors. Are you mean they made run rate or 2021? To make it simple, it's really on that open capacity that we were speaking to, but I'd like to give you just a better sense of the year ahead. So for 2021, we'll have eight Trains for the first time. And we're going to have record production of high-30s in terms of mtpa for the year. So last year, when we went into 2020, we had about 2 million tons open, which translated into around a 100 TBtu, in which is why we said a move of $1 was about a $100 million to EBITDA. But this year, we're adding that eighth Train and saying our long-term contracts and selling forward leaves us with around 200 TBtu or just less than 4 million tons currently open, which gets us to that 90% total contract for 2021. So that we were closer to 95% last year to 90% this year going into 2021, and just keep in mind that we've got a train coming online early next year. But I'd say we're actually pretty similar, if not in a better spot than last year, considering that asymmetric upside. So margins currently are in the sub $1 range, meaning downside in EBITDA is really capped at around $100 million, which makes it more insulated than last year. But we still have that upside for every dollar is $200 million. So we're in a pretty good spot and you can imagine we just did budget for the year and when we come up with a range, it's around budget in the midpoint. Thank you. Hey, Michael, this is Jack, I'll start here also. I mean, this is \u2013 it's been an incredible year. We have put a lot of precautions into our besides and our plans around COVID with biometrics screening, with isolating the workforce, et cetera. And I know that the numbers at least here around Houston and Louisiana and Texas have increased, but we haven't seen any of the increase in cases ourselves with our workforce, which is it's little bit interesting, but we are definitely on guard, as far as our customers so far, as Anatol pointed out, the recovery, especially in Asia has been more v-shaped, it continues to be stronger every day, but Anatol, maybe you want to give more color on Europe or... And, in regards to the Conoco, they've been a good partner with us, Ryan Lance is a good friend and they've supported us in our debottlenecking and optimization efforts, throughout this whole process. I think their announcement was on future COP trains, but having said that, every time we do better, the licensing fee goes up, so they're helping us as much as they possibly can. And I would say that the customers are demanding more energy diversity, so they don't want to buy from one supplier necessarily. They want to buy from multiple suppliers and ensure a reliable product. They're also looking at diversity from a \u2013 how much do they want oil index versus Henry hub index. And so, I think we'll get our fair share of some of those contracts. And we just continue to try to work on our operational excellence and make sure that they consider us to be an affordable, reliable supplier of LNG. Yes, and that's exactly what we're doing right now is when we say we're \u2013 our initial focus is on identifying and pursuing we're stacking them up. So we know directly and indirectly what the carbon footprint looks like for a cargo of LNG at least from a calculated basis, not an actual basis, which is one of the solutions we'd like to get resolved. But we are quickly identifying, prioritizing and stacking them up on which ones we make economic sense and which we're going to have to put on the back burner for a while until the market wants to pay us for those types of solutions. Sure. So we've really slowly and steadily increased the CQP distribution over the last few years because we're still in construction. So you'll see us \u2013 we just have increased it by $0.02 annualized, and we'll continue to do that until we finished Train 6. So you could see what range we gave for this coming year and it's about the same type of step up as it was this previous year. And that's really related to just holding back the cash to make sure we can fund the remaining, let's say $900 million or so of unlevered CapEx for Train 6. But clearly on the run rate, it did go up. But if you look at the numbers, it didn't go up all that much, but it is almost at $4 at this point. And the reason for that is because we have an IDR structure. So at this point, since we're in the high split, 50% of every incremental dollar actually goes to CEI. So eventually in terms of distributed cash flow, when we get to $3 billion at CEI, a little over half of that is actually distributions going to us from not just the LP units, but from those IDRs. And thank you everybody, thanks for your support of Cheniere."

            "content": "Thanks, Anatol, and good morning, everyone. Also hope everyone is doing well. I'm pleased to be here today to review our third quarter financial results, discuss our 2021 increased run rate guidance, and provide an update on our capital markets initiatives and capital allocation priorities. Turning to Slide 13. For the third quarter, we generated a net loss of $463 million, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $477 million and distributable cash flow of over $190 million. As Jack mentioned, our third quarter results were significantly impacted by the accelerated recognition of revenues in the second quarter, related to canceled cargoes that were scheduled to be delivered in the third quarter. As the global LNG market has begun to return to balance, the number of cancellations for fourth quarter cargoes has declined, meaning that the revenue acceleration that occur in the second quarter did not recur in the third quarter with fourth quarter results positioned to normalize. For the nine months ended September 30, we reported net income of $109 million, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.9 billion and distributable cash flow of over $1 billion. Through September 30, we exported 920 TBtu of LNG from our liquefaction projects, including the 193 TBtu of LNG or 55 cargos during the third quarter. Total volumes produced and exported in the third quarter were 30%, more than 80 TBtu, lower than exports in the second quarter of this year, as cargo cancellations continued into and peaked during the shoulder season in the third quarter. For the third quarter, we recognized an income 168 TBtu of LNG produced at our liquefaction projects and 31 TBtu of LNG sourced from third-parties. Approximately 74% of the LNG volumes recognized in income during the third quarter was sold under either long-term SBAs or IPM agreements, a proportion materially consistent with the second quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, we recognized an income 932 TBtu of LNG produced at our liquefaction projects and 79 TBtu of LNG sourced from third-parties. Approximately 77% of the year-to-date LNG volumes recognized an income was sold under either long-term SBAs or IPM agreements. As a reminder, during the second and third quarters, our results were materially impacted by the timing of revenue recognition related to cargo cancellations. In the second quarter, we recognized $458 million of revenues related to canceled cargoes that would have been delivered during the third quarter. During the third quarter, we recognized $47 million of revenues related to canceled cargoes that would have been delivered during fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of out-of-period cargo cancellations, our third quarter revenues of $1.46 billion would have been approximately $1.87 billion. The impact on consolidated adjusted EBITDA is similar to the impact on revenue. Income from operations for the third quarter was $72 million, a decrease of over $850 million compared to the second quarter, driven primarily by the accelerated recognition of revenues in the second quarter for canceled cargoes that would have been delivered in the third quarter; partially offset by decreased costs incurred in response to COVID-19 pandemic during the third quarter. Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter was $463 million or negative $1.84 per share, an increase of $650 million from the second quarter of 2020. This increased net loss was driven primarily by the decrease in income from operations, increased loss on modification or extinguishment of debt, primarily related to redeeming the remaining CCH Holdco II notes and a portion of our 2021 convertible notes, and increased loss in our equity method investments, partially offset by decreased income attributable to non-controlling interest, increased tax benefit, decreased interest expense, and decreased interest rate derivative loss. Before turning to guidance and capital allocation priorities, I'd like to briefly touch on key financing transactions during the third quarter. As we've discussed in our prior call, we redeemed the remaining outstanding CCH Holdco II convertible notes and a significant portion of our 2021 convertible notes in July using the Cheniere term loan, in a transaction which both address near-term and relatively high-cost maturities and prevented significant share dilution, reducing our run rate share count by over 40 million shares. In August, Corpus Christi Holdings or CCH received its third and final investment-grade rating, when Moody's upgraded CCH's senior debt to a rating of Baa3. The upgrade from Moody's is one of the few, if not the only upgrade from high yield to investment grade in all of energy in 2020. And further reinforces the credit quality of our project level economics that are the foundation of this company. Following the upgrade, CCH opportunistically issued $769 million, a 3.52% senior secured notes due 2039 in a private placement transaction, securing the lowest yielding bond ever across the Cheniere complex. The proceeds from the issuance were used to prepay a portion of the CCH credit facility. In September, we refinanced a portion of the outstanding Cheniere Term Loan balance via issuance of an inaugural bond at CEI, which Jack highlighted a few minutes ago. This successful issuance was outsized to $2 billion and priced at 4.58% coupon reflecting the strength with which the debt capital markets use our business model and operational capability. Strategically, this was a very important transaction for us as it established CEI as a corporate issuer with a path to future unsecured issuances, a critical step in our long-term capital strategy. We remain committed to debt migration from our operating companies to our parent level companies to improve project level resiliency, reduce structural subordination at CEI and be secured the balance sheet over time, while also targeting investment grade ratings across the Cheniere complex. Also during the quarter, infrastructure funds managed by Blackstone and Brookfield purchased an over 40% stake in CQP from Blackstone Energy Partners, which had owned since 2012. Infrastructure funds at Blackstone and Brookfield are among the largest global long-term infrastructure investors and the investment made in CQP is a testament to the quality of our contracted LNG asset platform and to the long-term role of Cheniere and LNG in meeting growing energy demand worldwide. Turn now to Slide 14, driven by continued excellence in operations and execution and despite a myriad of challenges this year. We are again reconfirming our 2020 full year guidance of consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $3.8 billion to $4.1 billion and distributed cash flow of $1 billion to $1.3 billion. As we look forward to the remainder of 2020, we've hedged virtually all of our remaining expected production volumes and do not expect meaningful variability as a result of any moves in market pricing. Today, we are issuing 2021 consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance of $3.9 billion to $4.2 billion, distributable cash flow guidance of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion and CQP distribution guidance of $2.60 to $2.70 per unit. The largest variable in our projected financial results for 2021 is the timing of completion of Corpus Christi Train 3, and our guidance assumes a late first quarter completion of that train. While we have pre-sold approximately 90% of our total expected production capacity for next year, consistent with previous years, we currently forecast that a $1 change in market margin would impact EBITDA by approximately $200 million for full year 2021, with the variability disproportionately weighted to the upside and downside limited to approximately half of that amount given sub $1 margins on average across the calendar year in the market today. Today, we are also pleased to revise upward our run rate financial guidance driven by increased run rate production guidance as Jack described. Increasing the operating capacity of our existing infrastructure drives increased EBITDA and cash flow and increases our return on investment. As we have increased production guidance by over half an mtpa per train is essentially received an extra trains worth of production in our nine train platform. Today, we are raising our nine train run rate consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance to $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion and distributable cash flow guidance to $2.6 billion to $3 billion. Our run rate financial guidance ranges assume production of 4.9 to 5.1 mtpa per train and marketing margins of $2 to $2.50 per MMBtu. We are also increasing our run rate distributable cash flow per share guidance to $10.25 to $11.75 per share, an increase of $2 or over 20% at the midpoint from our prior DCF per share guidance, driven both by increased run rate DCF expectations and a decrease in run rate shares outstanding by over $40 million as a result of the settlement of the CCH Holdco II and the 2021 Cheniere convertible notes in cash as opposed to equity. Please turn now to Slide 15. In addition to expected growth in both consolidated to adjusted EBITDA distributable cash flow next year, we also forecast 2021 to be an inflection point for free cash flow. And we expect to generate significant positive free cash flow for the first time in Cheniere's history. As we continue the commissioning process in near completion of Corpus Christi Train 3, we expect a dramatic reduction in capital commitments and an increase in operational cash flow in 2021, leaving a significant amount of free cash flow, which will give us added flexibility on capital allocation. One of our primary long-term balance sheet priorities is achieving investment grade ratings at the Cheniere level by the early to mid-2020s, in order to solidify our long-term balance sheet provide stability to our run rate cash flow per share guidance. Due to the incremental debt we took on to address the convertible notes in the third quarter, our capital allocation priority over the short and medium-term will be debt pay down. Executing on that priority, we prepaid $100 million of the Cheniere Term Loan in the third quarter. And we expect to do the same during the fourth quarter. And we expect to pay down at least another $0.5 billion of debt during 2021, while still having additional free cash flow. As we forecast our cash flow generation profile and debt reduction plans through 2021. To fortify our current CEI ratings and remain on track for investment grade metrics in the coming years, we expect to be in a position in the second half of the year once Corpus Christi Train 3 is ramped up to resume capital returns via our existing buyback program by potentially initiating a dividend or both. We view a dividend at LNG as an eventuality as the long-term, highly contracted nature of our business model is ideally suited for it over time. We will evaluate timing and magnitude with our Board and in consideration of market conditions, our balance sheet and the stock price. We currently forecast the significant amount of available cash over the next five years, approximately $12 billion. And this amount is expected to provide us flexibility to reduce their consolidated debt and achieve investment grade ratings at the Cheniere level to return capital to shareholders via buybacks and/or dividends, and be in a position to invest in cash flow and credit accretive growth projects, such as Corpus Christi Stage 3 that meet our contractual and investment return parameters. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions. I was just going to say, putting in perspective, we're 38, 39 mtpa contracted and we originally thought this would be a 40 million ton portfolio and we've got 45 million tons. So we have some work to do to just contract that up, give everybody even more, certainty on those cash flows gives us a better sense of capital allocation at the same time. But then when it comes to Stage 3 and projects like that, yeah, we're going to be looking for the same creditworthy long-term contracts to justify another multi-billion dollar build-out."

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Randy Bhatia, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.\nRandy Bhatia: Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone, and welcome to Cheniere's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. The slide presentation and access to the webcast for today's call are available at cheniere.com. Joining me today are Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO; Anatol Feygin, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Zach Davis, Senior Vice President and CFO. Before we begin, I would like to remind all listeners that our remarks, including answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from what is described in these statements. Slide 2 of our presentation contains a discussion of those forward-looking statements and associated risks. In addition, we may include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measure can be found in the appendix to the slide presentation. As part of our discussion of Cheniere's results, today's call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP or CQP. We do not intend to cover CQP's results separately from those of Cheniere Energy Inc. The call agenda is shown on slide 3. Jack will begin with operating and financial highlights, Anatol will then provide an update on the LNG market and Zach will review our financial results and guidance. After prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO.\nJack Fusco : Thank you, Randy, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our results from the second quarter of 2020. We had an outstanding quarter, especially considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and energy markets, on how people live and work and how companies worldwide have had to adapt through everyday operations. The current environment has presented challenges, but the resiliency of our customer-oriented business and the professionalism and resolute focus of the Cheniere workforce continues to deliver outcomes, which benefit all of our stakeholders. The second quarter was highlighted by a number of significant achievements across multiple phases of our business and our visibility on achieving our 2020 financial targets remain steadfast. Before I get started though, I'm sure you noticed this morning's personnel announcement of the departure of Michael Wortley, as Cheniere's CFO. I want to personally thank Michael for standing by my side over the last four years. And more importantly, for all of his contributions to Cheniere's success over the last close to 16 years. Michael will be missed and we wish him well on his future endeavors. Succession planning and employee development are core principles here at Cheniere and for our Board. And I am pleased to announce that effective immediately Zach Davis, our Senior Vice President of Finance will assume the role of Chief Financial Officer. Zach has been with Cheniere for nearly seven years, during which time he has led our capital markets activities and has also been responsible for capital planning, financial planning and in the corporate budget. Please join me in congratulating Zach on his new role and you will hear more from him later on this call. Now turn to slide 5. In the second quarter of 2020, we generated $1.4 billion of consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow of approximately $570 million on revenues of $2.4 billion. This resulted in net income attributable to common stockholders of approximately $200 million. Despite continued challenges in the LNG market environment, driven by short-term supply and demand dynamics that are amplified by the impacts of the pandemic. I'm pleased today to reconfirm our 2020 full year guidance ranges of $3.8 billion to $4.1 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion in distributable cash flow. This further illustrates Cheniere's strength and resiliency of our business model and contract structures and our ability to execute on our plan. During the second quarter our long-term customers further utilized the optionality in their contracts by canceling cargoes at both SBL and CCL. As you know, this results in customers paying us the fixed liquefaction fee related to those cargoes and extinguishes our obligation to produce those cargoes. As we discussed in our call last quarter, when this situation occurs we recognize the revenue associated with those cargoes upon receipt of the notice of cancellation, which creates a timing mismatch when looking at our business on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Zach will discuss this in more detail in his remarks. During the second quarter, we produced and exported 78 cargoes of LNG. Since the start-up of operations, we have produced and exported over 80 million tons of LNG from our projects, which has reached over 35 countries and regions around the world. In May, the date of first commercial delivery or DFCD was reached under the long-term SBAs related to Train 2 at Corpus Christi. We have successfully onboarded these long-term customers and we welcome them to the Cheniere complex. While the environment in the spot LNG market remains relatively weak, I'm encouraged that dynamics in the LNG market are improving and unfolding as we have expected. As worldwide economies have begun to recover from the pandemic, we are beginning to see short-term gas prices stabilize and spreads are beginning to improve as we look into the winter months and beyond. The long-term fundamentals supporting our business remain firmly intact as a structural shift to clean burning natural gas continues to progress. Anatol will provide a more fulsome update on the global LNG market momentarily. Our current construction efforts continue our legacy of best-in-class execution. Bechtel is constructing Corpus Christi Train 3 and Sabine Pass Train 6 on accelerated schedules, well ahead of guaranteed time lines and within budget. Corpus Christi Train 3 is over 90% complete and Bechtel commenced early commissioning activities on Train 3 during the second quarter introduced first fuel gas in early July and is maintaining a substantial completion estimate of the first half of next year. We certainly look forward to taking care custody and control of the eight train from Bechtel ahead of schedule and within budget early next year. Sabine Pass Train 6 is approximately 64% complete. And Bechtel has recently informed us of an acceleration to the Train 6 timeline now projecting substantial completion to be achieved in the second half of 2022 ahead of the previous estimate of the first half of 2023. In addition, we recently issued full notice to proceed to Bechtel on the construction of the third marine birth at Sabine Pass and that project is expected to be complete in the first half of 2023. Our finance team was very busy during the second quarter and they were extremely successful in executing our financial strategy. In aggregate, we raised almost $4.7 billion through early July strategically addressing near-term maturities and replacing higher cost debt across multiple entities within the Cheniere structure. I'll touch upon a couple of the transactions. First in May, we refinanced the nearest term maturity in our complex by issuing $2 billion, a 4.5% notes due 2030 at Sabine Pass liquefaction. Then we raised a three-year delayed draw term loan at Cheniere of almost $2.7 billion in order to redeem the 2025 convertible notes issued by Corpus Christi Holdco II and a portion of the 2021 convertible notes issued by Cheniere. This flexible cost effective bank capital enables us to settle the convertible notes with cash as opposed to issuing equity, preventing dilution, which we had previously modeled in our run rate guidance. While we did not repurchase shares under our share repurchase program during the second quarter these strategic transactions resulted in a reduction in run rate share count of over 40 million shares. That's all of Zach's thunder that I'll steal on the refinancings. But investors should recognize that these are material accomplishments, which not only address near-term maturities and relatively high cost debt, but also demonstrate our strong ability to access the capital markets even in this period of volatility and uncertainty, which speaks to the reputation and strength of Cheniere's business with our banks and institutional capital providers. Now turn to slide 6. In early July, we published our inaugural corporate responsibility report titled, First and Forward. The publication of this report represents a significant step forward in Cheniere's commitment to transparency and sustainability reporting and will form the foundation of our disclosures around ESG risks and opportunities going forward. The development of this report was led by Chris Smith, our Senior VP of Policy Government and Public Affairs; our dedicated climate and sustainability team; and by a cross-functional team of subject matter experts from nearly every business unit within the company because ESG issues touch nearly every business unit within the company. The report identifies and reports on approximately 70 key disclosures across six-key things; climate, environment, workforce, health and safety, community and governance. Our key themes and disclosures in line with the recommendations of a leading reporting standards such as the taskforce on climate related financial disclosures, or TCFD, the sustainability accounting standards board and others. Sustainability is a priority at Cheniere and our urgency to address the key considerations of ESG issues is core to our operations and shared values. As such we are committed to transparency and how we report on these issues. We have an excellent evolving story to tell on environmental social and governance issues and we hope this message is communicated clearly in our inaugural report. And now, I'll turn the call over to Anatol, who will provide an update on the LNG market.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks Jack and good morning everyone. Please turn to slide 8. I'll start by reviewing the trends we observed throughout the first half of 2020, then highlight the factors that we think will continue to impact the global LNG supply and demand dynamics going forward. Many of these factors started to become apparent late in the second quarter. And we believe they bring into focus two main themes, the flexibility of the global LNG supply system and the resilience of LNG as a fuel choice. Global LNG supplies increased 6% year-on-year in the first half of 2020, reaching 188 million tons. The U.S. contributed most of this LNG production growth with exports rising 64% year-on-year to approximately 26 million tons. However, supply growth for the first half of this year was at a lower rate than the significant growth in LNG supply that began several years ago, as the current cycle of supply additions started to slow and as global liquefaction supply adjusted output downwards to adapt to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on gas demand. Most measures introduced to contain the coronavirus including city lockdowns and restrictions on travel impacted gas demand and LNG markets in the second quarter. With weak LNG demand in Asia, more global production was pushed into Europe, resulting in record seasonal gas inventory levels and exerting downward pressure on spot gas prices in Europe and Asia. During the second quarter, TTF averaged $1.76 per MMBtu, approximately 60% lower than the comparable 2019 period, while JKM averaged $2.58 in MMBtu during the second quarter, 50% lower year-on-year. By late May, the combination of supply side flexibility demonstrated by U.S. and global operations with a gradual recovery in LNG demand in India China and the Middle East had reduced the flow of surplus LNG cargoes to Europe. Global LNG supply trended down for the third consecutive month in June, dropping slightly below the levels of the second quarter of 2019. The global supply utilization decreased to 82% on average in the second quarter this year versus 93% in the first quarter. As a result, LNG supply growth turned negative in the second quarter, declining by about one million tons ending a six quarter run of supply additions which averaged close to 10 million tons each quarter. While it\u2019s too early to call this a bullish market, we believe the recent slowdown in production is constructive in the near term and reduces the risk of reaching maximum natural gas storage levels too early in the year at European storage facilities. Now turn to slide 9, where I will address the European market in some more detail. The four residual LNG cargoes to Europe continued through a significant portion of the second quarter despite gas consumption declines, resulting from measures put in place to fight the spread of COVID-19. LNG imports into Europe grew 6.7 million tons or about 15% year-on-year during the first half of 2020. Consumption data however suggests that gas demand in Europe declined nearly 8% or 4.5 Bcf a day during this period due to a mix of weather and COVID 19 impact. Sharp declines in LNG imports into Europe began in June and have continued into July. These decreases have played an important role in helping ease the European storage surplus from 15 BCM or over 0.5 trillion cubic feet in May to six bcm or just over 200 Bcf at present. LNG is not the only lever that impacts over supply risk in the current gas market environment in Europe. As you might expect, pipeline supplies which are the largest component of European gas supply saw a large decline in the first half of 2020, decreasing by 6.8 Bcf a day year-on-year. The reduction in LNG flows into Europe in June is in large part a direct result of the turndown in global supply that I highlighted on the prior slide. The ability of global LNG buyers to exercise load management more effectively whether by lower contract dispatch or lower U.S. cargo nominations in combination with destination flexibility has given them important new tools to help manage the impact of adverse events. As a result, this has helped increase the flexibility and resilience of the global LNG trade. Finally in Europe, despite robust renewables output during the quarter as well as a decline in total electricity demand, the price competitiveness and elasticity of LNG have helped facilitate gas dispatch contributing to its resilience versus pipeline imports and other competing fuels. Now let's move to slide 10 to look at supply-demand dynamics in Asia. Total second quarter LNG imports into Asia remained flat throughout the quarter and only declined slightly year-on-year by less than one million tons as demand declines in Japan and South Korea were largely offset by a swift recovery in Chinese gas demand and double-digit LNG import growth rates in Taiwan and Thailand. Year-on-year LNG imports increased 20% in China, 14% in Taiwan and 10% in Thailand, Japan and South Korea LNG imports declined by 9% and 8% respectively. In the second quarter as these markets dealt with the impact of COVID on gas demand as well as demand fallout from a mild winter. However, looking forward, we see some positive factors for these two markets. Recently South Korea's Ministry of Trade Industry and Energy introduced additional policy measures that are expected to support gas demand. The government plans to lower retail natural gas prices for households and industries by an average of 13.1% beginning in July to reflect lower LNG import costs. In Japan, operational nuclear capacity fell to its lowest level in two years in June and is expected to further decline in the coming months, as capacity is expected to be taken off-line as a result of not meeting antiterrorism requirements. Only four out of nine restarted nuclear power units are expected to be operating by November of this year, which could anchor additional LNG demand. Through the first half of 2020, imports into Asia increased year-on-year with most of the support for demand coming from India, Taiwan, Thailand and China. In China gas demand in April and May, increased by 8% over 2019 levels compared to a growth rate below 2% in the first quarter. After a steep economic contraction in the Chinese economy in February, China's manufacturing PMI has been in expansion mode for four consecutive months since March. Also China's second quarter GDP was up 3.2% year-on-year, a rebound from a 6.8% drop in the first quarter. These factors all supported the increase in China's LNG demand which also gained market share by displacing pipe imports from Central Asia. Similarly in India, despite strict virus containment measures LNG use in the first half of 2020 increased 15% year-on-year to just over three Bcf a day while domestic gas production declined approximately 15% to an average of just over 2.5 Bcf a day in the January to May period. Overall, gas demand in that same period increased by 6% to about 5.5 Bcf a day. A similar pattern of prioritizing LNG imports over domestic gas production was seen in Thailand, where LNG imports also rose about 14% to just over 3 million tons in the first half of 2020, as a result of favorable economics and the flexible attributes of LNG. To conclude, COVID-19 has impacted industrial activity and have adverse effects on gas demand worldwide. This was particularly notable in key LNG markets in the second quarter. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw a slowdown in LNG production and decreased flows of excess cargoes to Europe. We believe this supply response is constructive in the near term and reduces the risk of reaching natural gas storage capacity at European storage facilities. While risks still remain in the near-term, as a result of ample storage inventories and reduced overall levels of economic activity, we see some positive factors for gas demand that are supportive of a near-term recovery in key LNG markets. We also reiterate that the long-term fundamentals remain attractive for LNG as a flexible and cleaner fuel. We see a supply demand gap of over 100 million tons by 2030 driven mainly by requirements from Asia's growing economies to feed new power generation and industrial demand displace coal and/or supplement declining domestic gas production. We continue to see interest from global players to enter the LNG import market from new players in existing importing countries to incumbents flying to expand into new markets, such as Africa and East Asia. We believe these markets require sustainable energy solutions including competitive LNG. As more than 150 million tons per annum of potential LNG capacity has been delayed or canceled and as high-risk projects continue to be sidelined, we Cheniere are well positioned and ready to address long-term supply shortages and capture demand opportunities for competitively priced LNG in the global market. Before turning the call over to Jack, I'd like to thank Michael for his partnership and tireless contributions to Cheniere and I wish him nothing but the best in the next chapter of his life. Likewise, I'd like to join Jack in congratulating Zach on becoming CFO and I will now turn the call over to him to review our financial results.\nZach Davis: Thanks, Anatol and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be here this morning. Over the last few years I've met many of you at investor events, conferences or in conjunction with our capital markets transaction. I look forward to getting out and meeting with more of the investment community, virtually for now, but hopefully in person at some point soon. Michael certainly leaves big shoes to fill but I'm beginning my role as CFO with the benefit of having had him not just as a boss but also as a mentor for nearly seven years as he hired me to work for him at Cheniere back in 2013. Under his leadership during that time we have raised over $50 billion in capital and reached FID on five trains, including the first greenfield LNG project in the Lower 48. Together, we developed Cheniere's capital allocation framework and balance sheet strategy including getting both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi to investment grade and I fully intend to continue executing on those long-term plans. Michael delivered on Cheniere's long promised financial transformation which has accompanied our transition from development to operations and Cheniere is now in a strong financial position with investment-grade-rated projects, access to cost-effective capital and with the financial flexibility to de-lever, grow, provide capital returns or all of the above. When Michael became CFO, we had no EBITDA and most of the numbers on our financial statements had parentheses around them. But this year we'll generate around $4 billion of EBITDA and we are nearing an inflection point on free cash flow. To say I'll miss working side-by-side with Michael every day is an understatement but with the benefit of his guidance and mentorship over the last seven years, I'm confident that I'm well equipped to lead a smooth transition and to continue -- Slide 12. For the second quarter we generated net income of $197 million, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.4 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $570 million. For the first half of the year, we generated net income of $572 million, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of over $2.4 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $830 million. For the first half of the year, we exported 727 TBtu of LNG from our liquefaction projects. We exported 274 TBtu of LNG or 78 cargoes, from our liquefaction projects during the second quarter. Total volumes exported were almost 40% or almost 182 TBtu, lower than exports in the first quarter of this year, primarily as a result of cargoes for which long-term customers elected not to take delivery. Additionally, we fulfilled some marketing sales utilizing third-party sourced cargoes, during the second quarter. For the second quarter we recognized an income, 305 TBtu of LNG produced at our liquefaction projects. And 34 TBtu of LNG sourced from third parties. Approximately 77% of the LNG volumes recognized, in income during the second quarter, was sold under either long-term SBAs or IPM agreements and the remaining 23% was sold by our marketing affiliate, either into the spot market or under short and medium-term contracts. Volumes sold under SBA or IPM agreements, decreased by approximately 113 TBtu, compared to the first quarter of 2020, driven primarily by cargoes for which long-term customers chose, not to take delivery of LNG, partially offset by the impact of reaching the data first commercial delivery or DFCD, under the long-term SBAs related to Corpus Christi Train 2 on May 1st. For the first half of the year, we recognized an income 764 TBtu of LNG produced, at our liquefaction projects and 48 TBtu of LNG sourced from third parties. As Jack mentioned, during the second quarter, our results were impacted by the timing of recognition of revenue related to cargo cancellations. When customers notify us that, they do not intend to lift cargoes flexibility, we provide them in their contracts. We recognize the related revenue, the fixed fees for those cargoes, at the time the notice is received. During the second quarter, we recognized revenue of over $700 million, related to, cancelled cargoes, including $458 million related to cargoes that would have been lifted during the third quarter, if customers had elected to lift the cargoes. Excluding the impact of cancelled cargoes, originally scheduled for the third quarter. And the $53 million impact of second quarter cargoes that were cancelled and recognized in the first quarter, our total revenues would have been $2 billion for the second quarter and approximately $4.65 billion, for the first half of 2020. The impact on consolidated adjusted EBITDA is similar to the impact on revenue. The impact of cargo cancellations on the recognition of fixed fees in our financial statements is one of timing, as we continue to record revenue and receive fixed fees under our long-term contracts overtime. But the forward nature of these cancellation notices means our results may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, depending upon the number of cancellations for each period. To be clear, the aggregate impact of this revenue recognition timing, consideration to our financials over time is zero. When the global LNG market returns to balance and our projects return to full utilization, the current impact will reverse. And we may have a quarter with lower EBITDA. Income from operations for the second quarter was $937 million, a decrease of over $400 million, compared to the first quarter. The decrease was primarily due to the non-recurrence of net mark-to-market gains from the changes in fair value of commodity derivatives, which occurred in the first quarter. And increased costs incurred in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the $458 million of revenue recognized for cargoes cancelled during the second quarter, that were scheduled to be lifted during the third quarter. Excluding the impact of out-of-period cancellations, total margins on LNG were materially consistent in the first quarter to the second quarter. As a slight decrease in volumes sold, was offset by an increase in margins per MMBtu of LNG, which was driven by a higher proportion of volumes sold under long-term contracts, during the second quarter. Net income attributable, to common stockholders for the second quarter was $197 million or $0.78 per share, basic and diluted a decrease of over $175 million from the first quarter of 2020. This decrease was driven primarily by the decrease in income from operations, and increased loss on modification or extinguishment of debt partially offset by decreased interest rate derivative loss and decreased income tax expense. Turn now to slide 13. During the second quarter, we completed multiple financial transactions to address the nearest term debt maturities, across our structure which Jack touched on earlier. In May, SPL issued $2 billion or 4.5% senior secured notes, due 2030, and used the proceeds from the offering to redeem its senior secured notes, which were set to mature, in February 2021. In June, we entered into a $2.62 billion three-year delayed draw term-loan credit agreement, which was upsized in July to $2.695 billion to address the 11% CCH Holdco II convertible notes, due 2025 and our 2021 convertible notes. In July, we drew on the term loan to redeem all of the 11% convertible notes outstanding, at CCH Holdco II with cash, at a price of $1,080 per $1,000 principal amount. And we repurchased $844 million of the 2021 convertible notes outstanding at the Cheniere level at individually negotiated prices from a small number of investors. We anticipate using the remaining capacity under the term loan facility, along with cash on hand, to repay and/or repurchase the remaining outstanding 2021 convertible notes. After these transactions, there's approximately $465 million principal outstanding for the 2021 convertible notes and undrawn capacity of $372 million on the CEI term loan. These convertible notes transactions address the significant portion of a near-term maturity, eliminated the most expensive debt within our structure, simplified our capital structure and prevented significant share dilution that would have occurred if these notes were converted to shares. These transactions reduce our expected run rate share count by over 40 million shares or about 15%, thereby increasing our expected run rate distributable cash flow per share. With the 2021 maturities effectively addressed, the next maturity in the Cheniere complex is not until 2022. In the meantime, we will continue to manage our maturity profile by opportunistically refinancing and/or paying down callable bank debt in our structure, subject to market conditions. We did not repurchase any shares under our share repurchase program during the second quarter, but clearly made significant progress on reducing run rate share count by redeeming convertible notes with cash. Though, we did so by increasing our consolidated leverage. With that said, we remain committed to the capital allocation priorities we released in mid-2019, including reducing our consolidated leverage to achieve investment-grade credit metrics across our structure. Including a consolidated debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the mid to high 4 times range. Refinancing the convertible notes with debt was not in our original run rate guidance and we are committed to using excess capital for debt reduction to achieve our leverage targets. This will be our capital allocation priority in the short and medium term. Last week, we announced the quarterly distribution for CQP, the payment of which will end the subordination period and trigger the conversion of the $135 million CQP subordinated units owned by Cheniere into common units of CQP on a one-for-one basis, further simplifying our capital structure. The distribution payment and subordinated unit conversion are expected to occur in mid-August. This week, Moody's investor service upgraded its rating of CCH's senior secured debt from Ba1 to Baa3. CCH is now rated investment-grade by all three rating agencies, a reflection of the strength of our project economics and a result of derisking the project over time, through increased equitization and completion progress. Before I turn the call over for Q&A, I'd like to review our 2020 guidance. As Jack mentioned we have a clear line of sight to achieving our financial goals for the year, despite continued market headwinds. And today we are reconfirming our 2020 full year guidance of consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $3.8 billion to $4.1 billion and distributable cash flow of $1 billion to $1.3 billion that we continue to track to the lower end of the EBITDA guidance range. As we have hedged market price exposure for almost all of our LNG production capacity this year, today a $1 move in market margin would result in approximately $35 million change in consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the year. With that sensitivity weighted to the upside, given today's market margins. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from Christine Cho with Barclays.\nChristine Cho: Good morning, all. First, I'd like to offer my congratulations to Zach. Look forward to working more with you. And also would like to send our wellies to Michael. If I could maybe start -- since Q2 was a pretty difficult environment. But curious if you could give us an idea of what sort of opportunities you saw for CMI with third-party cargo. I guess I was a bit surprised at the number of third-party carloads, but there were also reports during the quarter that you issued a tender seeking LNG supply. So was that just an opportunity to take down production at your facility by really cheap cargoes at a price lower than what you could have supplied to customers for? And should we think that you lost in lower prices for later this year as well?\nAnatol Feygin: Good morning, Christine, it's Anatol. Thanks for the questions. I would say, in general, we are a fairly sizable player in the market and have demonstrated over the last four years a lot of commercial flexibility and ability to respond to market conditions and roll with these punches. As you know, we were quite substantially hedged for this year and that as markets all over the world became volatile and correlated presented a number of opportunities to us. You see that in the numbers of third-party sourced cargoes in the second quarter and allowed us to genuinely optimize the positions that we had on intra-quarter. I won't comment on specific tools and outcomes of attempting to leverage those tools, but suffice it to say that there were a number of bites at the apple that market's presented as they rebalanced throughout this period.\nJack Fusco: And I'll say Christine, this is Jack. That we have tested all aspects of our business model including our flexibility and reliability of the way these trains have been designed and/or operated. So we -- the supply response that you saw from the U.S. LNG industry to low prices is what we were designed to handle. And that's what we did. And we took advantage of some opportunities of other facilities that maybe couldn't respond so quickly and we were able to buy significantly cheaper LNG from them and have it delivered to meet our CMI requirements.\nChristine Cho: And assuming that market is stable right now we shouldn't assume that like this repeats in the future or like for the remainder of the year? Is that correct?\nJack Fusco: Yes. As Anatol highlighted, we're seeing a strong recovery in LNG demand growth especially in Asia. And I'd say we are cautiously optimistic that the economies around the world will come back. We'll continue to see the growth. Hopefully, we get some cooler weather in this winter and we'll see spreads continue to increase.\nChristine Cho: Okay. So I guess on that note as we look at the Asia demand, how are you guys thinking about the trajectory of Asia LNG imports specifically in China relative to overall gas demand in the region? And what are the puts and takes to consider for U.S. LNG whether it's trade agreements I don't know like what the storage position look like in China and/or commitments that China may have with non-U.S. LNG facilities?\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Thanks, Christine. From a fundamental standpoint the medium- and long-term fundamentals through this period, we think have actually improved for the business. And as we've said for years now, China is one of the key drivers of that. It is committed to natural gas. It is showing that commitment clearly as GDP rebounded there, gas demand growth rebounded even stronger. We're seeing that across multiple economies as Jack mentioned. And as we've discussed in the past, we are quite sanguine about opportunities for gas into Europe as solid fuel power is retired there. China will continue to be a very important factor for us. As you've seen we've sent cargoes over half a dozen cargoes now to China as things there start to normalize both in terms of demand in terms of tariffs and other opportunities present themselves. Clearly, there is a headwind in terms of the geopolitical backdrop that we're operating in. But commercially there's a massive tailwind. And this is the flexibility the reliability that we've demonstrated the relationships we've built on the commercial side all position Cheniere quite well to capture substantial share of that market when the stars align. So we continue to be very optimistic. And this 20% growth we saw in Q2 is just the start we think of those tailwinds.\nJack Fusco: And Christine I'll add our Beijing office is open. They've been extremely busy, back at work back entertaining different clients and customers. And I'm very pleased with how the relationship is forming with our Chinese counterparts.\nChristine Cho: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning. \nJack Fusco: Good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: I know that you guys aren't going to comment on individual cancellations from customers not your policy to do that. But I was just wondering I guess at a high level, if you could discuss with us any trends and cancellations overall. It seems like going into the winter there will be less. And maybe another way of asking this I guess just how do you see the market tightening over time, or how long do you see the market right now?\nJack Fusco: So first Jeremy just on cancellation of cargo. So we've given a lot of disclosures in this queue. And there's just some basic rules that you could back calculate number of cargoes. And I'll ask Zach just to kind of walk through that part of it for you first.\nA \u2013 Zach Davis: Sure. So I think we mentioned, Jeremy. But I think we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're reducing production from the facilities from Q1 to Q2 by about 180 TBtu. Just define that by 3.5 TBtu. So that's about 50 cargoes. And then if you look at the numbers that we were talking about. Pretty much each cargoes up let's say on average very simple, $10 or so.\nJeremy Tonet: $10 million.\nZach Davis: $10 million, yes. So when you account for that in Q2 not including what occurred in Q3 there was about $300 million of count cancellation, $250 million that stayed in the quarter and $50 million that were brought forward into Q1. That's about 30 long-term cargoes or so. So you can kind of break out what was CMI and what was the long-term customers.\nJack Fusco: So -- and while we're not going to comment on individual customers and their cancellations. I would also add in there Jeremy that you had the pandemic -- you had a warm winter first and you had the pandemic and then you follow that up with the shoulder months and things looked a little bleak. I mean as I said I'm cautiously optimistic that we're beyond that. And we're starting to ramp up. I'll turn it over to Anatol if he has anything to add.\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. I just -- as we've commented and highlighted in these slides and it does look to us that the lows are in. You've seen a very dramatic rebound in global prices. Obviously there is a transmission mechanism from the U.S. to the rest of the world now which is underutilized. And so that is one of the factors that's contributing to a rally in NYMEX as well which of course is -- from a spread standpoint dampening that value. But we do see a fairly robust demand response. You're seeing that in GDP numbers. You're seeing that in the transportation numbers across various economies. You're seeing that in power dispatch, and in terms of the magnitude of this supply response adding up U.S. and the rest of the world kind of in the mid-single digits in terms of the global LNG market. And three out of the last four years the LNG market has grown by double digits. So a way to look at it is, what's been happening now is about half a year's worth of market growth. And the one thing that we know for a fact is what the supply additions could max out at right? You know as well as we do, what projects are scheduled to come online over the next 4 five years. So to not be sanguine on the market rebalancing, you have to be fairly pessimistic about global gas demand. And there's -- there are no signs of that that we see today. So rebalancing is a question of to us of quarters not years. And if we get a little bit of a weather tailwind as opposed to the headwinds we've had over the last number of years that will be that much sooner.\nJeremy Tonet: That's very helpful. Thank you. And just want to come back with the second question on capital allocation. And I guess maybe the long rage timing to hit investment-grade or to institute a dividend I think the last June, June last year you talked about a 3 to 5 year range and kind of being in a position to hit that. Obviously as you said taking out the convertibles was not in that plan. It's nicely accretive. I assume that pushes it back a little bit here. But just wondering if you could update us on your thoughts on that time line?\nZach Davis: Hey Jeremy, it's Zach again. I'd say though we did raise debt for -- and instead of equitizing those converts and clearly added to the amount of debt paydown that will eventually need to do to get to IG. Really doesn't push out our targets of early to mid-2020s at this point. And now our ultimate goal is getting to let's say mid 4x range on a debt-to-EBITDA basis on a consolidated balance sheet. We think we should be in a good position for IG as soon as we cross over 5x and show that commitment to managing the balance sheet. And we always said the debt paydown won't really start in earnest until the back half of the 5-year plan. So once CCL Train 3, SPL Train 6 come online and the excess cash flow really ramps up, you'll see us really making a dent in it. And just to put in perspective with our numbers, over the next five years or so we're going to have approximately $10 billion of available cash. And once Train 6 comes online in 2022, we have almost $3 billion a year of distributable cash flow. So we feel pretty good that we have line of sight with our cash flow to achieve not only IG during that period of time, but have excess cash flow on top of that for future capital returns and even push forward with Stage three once it's commercialized.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nAnya Shelekhin: This is Anya. I'm filling for Julien here. So first question on -- could you talk about cargo cancellations on just a second on that how do you expect cancellation revenues? And then there is subsequent reversal to play into where you fall within 2020 guidance range? And then also anything you can add on that even preliminarily on impact on 2021, just based on your assessment of the market?\nZach Davis: Let me make sure I understand the first part of that question was on cargo cancellations and how we account for them?\nAnya Shelekhin: No. The question is more on cargo cancellations and what has been the impact of those cancellation revenues. And then the reversal of those revenues as cargo cancellations decline. Just thoughts on your -- just assessment of the market overall and how would that impact EBITDA? So trajectory of carrier cancellations moving better with that\u2026\nZach Davis: Clearly, we brought in revenue - this is Zach. We brought in revenue from Q3 into Q2 of $450 million that would have normally been in Q3. That's really because they have to give us around two months notice if they're canceling. And if they give us notice that they're canceling, our obligations are complete so we can recognize the revenue. What you could see is year-to-date, our EBITDA is more -- well more than half of our guidance range. So we're accounting for this meaning that clearly in Q3 and then Q4 it should reverse to an extent because those revenues were brought forward. And based on just the curves today and how we see it, we do think our customers would be lifting. That's economic to be lifting through the winter. So you will see the reversal in Q3 or Q4.\nAnya Shelekhin: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then also just given more limited growth prospects with the markets of our own. Is there anything you can add on how much you can take out on the cost side? How should we think about run rate O&M just in a no-growth scenario? And then any other de-bottlenecking opportunities that you could add?\nJack Fusco: I'll start with the de-bottlenecking. So we've taken this opportunity with the customers canceling cargoes to move some maintenance forward. So we're doing a significant amount of work on the trains with our own crews. Because of COVID, we want to minimize a number of outside contract crews at our facilities, but they're doing a great job working around the clock in some cases. And we feel very good about our ability to optimize the output of those trains. In November when we give guidance for 2021 it's my expectation that we'll have a revision to our production guidance also as well as a run rate guidance that Zach had mentioned. Zach do you have anything you want to add?\nZach Davis: Sure. I mean, we're quite transparent on the run rate numbers. And when we go through the budget process, which we're literally kicking off now in preparation to make that guidance in the next quarter. We assume the 9-train program. And only once FID is made on the next project. Do we add those costs or those revenues to the forecast. So that's pretty transparent. But if you just look at this year and the quantum of cancellations that we've had and the fact that we've been able to reaffirm guidance that's all thanks to the great work that our operations team has done to offset a large portion of that lifting margin that we'd normally make on those liftings.\nAnya Shelekhin: Great. Thank you. \nZach Davis: Thank you. \nOperator: We'll now hear from Michael Webber with Webber Research & Advisory.\nMichael Webber: Good morning, guys. How are you?\nJack Fusco: Good morning, Michael.\nMichael Webber: I will start by wishing Michael well. And welcoming Zach. Just two questions for you. First on the impact of COVID, but specifically with related to construction. You guys kind of surprisingly pull-forward the time frame for Train 6 to the second half 2022. So in a market where we're talking about shared schedule relief and force majeure you guys are pulling forward the construction time line for a project. It seems to -- seems to be a bit counterintuitive or kind of run contrary to maybe what we're seeing elsewhere. So I guess that question is kind of twofold. Is that -- do you expect maybe some of the competing projects around you in the U.S. to all be able to stay on pace and hit the market as planned, or is your data point more of an outlier? And then two what's the primary driver from that? Is that just slack in the schedule? Is it a function of maybe union versus non-union labor? It's just -- it's an interesting data point in the middle of the pandemic to be pulling something forward.\nJack Fusco: So first \u2013 Michael, thanks. So I want to give a shout out to Bechtel in the Cheniere E&C team because we moved swiftly on isolating crews and putting in well beyond what the CDC was recommending different policies and procedures to ensure that there wouldn't be a big impact on the engineering and construction effort. And that if there was an impact it wouldn't impact our operating forces at our facilities. So it has worked extremely well. And Bechtel has done a good job at managing their COVID cases that they have had and made sure that they didn't run rampant throughout the construction effort. We had some good weather that allowed Bechtel on the E&C -- Cheniere and E&C team to make up a lot of lost ground. And up until recently now where we've had some tropical storms a little bit of hurricane activity. They were able to significantly progress both Corpus Christi Train 3 and Sabine Pass Train 6. So I'm very, very pleased with what they're able to do. I think if you're asking me my view on the rest of the LNG market as Anatol mentioned in his prepared remarks, we've seen a significant number of our competitors either delay or cancel their liquefaction plans. And it's put us on much stronger footing in the marketplace than we were pre COVID. And I'll look at Anatol.\nAnatol Feygin: Yeah. No. As Jack said, we see medium to long-term demand at/or above pre-COVID levels and we see the competitive landscape as substantially beneficial to us over this period as Jack mentioned. And we mentioned in the prepared remarks. And the construction and execution to your question is just one of those. And I would say more from a reputational benefit commercially right? There isn't -- I don't think there's a counterparty that we deal with that it does not appreciate our ability to bring these trains on early under budget and operate them reliably and flexibly.\nMichael Webber: Got you. Okay, that's helpful. And then second this is probably a question for Anatol and at the risk of maybe being a bit too far ahead in front of something. One of the themes that hasn't slowed down at all during the pandemic has been the decarbonization of Europe. And we've seen a number of countries that are -- with national champions that make up your customer base come out and talk about hydrogen and natural gas blending targets at 10% to 15% by 2030. So taking a sizable chunk out of the future European natural gas market. So I'm just curious how do you think about that standing here today? And I know it's been relatively recent and it's pretty far out in the front. But I'm just curious what impact you think that has on the approach from European buyers? And then two, is there a possibility of turning them into an opportunity for Cheniere in terms of investing downstream maybe to offer more integrated solutions for those customer bases considering they're simply blending other molecules with your natural gas?\nJack Fusco: Michael, if it's all right with you. I'm going to start with the second part of that and then I'll hand it over to Anatol for the first part of it. So as you know, we're always looking for strategic opportunities, and especially where we believe we have a competitive advantage. And we can leverage our scale in our platform. And it's not lost on me that we move four hydrogen atoms for every carbon atom that we sell that we're a leader in developing, constructing, operating and owning cryogenic infrastructure here in America. So in addition, we believe that LNG has a major role to play in this whole global decarbonization effort across the globe. And that hydrogen may present an opportunity to complement those environmental benefits, as well as leverage our own core competencies in terms of market access, infrastructure development, operations, construction as Anatol mentioned. So you would expect that I am extremely excited about our prospects and about evaluating our opportunities to participate in the hydrogen market. And I don't know Anatol if you\u2026\nAnatol Feygin: Yeah. I'll just add the plug for the teams, the broad team's great efforts in our inaugural CSR report. I think to be perfectly honest before we embarked on this process now probably a good two years ago, we thought we were a part of the solution but we weren't 100% sure. And we didn't have the science and the analysis to back that up. Now we're that much more confident. And you'll see us participating a lot more and taking control of that narrative, which we needed to check a lot of boxes internally and verify that that was the case. So we are now that much more confident that we are part of the solution and you've seen this from a number of players in the industry whether that's the European \u2013 majors, the European, load serving utilities even the -- some of the trading houses are continuing to push LNG and gas as part of the long-term solution to climate issues and we are confident that Cheniere will be at the forefront of that.\nMichael Webber: Okay. Thanks for the time guys.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Shneur Gershuni with UBS.\nShneur Gershuni: Hi, good morning everyone. A lot of my questions macro-wise have been asked and answered. What I did want to focus on was actually the refinancing that you did. I think it's interesting and I'm not sure -- I want to make sure I understand it correctly. Basically what you've done is you've effectively lowered your coupon rate from 11% to the 3% zone. So that's kind of an $80 million savings in terms of savings per year. But it also negates the conversion of debt into 40 million shares. And so is it fair to say that you've done a de facto backdoor buyback of shares at the end of the day and then you can use excess cash flow between now and then when it would have converted towards debt paydown? Is that the right way to think about it that you're offsetting upcoming dilution and lowering your coupon payment?\nZach Davis: Yeah. I think you already wrote your research report. But I'll just summarize everything that we've accomplished so far this year just to help everybody appreciate what we've really done. So I'll start off by reiterating what was said in the prepared remarks that our commitment to get to EIG across the entire complex, but the early to mid-2020s has not wavered. However, we did mention going into this year that it would be a jump ball between debt paydown and buybacks. And if we had to defer debt pay down a little bit to be opportunistic with the stock. That's what we do. And that's exactly what you saw us do in the first half of this year. So in Q1 not only did we buy back over $150 million of shares. We bought back $300 million of the EIG notes that were -- that we gave guidance that we're going to convert. And with that we got that option for six months to take out the rest. So we immediately went to work on this term loan knowing that that could be incredibly attractive to us in terms of the cost, the runway, the callability to not only take out EIG but RRJ at the same time and just be able to say we have no maturities across the complex now till 2022. So yes, we reduced share count on a run rate basis. I mean, we came out with that run rate guidance in 2019. So we'll update it probably after budget at the November earnings call. But that's well over 40 million shares that we've saved in that run rate guidance. So now with where we stand we're going to focus on that debt paydown with the incremental leverage that we just raised. So you'll see us prioritizing debt pay down for the next few quarters as you would expect. And make a dent on this incremental leverage and ensure that we're still on that path to EIG by the mid -- early to mid-2020. And then I'll just note again that capital allocation gets a lot more impactful, once Train 3 comes online. Because at that point, we'll finally hit that inflection point that I mentioned earlier where we go from free cash flow negative to free cash flow positive. Like we've all been waiting for. So the numbers start to get a lot more meaningful then. And so we should be on a path to EIG. But at the same time be able to consider capital returns in 2021 again. And be ready for stage three once it's commercialized.\nShneur Gershuni: Okay. That makes sense. So this was sort of a clever way to lower your coupon payment and basically offset a big dilution that was coming and position you to basically pay down debt with all the excess cash. That makes perfect sense. [Technical Difficulty] I recognize there was a reluctance to update guidance. And if I understood all the comments earlier, it's effectively a pull forward of third quarter revenues into second quarter revenue -- into second quarter. Given Anatol's comments about things starting to improve and so forth, do you see a scenario where you can exceed your guidance or be on the upper end for this year, or is it kind of -- you kind of feel pretty good with where you're seeing things right now as to how you've reaffirmed your guidance for this year?\nJack Fusco: Well on this call we're reconfirming our guidance for the year. And which as you know we gave that guidance back in November of 2019 which was pre-COVID. And to me that would be a massive success. And I'd be popping a lot of champagne at the end of this year. It has been extremely stressful and a tough year.\nShneur Gershuni: Fair enough. Appreciate the color today.\nOperator: The next question will come from Sean Morgan with Evercore.\nSean Morgan: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So I appreciate you did a lot to sort of shift this dilution by repaying these notes, but there's still -- I think in 2045, there's $625 million of convertibles that I think you can start redeeming as of March 2020. So I'm wondering if maybe there's a longer time frame that you have to sort of deal with those or what's the thought as to why those are being treated differently than the ones you've kind of more aggressively than paying down to avoid that dilution?\nZach Davis: Yes. This is Zach. Thanks for the question Sean. Those are unsecured notes at CEI due in 2045 with a rate around 4%. And what we just focused on was something due within a year and the most expensive debt on the whole balance sheet of 11%. So it's like another world those converts. So they're really not the priority for quite some time. So they're going to sit there. I think the conversion price is in the 140s. And when we get closer to that we can talk. But in the meantime we're going to focus on paying down debt in the bank deals. Those are totally callable and they're both secured at CEI and BCH. And that's the type of debt that we want to get rid of first.\nSean Morgan: Okay. And then maybe just -- maybe this is a question for Anatol. But is there any evidence that customers that have been canceling the long-term cargoes have been kind of going back into the spot market and buying it sort of at a spot at a discount rate. And is that arm open? Is that something you're seeing?\nAnatol Feygin: Well again as we mentioned earlier, the market has been quite volatile. This is an unprecedented time in terms of the flexibility that this U.S. Cheniere model has brought into the market. One of the things that you saw publicly was a buyer cancel and prepay some cargoes to an entity that happens to be a foundation customer of ours. So there are lots of tools being deployed by the market at the margin to properly position themselves. And again this option to cancel the cargoes, not pay the commodity charge is a great flexible tool that obviously our customers have taken advantage of as have we ourselves. So again, at the margin, you see lots of activity to optimize portfolios. And that's what our business model allows the customers to do.\nSean Morgan: Okay. Yeah. And I guess the lower utilization some of those are kind of going unfilled. But that's interesting. Thanks a lot. I\u2019m going to turn it over.\nJack Fusco: Thanks, Sean.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from James Carreker with U.S. Capital Advisors.\nJames Carreker: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick accounting question. I understood you're bringing forward the revenue recognition for canceled cargoes. When do you actually receive the cash for that?\nZach Davis: So when we receive the cash is the normal time period. So, even, if they canceled now or let's say in Q2 for Q3 delivery the actual cash will come in Q3.\nJames Carreker: So your cash from operations for Q2 may be significantly lower than the adjusted EBITDA but then that reverses next quarter as well?\nAnatol Feygin: Yeah. It all comes together over a few months. Got you. And I was wondering if I could get a quick update on how you see remaining capital spend for both Train 3 and Train 6?\nZach Davis: Sure. So for Train 6, I think, we said last quarter we had $1.4 billion left of unlevered costs before contingency. And that's down to $1.1 billion at this point. And then, in terms of Train 3, it was around $600 million or so. Let's just say, we're under $600 million at this point with \u2013 for Corpus before contingency and most of that will be spent this year with us being really deep in commissioning by early next year.\nJames Carreker: Got it. And then if I could fit one more quick one in. I guess, how should we think about capital spend kind of post train construction with nine trains assuming there'll be some de-bottlenecking projects kind of ongoing, but what order of magnitude kind of \u2013 what do you expect that number to be once you complete the build out?\nZach Davis: Sure. In 2019, when we gave that investor update we said Cheniere share of these de-bottlenecking projects and some development costs would be around $700 million. I'd say that number is a few hundred \u2013 a couple or a few hundred million dollars less at this point just because we did spend some of that money to get to the higher ranges of our production at both sites. But that's over a five-year period. So it's not a huge amount of money when we're talking about over $10 billion of available cash.\nJames Carreker: Okay. Thank you. That's all I had.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Ben Nolan with Stifel.\nBen Nolan: Yeah. Hey, thanks, guys. So I have a couple of commercial questions. The first is maybe could you just talk through \u2013 we've heard a lot of noise about maybe a little bit of an improvement in the appetite for incremental long-term contracts. And I was curious if you might be able to frame whether there's any change in the dynamics there. People looking for more flexibility or shorter terms or sort of anything to kind of break the ice in terms of incremental new business.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Ben. Yeah, this is Anatol. I'll take that. It's \u2013 I guess the answer is all of the above. We've demonstrated commercial flexibility over the last 2.5, three years, as contrasted with our original very innovative, but very stat 115% plus x-type transactions. We're going to continue to do that. That includes lots of different levers tenor is one of them. How we structure those offtake agreements and the flexibility we provide to them is another. These are, as you know, multibillion-dollar transactions. They're not consummated over the phone. They do require a lot of time and effort especially to get it over the proverbial finish line. And the entire world has been working from home. So, we've continued to be engaged and make progress on a number of fronts, but to get them across the finish line requires a market that has some level of normalcy both in terms of pricing as well as in terms of being able to finalize negotiations. So, we're very well-positioned. We're very excited, as you can tell from these remarks and the charts that we put in front of you lots of green shoots and good engagement. But, to get it over the finish line, the precise timing is really anybody's guess.\nBen Nolan: Okay. I appreciate that. And then sort of similar, but in a different direction over the last, I don't know, quarters to really few maybe a month, the U.S. is approved LNG by rail. You have a smaller downstream developer looking to do big ISO container development. Is there is it possible or has there been any thinking about maybe adding a little infrastructure to your facilities to be able to maybe facilitate or service maybe some of those smaller well small-scale kind of projects and development and that so thing?\nJack Fusco: Ben, I'll say, we spent a lot of time looking at bunkering and how we can be a service to the bunkering market. I am not a big believer of shipping LNG on rail myself, but it doesn't mean there may not be an opportunity for somebody. But, our quantity of LNG that we produce and ship every day is massive. So that is a very small -- would be a very small stream for us or business line for us.\nBen Nolan: All right, I appreciate that. I was just curious, if it was an area that you were looking to -- but appreciate. Thank you, guys.\nJack Fusco: This makes a lot. And I want to thank everybody for their support over this quarter. And I hope everyone stays safe and healthy.\nOperator: That will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Anatol Feygin",
            "content": "Thanks Jack and good morning everyone. Please turn to slide 8. I'll start by reviewing the trends we observed throughout the first half of 2020, then highlight the factors that we think will continue to impact the global LNG supply and demand dynamics going forward. Many of these factors started to become apparent late in the second quarter. And we believe they bring into focus two main themes, the flexibility of the global LNG supply system and the resilience of LNG as a fuel choice. Global LNG supplies increased 6% year-on-year in the first half of 2020, reaching 188 million tons. The U.S. contributed most of this LNG production growth with exports rising 64% year-on-year to approximately 26 million tons. However, supply growth for the first half of this year was at a lower rate than the significant growth in LNG supply that began several years ago, as the current cycle of supply additions started to slow and as global liquefaction supply adjusted output downwards to adapt to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on gas demand. Most measures introduced to contain the coronavirus including city lockdowns and restrictions on travel impacted gas demand and LNG markets in the second quarter. With weak LNG demand in Asia, more global production was pushed into Europe, resulting in record seasonal gas inventory levels and exerting downward pressure on spot gas prices in Europe and Asia. During the second quarter, TTF averaged $1.76 per MMBtu, approximately 60% lower than the comparable 2019 period, while JKM averaged $2.58 in MMBtu during the second quarter, 50% lower year-on-year. By late May, the combination of supply side flexibility demonstrated by U.S. and global operations with a gradual recovery in LNG demand in India China and the Middle East had reduced the flow of surplus LNG cargoes to Europe. Global LNG supply trended down for the third consecutive month in June, dropping slightly below the levels of the second quarter of 2019. The global supply utilization decreased to 82% on average in the second quarter this year versus 93% in the first quarter. As a result, LNG supply growth turned negative in the second quarter, declining by about one million tons ending a six quarter run of supply additions which averaged close to 10 million tons each quarter. While it's too early to call this a bullish market, we believe the recent slowdown in production is constructive in the near term and reduces the risk of reaching maximum natural gas storage levels too early in the year at European storage facilities. Now turn to slide 9, where I will address the European market in some more detail. The four residual LNG cargoes to Europe continued through a significant portion of the second quarter despite gas consumption declines, resulting from measures put in place to fight the spread of COVID-19. LNG imports into Europe grew 6.7 million tons or about 15% year-on-year during the first half of 2020. Consumption data however suggests that gas demand in Europe declined nearly 8% or 4.5 Bcf a day during this period due to a mix of weather and COVID 19 impact. Sharp declines in LNG imports into Europe began in June and have continued into July. These decreases have played an important role in helping ease the European storage surplus from 15 BCM or over 0.5 trillion cubic feet in May to six bcm or just over 200 Bcf at present. LNG is not the only lever that impacts over supply risk in the current gas market environment in Europe. As you might expect, pipeline supplies which are the largest component of European gas supply saw a large decline in the first half of 2020, decreasing by 6.8 Bcf a day year-on-year. The reduction in LNG flows into Europe in June is in large part a direct result of the turndown in global supply that I highlighted on the prior slide. The ability of global LNG buyers to exercise load management more effectively whether by lower contract dispatch or lower U.S. cargo nominations in combination with destination flexibility has given them important new tools to help manage the impact of adverse events. As a result, this has helped increase the flexibility and resilience of the global LNG trade. Finally in Europe, despite robust renewables output during the quarter as well as a decline in total electricity demand, the price competitiveness and elasticity of LNG have helped facilitate gas dispatch contributing to its resilience versus pipeline imports and other competing fuels. Now let's move to slide 10 to look at supply-demand dynamics in Asia. Total second quarter LNG imports into Asia remained flat throughout the quarter and only declined slightly year-on-year by less than one million tons as demand declines in Japan and South Korea were largely offset by a swift recovery in Chinese gas demand and double-digit LNG import growth rates in Taiwan and Thailand. Year-on-year LNG imports increased 20% in China, 14% in Taiwan and 10% in Thailand, Japan and South Korea LNG imports declined by 9% and 8% respectively. In the second quarter as these markets dealt with the impact of COVID on gas demand as well as demand fallout from a mild winter. However, looking forward, we see some positive factors for these two markets. Recently South Korea's Ministry of Trade Industry and Energy introduced additional policy measures that are expected to support gas demand. The government plans to lower retail natural gas prices for households and industries by an average of 13.1% beginning in July to reflect lower LNG import costs. In Japan, operational nuclear capacity fell to its lowest level in two years in June and is expected to further decline in the coming months, as capacity is expected to be taken off-line as a result of not meeting antiterrorism requirements. Only four out of nine restarted nuclear power units are expected to be operating by November of this year, which could anchor additional LNG demand. Through the first half of 2020, imports into Asia increased year-on-year with most of the support for demand coming from India, Taiwan, Thailand and China. In China gas demand in April and May, increased by 8% over 2019 levels compared to a growth rate below 2% in the first quarter. After a steep economic contraction in the Chinese economy in February, China's manufacturing PMI has been in expansion mode for four consecutive months since March. Also China's second quarter GDP was up 3.2% year-on-year, a rebound from a 6.8% drop in the first quarter. These factors all supported the increase in China's LNG demand which also gained market share by displacing pipe imports from Central Asia. Similarly in India, despite strict virus containment measures LNG use in the first half of 2020 increased 15% year-on-year to just over three Bcf a day while domestic gas production declined approximately 15% to an average of just over 2.5 Bcf a day in the January to May period. Overall, gas demand in that same period increased by 6% to about 5.5 Bcf a day. A similar pattern of prioritizing LNG imports over domestic gas production was seen in Thailand, where LNG imports also rose about 14% to just over 3 million tons in the first half of 2020, as a result of favorable economics and the flexible attributes of LNG. To conclude, COVID-19 has impacted industrial activity and have adverse effects on gas demand worldwide. This was particularly notable in key LNG markets in the second quarter. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw a slowdown in LNG production and decreased flows of excess cargoes to Europe. We believe this supply response is constructive in the near term and reduces the risk of reaching natural gas storage capacity at European storage facilities. While risks still remain in the near-term, as a result of ample storage inventories and reduced overall levels of economic activity, we see some positive factors for gas demand that are supportive of a near-term recovery in key LNG markets. We also reiterate that the long-term fundamentals remain attractive for LNG as a flexible and cleaner fuel. We see a supply demand gap of over 100 million tons by 2030 driven mainly by requirements from Asia's growing economies to feed new power generation and industrial demand displace coal and/or supplement declining domestic gas production. We continue to see interest from global players to enter the LNG import market from new players in existing importing countries to incumbents flying to expand into new markets, such as Africa and East Asia. We believe these markets require sustainable energy solutions including competitive LNG. As more than 150 million tons per annum of potential LNG capacity has been delayed or canceled and as high-risk projects continue to be sidelined, we Cheniere are well positioned and ready to address long-term supply shortages and capture demand opportunities for competitively priced LNG in the global market. Before turning the call over to Jack, I'd like to thank Michael for his partnership and tireless contributions to Cheniere and I wish him nothing but the best in the next chapter of his life. Likewise, I'd like to join Jack in congratulating Zach on becoming CFO and I will now turn the call over to him to review our financial results. Good morning, Christine, it's Anatol. Thanks for the questions. I would say, in general, we are a fairly sizable player in the market and have demonstrated over the last four years a lot of commercial flexibility and ability to respond to market conditions and roll with these punches. As you know, we were quite substantially hedged for this year and that as markets all over the world became volatile and correlated presented a number of opportunities to us. You see that in the numbers of third-party sourced cargoes in the second quarter and allowed us to genuinely optimize the positions that we had on intra-quarter. I won't comment on specific tools and outcomes of attempting to leverage those tools, but suffice it to say that there were a number of bites at the apple that market's presented as they rebalanced throughout this period. Yes. Thanks, Christine. From a fundamental standpoint the medium- and long-term fundamentals through this period, we think have actually improved for the business. And as we've said for years now, China is one of the key drivers of that. It is committed to natural gas. It is showing that commitment clearly as GDP rebounded there, gas demand growth rebounded even stronger. We're seeing that across multiple economies as Jack mentioned. And as we've discussed in the past, we are quite sanguine about opportunities for gas into Europe as solid fuel power is retired there. China will continue to be a very important factor for us. As you've seen we've sent cargoes over half a dozen cargoes now to China as things there start to normalize both in terms of demand in terms of tariffs and other opportunities present themselves. Clearly, there is a headwind in terms of the geopolitical backdrop that we're operating in. But commercially there's a massive tailwind. And this is the flexibility the reliability that we've demonstrated the relationships we've built on the commercial side all position Cheniere quite well to capture substantial share of that market when the stars align. So we continue to be very optimistic. And this 20% growth we saw in Q2 is just the start we think of those tailwinds. Yes. I just -- as we've commented and highlighted in these slides and it does look to us that the lows are in. You've seen a very dramatic rebound in global prices. Obviously there is a transmission mechanism from the U.S. to the rest of the world now which is underutilized. And so that is one of the factors that's contributing to a rally in NYMEX as well which of course is -- from a spread standpoint dampening that value. But we do see a fairly robust demand response. You're seeing that in GDP numbers. You're seeing that in the transportation numbers across various economies. You're seeing that in power dispatch, and in terms of the magnitude of this supply response adding up U.S. and the rest of the world kind of in the mid-single digits in terms of the global LNG market. And three out of the last four years the LNG market has grown by double digits. So a way to look at it is, what's been happening now is about half a year's worth of market growth. And the one thing that we know for a fact is what the supply additions could max out at right? You know as well as we do, what projects are scheduled to come online over the next 4 five years. So to not be sanguine on the market rebalancing, you have to be fairly pessimistic about global gas demand. And there's -- there are no signs of that that we see today. So rebalancing is a question of to us of quarters not years. And if we get a little bit of a weather tailwind as opposed to the headwinds we've had over the last number of years that will be that much sooner. Yeah. No. As Jack said, we see medium to long-term demand at/or above pre-COVID levels and we see the competitive landscape as substantially beneficial to us over this period as Jack mentioned. And we mentioned in the prepared remarks. And the construction and execution to your question is just one of those. And I would say more from a reputational benefit commercially right? There isn't -- I don't think there's a counterparty that we deal with that it does not appreciate our ability to bring these trains on early under budget and operate them reliably and flexibly. Yeah. I'll just add the plug for the teams, the broad team's great efforts in our inaugural CSR report. I think to be perfectly honest before we embarked on this process now probably a good two years ago, we thought we were a part of the solution but we weren't 100% sure. And we didn't have the science and the analysis to back that up. Now we're that much more confident. And you'll see us participating a lot more and taking control of that narrative, which we needed to check a lot of boxes internally and verify that that was the case. So we are now that much more confident that we are part of the solution and you've seen this from a number of players in the industry whether that's the European \u2013 majors, the European, load serving utilities even the -- some of the trading houses are continuing to push LNG and gas as part of the long-term solution to climate issues and we are confident that Cheniere will be at the forefront of that. Well again as we mentioned earlier, the market has been quite volatile. This is an unprecedented time in terms of the flexibility that this U.S. Cheniere model has brought into the market. One of the things that you saw publicly was a buyer cancel and prepay some cargoes to an entity that happens to be a foundation customer of ours. So there are lots of tools being deployed by the market at the margin to properly position themselves. And again this option to cancel the cargoes, not pay the commodity charge is a great flexible tool that obviously our customers have taken advantage of as have we ourselves. So again, at the margin, you see lots of activity to optimize portfolios. And that's what our business model allows the customers to do. Yeah. It all comes together over a few months. Got you. And I was wondering if I could get a quick update on how you see remaining capital spend for both Train 3 and Train 6? Thanks, Ben. Yeah, this is Anatol. I'll take that. It's \u2013 I guess the answer is all of the above. We've demonstrated commercial flexibility over the last 2.5, three years, as contrasted with our original very innovative, but very stat 115% plus x-type transactions. We're going to continue to do that. That includes lots of different levers tenor is one of them. How we structure those offtake agreements and the flexibility we provide to them is another.

            "name": "Jack Fusco",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our results from the second quarter of 2020. We had an outstanding quarter, especially considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and energy markets, on how people live and work and how companies worldwide have had to adapt through everyday operations. The current environment has presented challenges, but the resiliency of our customer-oriented business and the professionalism and resolute focus of the Cheniere workforce continues to deliver outcomes, which benefit all of our stakeholders. The second quarter was highlighted by a number of significant achievements across multiple phases of our business and our visibility on achieving our 2020 financial targets remain steadfast. Before I get started though, I'm sure you noticed this morning's personnel announcement of the departure of Michael Wortley, as Cheniere's CFO. I want to personally thank Michael for standing by my side over the last four years. And more importantly, for all of his contributions to Cheniere's success over the last close to 16 years. Michael will be missed and we wish him well on his future endeavors. Succession planning and employee development are core principles here at Cheniere and for our Board. And I am pleased to announce that effective immediately Zach Davis, our Senior Vice President of Finance will assume the role of Chief Financial Officer. Zach has been with Cheniere for nearly seven years, during which time he has led our capital markets activities and has also been responsible for capital planning, financial planning and in the corporate budget. Please join me in congratulating Zach on his new role and you will hear more from him later on this call. Now turn to slide 5. In the second quarter of 2020, we generated $1.4 billion of consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow of approximately $570 million on revenues of $2.4 billion. This resulted in net income attributable to common stockholders of approximately $200 million. Despite continued challenges in the LNG market environment, driven by short-term supply and demand dynamics that are amplified by the impacts of the pandemic. I'm pleased today to reconfirm our 2020 full year guidance ranges of $3.8 billion to $4.1 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion in distributable cash flow. This further illustrates Cheniere's strength and resiliency of our business model and contract structures and our ability to execute on our plan. During the second quarter our long-term customers further utilized the optionality in their contracts by canceling cargoes at both SBL and CCL. As you know, this results in customers paying us the fixed liquefaction fee related to those cargoes and extinguishes our obligation to produce those cargoes. As we discussed in our call last quarter, when this situation occurs we recognize the revenue associated with those cargoes upon receipt of the notice of cancellation, which creates a timing mismatch when looking at our business on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Zach will discuss this in more detail in his remarks. During the second quarter, we produced and exported 78 cargoes of LNG. Since the start-up of operations, we have produced and exported over 80 million tons of LNG from our projects, which has reached over 35 countries and regions around the world. In May, the date of first commercial delivery or DFCD was reached under the long-term SBAs related to Train 2 at Corpus Christi. We have successfully onboarded these long-term customers and we welcome them to the Cheniere complex. While the environment in the spot LNG market remains relatively weak, I'm encouraged that dynamics in the LNG market are improving and unfolding as we have expected. As worldwide economies have begun to recover from the pandemic, we are beginning to see short-term gas prices stabilize and spreads are beginning to improve as we look into the winter months and beyond. The long-term fundamentals supporting our business remain firmly intact as a structural shift to clean burning natural gas continues to progress. Anatol will provide a more fulsome update on the global LNG market momentarily. Our current construction efforts continue our legacy of best-in-class execution. Bechtel is constructing Corpus Christi Train 3 and Sabine Pass Train 6 on accelerated schedules, well ahead of guaranteed time lines and within budget. Corpus Christi Train 3 is over 90% complete and Bechtel commenced early commissioning activities on Train 3 during the second quarter introduced first fuel gas in early July and is maintaining a substantial completion estimate of the first half of next year. We certainly look forward to taking care custody and control of the eight train from Bechtel ahead of schedule and within budget early next year. Sabine Pass Train 6 is approximately 64% complete. And Bechtel has recently informed us of an acceleration to the Train 6 timeline now projecting substantial completion to be achieved in the second half of 2022 ahead of the previous estimate of the first half of 2023. In addition, we recently issued full notice to proceed to Bechtel on the construction of the third marine birth at Sabine Pass and that project is expected to be complete in the first half of 2023. Our finance team was very busy during the second quarter and they were extremely successful in executing our financial strategy. In aggregate, we raised almost $4.7 billion through early July strategically addressing near-term maturities and replacing higher cost debt across multiple entities within the Cheniere structure. I'll touch upon a couple of the transactions. First in May, we refinanced the nearest term maturity in our complex by issuing $2 billion, a 4.5% notes due 2030 at Sabine Pass liquefaction. Then we raised a three-year delayed draw term loan at Cheniere of almost $2.7 billion in order to redeem the 2025 convertible notes issued by Corpus Christi Holdco II and a portion of the 2021 convertible notes issued by Cheniere. This flexible cost effective bank capital enables us to settle the convertible notes with cash as opposed to issuing equity, preventing dilution, which we had previously modeled in our run rate guidance. While we did not repurchase shares under our share repurchase program during the second quarter these strategic transactions resulted in a reduction in run rate share count of over 40 million shares. That's all of Zach's thunder that I'll steal on the refinancings. But investors should recognize that these are material accomplishments, which not only address near-term maturities and relatively high cost debt, but also demonstrate our strong ability to access the capital markets even in this period of volatility and uncertainty, which speaks to the reputation and strength of Cheniere's business with our banks and institutional capital providers. Now turn to slide 6. In early July, we published our inaugural corporate responsibility report titled, First and Forward. The publication of this report represents a significant step forward in Cheniere's commitment to transparency and sustainability reporting and will form the foundation of our disclosures around ESG risks and opportunities going forward. The development of this report was led by Chris Smith, our Senior VP of Policy Government and Public Affairs; our dedicated climate and sustainability team; and by a cross-functional team of subject matter experts from nearly every business unit within the company because ESG issues touch nearly every business unit within the company. The report identifies and reports on approximately 70 key disclosures across six-key things; climate, environment, workforce, health and safety, community and governance. Our key themes and disclosures in line with the recommendations of a leading reporting standards such as the taskforce on climate related financial disclosures, or TCFD, the sustainability accounting standards board and others. Sustainability is a priority at Cheniere and our urgency to address the key considerations of ESG issues is core to our operations and shared values. As such we are committed to transparency and how we report on these issues. We have an excellent evolving story to tell on environmental social and governance issues and we hope this message is communicated clearly in our inaugural report. And now, I'll turn the call over to Anatol, who will provide an update on the LNG market. And I'll say Christine, this is Jack. That we have tested all aspects of our business model including our flexibility and reliability of the way these trains have been designed and/or operated. So we -- the supply response that you saw from the U.S. LNG industry to low prices is what we were designed to handle. And that's what we did. And we took advantage of some opportunities of other facilities that maybe couldn't respond so quickly and we were able to buy significantly cheaper LNG from them and have it delivered to meet our CMI requirements. Yes. As Anatol highlighted, we're seeing a strong recovery in LNG demand growth especially in Asia. And I'd say we are cautiously optimistic that the economies around the world will come back. We'll continue to see the growth. Hopefully, we get some cooler weather in this winter and we'll see spreads continue to increase. And Christine I'll add our Beijing office is open. They've been extremely busy, back at work back entertaining different clients and customers. And I'm very pleased with how the relationship is forming with our Chinese counterparts. Good morning, Jeremy. So first Jeremy just on cancellation of cargo. So we've given a lot of disclosures in this queue. And there's just some basic rules that you could back calculate number of cargoes. And I'll ask Zach just to kind of walk through that part of it for you first.\nA \u2013 Zach Davis: Sure. So I think we mentioned, Jeremy. But I think we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're reducing production from the facilities from Q1 to Q2 by about 180 TBtu. Just define that by 3.5 TBtu. So that's about 50 cargoes. And then if you look at the numbers that we were talking about. Pretty much each cargoes up let's say on average very simple, $10 or so. So -- and while we're not going to comment on individual customers and their cancellations. I would also add in there Jeremy that you had the pandemic -- you had a warm winter first and you had the pandemic and then you follow that up with the shoulder months and things looked a little bleak. I mean as I said I'm cautiously optimistic that we're beyond that. And we're starting to ramp up. I'll turn it over to Anatol if he has anything to add. I'll start with the de-bottlenecking. So we've taken this opportunity with the customers canceling cargoes to move some maintenance forward. So we're doing a significant amount of work on the trains with our own crews. Because of COVID, we want to minimize a number of outside contract crews at our facilities, but they're doing a great job working around the clock in some cases. And we feel very good about our ability to optimize the output of those trains. In November when we give guidance for 2021 it's my expectation that we'll have a revision to our production guidance also as well as a run rate guidance that Zach had mentioned. Zach do you have anything you want to add? Good morning, Michael. So first \u2013 Michael, thanks. So I want to give a shout out to Bechtel in the Cheniere E&C team because we moved swiftly on isolating crews and putting in well beyond what the CDC was recommending different policies and procedures to ensure that there wouldn't be a big impact on the engineering and construction effort. And that if there was an impact it wouldn't impact our operating forces at our facilities. So it has worked extremely well. And Bechtel has done a good job at managing their COVID cases that they have had and made sure that they didn't run rampant throughout the construction effort. We had some good weather that allowed Bechtel on the E&C -- Cheniere and E&C team to make up a lot of lost ground. And up until recently now where we've had some tropical storms a little bit of hurricane activity. They were able to significantly progress both Corpus Christi Train 3 and Sabine Pass Train 6. So I'm very, very pleased with what they're able to do. I think if you're asking me my view on the rest of the LNG market as Anatol mentioned in his prepared remarks, we've seen a significant number of our competitors either delay or cancel their liquefaction plans. And it's put us on much stronger footing in the marketplace than we were pre COVID. And I'll look at Anatol. Michael, if it's all right with you. I'm going to start with the second part of that and then I'll hand it over to Anatol for the first part of it. So as you know, we're always looking for strategic opportunities, and especially where we believe we have a competitive advantage. And we can leverage our scale in our platform. And it's not lost on me that we move four hydrogen atoms for every carbon atom that we sell that we're a leader in developing, constructing, operating and owning cryogenic infrastructure here in America. So in addition, we believe that LNG has a major role to play in this whole global decarbonization effort across the globe. And that hydrogen may present an opportunity to complement those environmental benefits, as well as leverage our own core competencies in terms of market access, infrastructure development, operations, construction as Anatol mentioned. So you would expect that I am extremely excited about our prospects and about evaluating our opportunities to participate in the hydrogen market. And I don't know Anatol if you... Well on this call we're reconfirming our guidance for the year. And which as you know we gave that guidance back in November of 2019 which was pre-COVID. And to me that would be a massive success. And I'd be popping a lot of champagne at the end of this year. It has been extremely stressful and a tough year. Thanks, Sean. Ben, I'll say, we spent a lot of time looking at bunkering and how we can be a service to the bunkering market. I am not a big believer of shipping LNG on rail myself, but it doesn't mean there may not be an opportunity for somebody. But, our quantity of LNG that we produce and ship every day is massive. So that is a very small -- would be a very small stream for us or business line for us. This makes a lot. And I want to thank everybody for their support over this quarter. And I hope everyone stays safe and healthy."

            "content": "Thanks, Anatol and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be here this morning. Over the last few years I've met many of you at investor events, conferences or in conjunction with our capital markets transaction. I look forward to getting out and meeting with more of the investment community, virtually for now, but hopefully in person at some point soon. Michael certainly leaves big shoes to fill but I'm beginning my role as CFO with the benefit of having had him not just as a boss but also as a mentor for nearly seven years as he hired me to work for him at Cheniere back in 2013. Under his leadership during that time we have raised over $50 billion in capital and reached FID on five trains, including the first greenfield LNG project in the Lower 48. Together, we developed Cheniere's capital allocation framework and balance sheet strategy including getting both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi to investment grade and I fully intend to continue executing on those long-term plans. Michael delivered on Cheniere's long promised financial transformation which has accompanied our transition from development to operations and Cheniere is now in a strong financial position with investment-grade-rated projects, access to cost-effective capital and with the financial flexibility to de-lever, grow, provide capital returns or all of the above. When Michael became CFO, we had no EBITDA and most of the numbers on our financial statements had parentheses around them. But this year we'll generate around $4 billion of EBITDA and we are nearing an inflection point on free cash flow. To say I'll miss working side-by-side with Michael every day is an understatement but with the benefit of his guidance and mentorship over the last seven years, I'm confident that I'm well equipped to lead a smooth transition and to continue -- Slide 12. For the second quarter we generated net income of $197 million, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.4 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $570 million. For the first half of the year, we generated net income of $572 million, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of over $2.4 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $830 million. For the first half of the year, we exported 727 TBtu of LNG from our liquefaction projects. We exported 274 TBtu of LNG or 78 cargoes, from our liquefaction projects during the second quarter. Total volumes exported were almost 40% or almost 182 TBtu, lower than exports in the first quarter of this year, primarily as a result of cargoes for which long-term customers elected not to take delivery. Additionally, we fulfilled some marketing sales utilizing third-party sourced cargoes, during the second quarter. For the second quarter we recognized an income, 305 TBtu of LNG produced at our liquefaction projects. And 34 TBtu of LNG sourced from third parties. Approximately 77% of the LNG volumes recognized, in income during the second quarter, was sold under either long-term SBAs or IPM agreements and the remaining 23% was sold by our marketing affiliate, either into the spot market or under short and medium-term contracts. Volumes sold under SBA or IPM agreements, decreased by approximately 113 TBtu, compared to the first quarter of 2020, driven primarily by cargoes for which long-term customers chose, not to take delivery of LNG, partially offset by the impact of reaching the data first commercial delivery or DFCD, under the long-term SBAs related to Corpus Christi Train 2 on May 1st. For the first half of the year, we recognized an income 764 TBtu of LNG produced, at our liquefaction projects and 48 TBtu of LNG sourced from third parties. As Jack mentioned, during the second quarter, our results were impacted by the timing of recognition of revenue related to cargo cancellations. When customers notify us that, they do not intend to lift cargoes flexibility, we provide them in their contracts. We recognize the related revenue, the fixed fees for those cargoes, at the time the notice is received. During the second quarter, we recognized revenue of over $700 million, related to, cancelled cargoes, including $458 million related to cargoes that would have been lifted during the third quarter, if customers had elected to lift the cargoes. Excluding the impact of cancelled cargoes, originally scheduled for the third quarter. And the $53 million impact of second quarter cargoes that were cancelled and recognized in the first quarter, our total revenues would have been $2 billion for the second quarter and approximately $4.65 billion, for the first half of 2020. The impact on consolidated adjusted EBITDA is similar to the impact on revenue. The impact of cargo cancellations on the recognition of fixed fees in our financial statements is one of timing, as we continue to record revenue and receive fixed fees under our long-term contracts overtime. But the forward nature of these cancellation notices means our results may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, depending upon the number of cancellations for each period. To be clear, the aggregate impact of this revenue recognition timing, consideration to our financials over time is zero. When the global LNG market returns to balance and our projects return to full utilization, the current impact will reverse. And we may have a quarter with lower EBITDA. Income from operations for the second quarter was $937 million, a decrease of over $400 million, compared to the first quarter. The decrease was primarily due to the non-recurrence of net mark-to-market gains from the changes in fair value of commodity derivatives, which occurred in the first quarter. And increased costs incurred in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the $458 million of revenue recognized for cargoes cancelled during the second quarter, that were scheduled to be lifted during the third quarter. Excluding the impact of out-of-period cancellations, total margins on LNG were materially consistent in the first quarter to the second quarter. As a slight decrease in volumes sold, was offset by an increase in margins per MMBtu of LNG, which was driven by a higher proportion of volumes sold under long-term contracts, during the second quarter. Net income attributable, to common stockholders for the second quarter was $197 million or $0.78 per share, basic and diluted a decrease of over $175 million from the first quarter of 2020. This decrease was driven primarily by the decrease in income from operations, and increased loss on modification or extinguishment of debt partially offset by decreased interest rate derivative loss and decreased income tax expense. Turn now to slide 13. During the second quarter, we completed multiple financial transactions to address the nearest term debt maturities, across our structure which Jack touched on earlier. In May, SPL issued $2 billion or 4.5% senior secured notes, due 2030, and used the proceeds from the offering to redeem its senior secured notes, which were set to mature, in February 2021. In June, we entered into a $2.62 billion three-year delayed draw term-loan credit agreement, which was upsized in July to $2.695 billion to address the 11% CCH Holdco II convertible notes, due 2025 and our 2021 convertible notes. In July, we drew on the term loan to redeem all of the 11% convertible notes outstanding, at CCH Holdco II with cash, at a price of $1,080 per $1,000 principal amount. And we repurchased $844 million of the 2021 convertible notes outstanding at the Cheniere level at individually negotiated prices from a small number of investors. We anticipate using the remaining capacity under the term loan facility, along with cash on hand, to repay and/or repurchase the remaining outstanding 2021 convertible notes. After these transactions, there's approximately $465 million principal outstanding for the 2021 convertible notes and undrawn capacity of $372 million on the CEI term loan. These convertible notes transactions address the significant portion of a near-term maturity, eliminated the most expensive debt within our structure, simplified our capital structure and prevented significant share dilution that would have occurred if these notes were converted to shares. These transactions reduce our expected run rate share count by over 40 million shares or about 15%, thereby increasing our expected run rate distributable cash flow per share. With the 2021 maturities effectively addressed, the next maturity in the Cheniere complex is not until 2022. In the meantime, we will continue to manage our maturity profile by opportunistically refinancing and/or paying down callable bank debt in our structure, subject to market conditions. We did not repurchase any shares under our share repurchase program during the second quarter, but clearly made significant progress on reducing run rate share count by redeeming convertible notes with cash. Though, we did so by increasing our consolidated leverage. With that said, we remain committed to the capital allocation priorities we released in mid-2019, including reducing our consolidated leverage to achieve investment-grade credit metrics across our structure. Including a consolidated debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the mid to high 4 times range. Refinancing the convertible notes with debt was not in our original run rate guidance and we are committed to using excess capital for debt reduction to achieve our leverage targets. This will be our capital allocation priority in the short and medium term. Last week, we announced the quarterly distribution for CQP, the payment of which will end the subordination period and trigger the conversion of the $135 million CQP subordinated units owned by Cheniere into common units of CQP on a one-for-one basis, further simplifying our capital structure. The distribution payment and subordinated unit conversion are expected to occur in mid-August. This week, Moody's investor service upgraded its rating of CCH's senior secured debt from Ba1 to Baa3. CCH is now rated investment-grade by all three rating agencies, a reflection of the strength of our project economics and a result of derisking the project over time, through increased equitization and completion progress. Before I turn the call over for Q&A, I'd like to review our 2020 guidance. As Jack mentioned we have a clear line of sight to achieving our financial goals for the year, despite continued market headwinds. And today we are reconfirming our 2020 full year guidance of consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $3.8 billion to $4.1 billion and distributable cash flow of $1 billion to $1.3 billion that we continue to track to the lower end of the EBITDA guidance range. As we have hedged market price exposure for almost all of our LNG production capacity this year, today a $1 move in market margin would result in approximately $35 million change in consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the year. With that sensitivity weighted to the upside, given today's market margins. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions. $10 million, yes. So when you account for that in Q2 not including what occurred in Q3 there was about $300 million of count cancellation, $250 million that stayed in the quarter and $50 million that were brought forward into Q1. That's about 30 long-term cargoes or so. So you can kind of break out what was CMI and what was the long-term customers. Hey Jeremy, it's Zach again. I'd say though we did raise debt for -- and instead of equitizing those converts and clearly added to the amount of debt paydown that will eventually need to do to get to IG. Really doesn't push out our targets of early to mid-2020s at this point. And now our ultimate goal is getting to let's say mid 4x range on a debt-to-EBITDA basis on a consolidated balance sheet. We think we should be in a good position for IG as soon as we cross over 5x and show that commitment to managing the balance sheet. And we always said the debt paydown won't really start in earnest until the back half of the 5-year plan. So once CCL Train 3, SPL Train 6 come online and the excess cash flow really ramps up, you'll see us really making a dent in it. And just to put in perspective with our numbers, over the next five years or so we're going to have approximately $10 billion of available cash. And once Train 6 comes online in 2022, we have almost $3 billion a year of distributable cash flow. So we feel pretty good that we have line of sight with our cash flow to achieve not only IG during that period of time, but have excess cash flow on top of that for future capital returns and even push forward with Stage three once it's commercialized. Let me make sure I understand the first part of that question was on cargo cancellations and how we account for them? Clearly, we brought in revenue - this is Zach. We brought in revenue from Q3 into Q2 of $450 million that would have normally been in Q3. That's really because they have to give us around two months notice if they're canceling. And if they give us notice that they're canceling, our obligations are complete so we can recognize the revenue. What you could see is year-to-date, our EBITDA is more -- well more than half of our guidance range. So we're accounting for this meaning that clearly in Q3 and then Q4 it should reverse to an extent because those revenues were brought forward. And based on just the curves today and how we see it, we do think our customers would be lifting. That's economic to be lifting through the winter. So you will see the reversal in Q3 or Q4. Sure. I mean, we're quite transparent on the run rate numbers. And when we go through the budget process, which we're literally kicking off now in preparation to make that guidance in the next quarter. We assume the 9-train program. And only once FID is made on the next project. Do we add those costs or those revenues to the forecast. So that's pretty transparent. But if you just look at this year and the quantum of cancellations that we've had and the fact that we've been able to reaffirm guidance that's all thanks to the great work that our operations team has done to offset a large portion of that lifting margin that we'd normally make on those liftings. Thank you. Yeah. I think you already wrote your research report. But I'll just summarize everything that we've accomplished so far this year just to help everybody appreciate what we've really done. So I'll start off by reiterating what was said in the prepared remarks that our commitment to get to EIG across the entire complex, but the early to mid-2020s has not wavered. However, we did mention going into this year that it would be a jump ball between debt paydown and buybacks. And if we had to defer debt pay down a little bit to be opportunistic with the stock. That's what we do. And that's exactly what you saw us do in the first half of this year. So in Q1 not only did we buy back over $150 million of shares. We bought back $300 million of the EIG notes that were -- that we gave guidance that we're going to convert. And with that we got that option for six months to take out the rest. So we immediately went to work on this term loan knowing that that could be incredibly attractive to us in terms of the cost, the runway, the callability to not only take out EIG but RRJ at the same time and just be able to say we have no maturities across the complex now till 2022. So yes, we reduced share count on a run rate basis. I mean, we came out with that run rate guidance in 2019. So we'll update it probably after budget at the November earnings call. But that's well over 40 million shares that we've saved in that run rate guidance. So now with where we stand we're going to focus on that debt paydown with the incremental leverage that we just raised. So you'll see us prioritizing debt pay down for the next few quarters as you would expect. And make a dent on this incremental leverage and ensure that we're still on that path to EIG by the mid -- early to mid-2020. And then I'll just note again that capital allocation gets a lot more impactful, once Train 3 comes online. Because at that point, we'll finally hit that inflection point that I mentioned earlier where we go from free cash flow negative to free cash flow positive. Like we've all been waiting for. So the numbers start to get a lot more meaningful then. And so we should be on a path to EIG. But at the same time be able to consider capital returns in 2021 again. And be ready for stage three once it's commercialized. Yes. This is Zach. Thanks for the question Sean. Those are unsecured notes at CEI due in 2045 with a rate around 4%. And what we just focused on was something due within a year and the most expensive debt on the whole balance sheet of 11%. So it's like another world those converts. So they're really not the priority for quite some time. So they're going to sit there. I think the conversion price is in the 140s. And when we get closer to that we can talk. But in the meantime we're going to focus on paying down debt in the bank deals. Those are totally callable and they're both secured at CEI and BCH. And that's the type of debt that we want to get rid of first. So when we receive the cash is the normal time period. So, even, if they canceled now or let's say in Q2 for Q3 delivery the actual cash will come in Q3. Sure. So for Train 6, I think, we said last quarter we had $1.4 billion left of unlevered costs before contingency. And that's down to $1.1 billion at this point. And then, in terms of Train 3, it was around $600 million or so. Let's just say, we're under $600 million at this point with \u2013 for Corpus before contingency and most of that will be spent this year with us being really deep in commissioning by early next year. Sure. In 2019, when we gave that investor update we said Cheniere share of these de-bottlenecking projects and some development costs would be around $700 million. I'd say that number is a few hundred \u2013 a couple or a few hundred million dollars less at this point just because we did spend some of that money to get to the higher ranges of our production at both sites. But that's over a five-year period. So it's not a huge amount of money when we're talking about over $10 billion of available cash."

At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Randy Bhatia, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nRandy Bhatia: Thanks operator, good morning everyone, and welcome to Cheniere's first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. The slide presentation and access to the webcast for today's call are available at cheniere.com. Joining me today are Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO; Anatol Feygin, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Michael Wortley, Executive Vice President and CFO. Before we begin, I would like to remind all listeners that our remarks including answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from what is described in these statements. Slide 2 of our presentation contains a discussion of those forward-looking statements and associated risks. In addition, we may include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measure can be found in the appendix of the slide presentation. As part of our discussion of Cheniere's results, today's call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP or CQP. We do not intend to cover CQP's results separately from those of Cheniere Energy Inc. The call agenda is shown on Slide 3. Jack will begin with operating and financial highlights, Anatol will then provide an update on the LNG market and Michael will review our financial results and guidance. After prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. I will now turn the call over to Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO.\nJack Fusco: Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today in downtown Huston to review our results from the first quarter of 2020. While, we usually host these earnings calls with a room full of executives and an office building full of employees, today, it's just the four of us in a large conference room as we're complying with the CDC recommended guidelines and our headquarter professionals are telecommuting. The first quarter of 2020 was a historic period and the global outbreak of COVID-19 has impacted our personal and professional lives in many ways. Our daily routines from commuting to work, educating our children, interfacing with colleagues, to visiting with friends and family, and everything in between has been offended, and we've all been forced to embrace a new reality. Watching this pandemic spread with lethal force across the globe has been an unbelievable experience, likewise, the response for stop the spread and focus on ultimately finding a solution to eradicate this virus has been unprecedented. I want to personally thank all of the medical professionals, who care for us in the first responders to test us, feed us, and provide for our safety for their tireless efforts, and we pray for their good health. Turning now to Slide 5. As Cheniere, we have built a strong resilient customer focused business, which is capable of weathering volatility in both the energy and financial markets. While skeptics may question this at time, we find ourselves in this historic volatility and uncertainty in both of these markets and the resilience of our business model is on full display. For the first quarter of 2020, we generated a record amount of consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $1.04 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately 250 million on revenues of $2.7 billion, and we generate a net income attributable to common stockholders of $375 million. Despite both supply and demand driven near-term weakness in the LNG market, I am pleased today to reconfirm our 2020 full year guidance ranges of $3.8 to $4.1 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion of distributable cash flow. The highly contracted nature of our business, the proactive risk management of our market exposure and our maniacal focus on operational excellence are key enablers of these results in a weak market environment. Our first quarter financial results and the reconfirmation of our full year 2020 guidance are testament to the resilience of our operational, contractual and financial foundations. We repurchased a $155 million of stock under a repurchase program during the quarter, and as we disclosed in our previous earnings call, we paid down $300 million of the CCH HoldCo convertible notes with cash. Michael will address our financial results in guidance and more detail in a few minutes. During the first quarter, we produced an export at 128 cargoes of LNG, including 100 cargo from Corpus Christi and the thousands of cumulative cargo. Since the start up of operations, we have produced and exported more than 75 million tons of LNG from our projects, which has reached 35 countries and regions worldwide. Looking ahead, the long-term SPAs tied to train to our Corpus Christi are set to commence tomorrow. We have been in the process of on-boarding those customers and we welcome them to the Cheniere complex. Instruction on Corpus Christi Train 3 and being past Train 6 continue to progress on accelerated schedules. Corpus Christi Train 3 is approximately 84% project completion. It's being past Train 6 is around 54% project completion. And both Trains are forecast to be significantly ahead of their guaranteed completion dates. Now turn to Slide 6, where I will spend a few moments describing Cheniere response to COVID-19 as it has been significant. We recognize the rest of COVID-19 and began implementing response measures early prior to many government imposed requirements. We have activated various emergency response teams including an executive management team and business support team, and a site management team. All of whom are focused on employee safety and welfare business continuity and maintaining operations at our liquefaction sites. These teams monitor status, develop and implement policies and protocols specific each office, location and site. In addition, they enforced protective measures. And most importantly regularly communicate with all the relevant personnel. In early March, we began consulting with a medical advisor and implemented social distancing to revise shift schedules, isolating work groups, work from home policies and restricted non-essential business travel, just to mention a few proactive items. In addition, we instituted minimum staffing levels at our sites, isolated our critical operating personnel, and began utilizing temporary onsite housing for our workforce at our sites. I'm extremely grateful and proud of our employees and their performance throughout this pandemic. On the engineering and construction side, we and our EPC partner, Bechtel, have implemented significant safety and emergency response protocols at both Sabine Pass in Corpus Christi to ensure workplace safety and business continuity. We've implemented many changes at the sites and pursuit of these priorities. That said we do not currently expect these measures or COVID-19 have a material impact on our project cost or schedule for either Corpus Christi Train 3 or Sabine Pass Train 6. I applaud our engineering and construction team and the Bechtel group for their swift and effective implementation of these protocols to ensure a flawless execution. The impact of COVID-19 to our country communities in those countries of our foundation customers has been unprecedented. As a company, community involvement and paying it forward is in our DNA. To-day, Cheniere has pledged over a million dollars to global COVID-19 release efforts. Our commitments and contributions are focused on the communities where we live and work Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Washington, D.C., London, Singapore and China. We're proud to do our part during this global outbreak to help reduce the food insecurity for those most in need and provide provisions and equipment for first responders and frontline healthcare workers. I'm extremely proud of our success of the personal protective equipment drive and partnership with Houston, the Astros Foundation and Project Care. Now turn to Slide 7, before the call over to Anatol, I want to quickly discuss certain aspects of our long-term contracts. In the wake of the dislocations we've seen in both the financial and energy markets over these last few weeks, we've received countless investor inquiries regarding our long-term contracts. First, regarding our contract sanctity, I remind you that our long-term contracts do not include provisions for renegotiations. We intend to meet all of our contractual obligations, and in return, we expect our customers to do the same. Second, regarding cargo lifting elections, as I mentioned on our call in February, we won't make it a practice describe the details of ordinary interactions with our customers to the market, including their decisions regarding lifting of cargoes. But as you all know, one of the primary flexibilities granted to our long-term customers within their contracts is their right to cancel or suspend cargoes with appropriate notice. In instances where that occur, the fixed liquefaction fee is still paid to us and our marketing is selling as the option to market the volume into the global marketplace. As global markets remain weak, we have had customers elect to cancel some additional cargoes. We won't quantify the amount, but we reiterate that our customers value the flexibility inherent in the contract structure and our visibility to achieving our financial guidance for the year is unchanged. Similarly regarding speculation and confusion around force majeure or FM, which we addressed in our prior call as well, FM clauses in our FOB contracts specifically exclude such events as the unavailability of or any event affecting downstream LNG facilities, changes in the customer's market factors or other commercial, financial or economic conditions. As such, depressed gas prices globally or economic fallout or decrease gas demand from COVID-19 do not provide a valid legal basis on which a counterpart can claim FM. And now, I'll turn the call over to Anatol, who will provide an update on the LNG market.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Jack, and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 9. We'll start with an overview of the global LNG markets during the first quarter, which was quite eventful before looking in more detail at ongoing trends in Europe and Asia. The LNG market continues to grow during the first quarter with output at a record level of almost a 100 million tons, about 10 million tons of new LNG supply were added in Q1, was about 70% coming from the U.S. This came on the heels of the approximately 40 million tons of new LNG supply in 2019. While some new trains started up in the first quarter, Cameron Train 2 and two units at Elba, much of the capacity added last year is also now fully ramped up and contributing to higher supply. The continued supply surge entered an already amply supplied global market, which is now also trying to cope with the pandemic. The coronavirus affected several LNG importing countries sequentially during the first quarter. It temporarily reduced demand for LNG in China and will ultimately impact demand in other countries in similar ways. Amid reports of lockdowns and delays in cargo deliveries in China, the year-on-year reduction in imports was relatively benign at less than 1 million tons in Q1. However, the total impact on demand in Europe and South Asian countries is still uncertain. We observed a quick recovery in China in March and return to demand growth in the JKT area during the quarter led by South Korea and Taiwan. We also observed a marked increase in demand in South Asian markets as a result of attractive price levels with India leading the charge during the quarter. In total, Asia's LNG imports increased 7% or over 4 million tons year-on-year. Meanwhile, Europe continue to import record quantities of LNG 25% higher year-on-year as supply growth provided ample residual LNG to flow to Europe. Europe absorbed most of the quarterly incremental LNG deliveries from the U.S., while flows to Asia remain flat quarter-on-quarter. U.S. deliveries to Europe increased more than 40% quarter-on-quarter to over 8 million tons during Q1. These LNG supply and demand dynamics, the coronavirus and a precipitous drop in oil prices since early March, have continued to exert pressure on global gas prices. TTF average $3.35 during the first quarter, over 50% lower year-on-year. Similarly, JKM averaged 482 in Q1 more than 40% lower than the first quarter of 2019. After a $58 a barrel settlement in March, Brent futures tumbled to below $25 in the days following a lack of agreement by OPEC+ on March 6th. Henry Hub's March contract settled at $1.82, significantly lower than the $2.86 March 2019 settlement. This confluence of various factors and uncertainty about economic growth has led many companies to rationalize capital spend, and for several developers to reconsider the viability of their planned LNG projects, both domestically and abroad. We've already seen announcements of FID delays and cancellations from projects totaling over 100 million tons per annum of capacity. The chart on the far right of this slide shows our perspective on projects thought to be most likely to reach FID in 2020 and '21.In early 2019, we expect the projects totaling approximately 100 million tons per annum of capacity to have a reasonable chance of FID in 2020, and another 30 million tons of capacity in 2021. After the demand and supply shocks, which began during the first quarter, we anticipate that FIDs in 2020 will be much lower totaling under 15 million tons per annum of capacity, with some projects shifting to the 2021 FID and others delayed even further. We now expect up FIDs for the two year periods to total approximately 65 million tons are about half of our previous forecast. Supply and demand dynamics are tightening the competitive landscape driving some LNG projects with higher breakeven thresholds out of the probable FID stack. We do include our Corpus Christi Stage 3 expansion in these expected FIDs which will be dependent upon, among other things, obtaining sufficient commercial agreements to support the project. We remain confident in our competitive position and ability to leverage existing infrastructure and other competitive advantages to provide cost effective supplies to the market to satisfy growing long term LNG demand. Please turn to Slide 10 to review the European market in more detail. I mentioned earlier the tough market conditions through the first quarter led to record levels of U.S. LNG flowing into Europe. Over 55% of U.S. LNG deliveries in the first quarter are over 8 million tons flow to Europe. In total, over 27 million tons of LNG landed in Europe during the quarter, an increase of approximately 25% year-on-year. The growth in LNG imports was partially accommodated by year-on-year declines in indigenous gas production and lower imports from pipeline gas. Pipeline gas flows declined by about 6 Bcf a day during the quarter equivalent to approximately 165 LNG cargoes. However, power generation from wind, solar and other renewables was up approximately 20% year-on-year in Q1 keeping some pressure on European stores inventories, which in the absence of a cold winter retain their surplus, ending March over 0.5 trillion cubic feet higher than the prior year. While it remains too early to gauge and isolate the impact of the coronavirus on European balances, we're seeing its impact on overall gas demand in some of the continent's major gas markets, as gas demand in Europe, six main gas markets declined year-on-year in Q1. However, longer term, we continue to be constructive on gas demand in Europe as the energy landscape changes due to the region's decarbonization goals. Countries in Europe plan to either retire, decommission and/or cut approximately 100 gigawatts of coal and nuclear capacity in aggregate by 2030. We believe that gas will be an important part of the transition away from solid fuels and will continue to play a role in ensuring Europe is in a good position to manage grid reliability needs. Please turn from Slide 11 to look at LNG market dynamics in Asia. Despite the coronavirus pandemic, LNG imports in Asia increased by about 7% year-on-year to 68 million tons in the first quarter. While this growth is not insignificant, the demand response to lower LNG prices would have likely been more pronounced, if not for the impact of the virus. Soft prices along domestic infrastructure, the bottlenecking a lot of price sensitive buyers in South and Southeast Asia to offer support to the market, when Chinese demand was soft. However, as we've seen in China, lockdowns and the resulting the flying and economic activity could place a limit on demand growth in the coming months. Strict virus containment measures resulted in a steep economic contraction in China in February. This resulted in reduced imports of LNG and central Asian gas by 0.9 million tons and half a Bcf a day respectively, year-on-year. However, as most large industrial enterprises resumed work across the nation, Chinese LNG imports started recovering in March. In the JKT region, a year long decline and imports was reversed as both South Korea and Taiwan continues to take a tough stance on Colburn offering support to gas fired power generation demand. South Korea has mandated maintenance could coal plants decreased coal fired power generation in January and February by 15% versus last year. And Taiwan's coal fired power generation dropped 4.5% year-on-yea. In Japan weak power demand and mild temperatures reduce the need for LNG imports, despite lower nuclear availability compared to last year. In the coming few months, we do expect three nuclear reactors to go offline as a result of not meeting antiterrorism requirements. In addition to the Sendai number one nuclear reactor that was taken offline recently. These outages are expected to offer some upside for LNG demand in the coming weeks and months. Fundamentally, we could also see upside to LND demand as a result of various stimulus packages that are being rolled out. In China for example, several provinces announced 2020 infrastructure expansion plans as the nation reopens the economy. Some of these plans include LNG, we gasification projects and gas fired power generation projects, which would contribute more firmly to expectations of China to double his current gas fired power generation fleet by 2030. China's gas fired power capacity is expected to reach 200 gigawatts in the coming decade more than doubling from about 90 gigawatts currently. as a country seeks to reach peak CO2 emissions by 2030. To conclude, the market is currently experiencing extremely unusual conditions that are hurting bearish pressures across the entire commodity complex. Guest stories levels in Europe were high, costs prices there are likely to remain weak until stories levels normalized. Well, the demand impact of the coronavirus remains uncertain in the near-term. We expect that many concerns will be alleviated in the coming months as the world recovers from the pandemic, lockdowns are lifted and economic activity resumed. Looking beyond the current market events, we believe that long-term fundamentals have not changed and that LNG remains a reliable, competitive and flexible solution for the energy needs of both Asia and Europe. And finally, we believe that the current market and economic conditions, although challenging and improving our competitive position over the medium to longer term. Thank you for your time and attention. I'll now turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Wortley: Thanks, Anatole, and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 13. For the first quarter, we generated net income of 375 million consolidated adjusted EBITDA of 1.04 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately 250 million. We explored 453 TBtu of LNG or 128 cargoes from our liquefaction projects during the first quarter. LNG production levels were relatively flat as compared to fourth quarter 2019. For first quarter, we recognized an income 459 TBtu to LNG produced that our liquefaction projects and 14 TBtu of LNG source from third parties. Approximately 79% of the 473 Tbtu of LNG recognized and income during the first quarter was sold under either long-term SPA or IPM agreements, and the remaining 21% was sold by our marketing affiliates, either into the spot market or under short and medium term contracts. Volume sold under SPAs or IPM agreements increased by approximately 20 Tbtu compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, driven primarily by seasonality of volumes under certain SPA, and by the commencement of our IPM arrangements with EOG which occurred in January. Income from operations for the first quarter was approximately $1.3 billion, an increase of over $300 million compared to the fourth quarter. This increase was primarily due to increased net mark to market gains from changes in fair value of commodity derivatives. Income from operations for the first quarter also includes revenues of approximately $50 million associated with cancelled LNG cargoes, which recognized upon notice of cancellation. Volumes of LNG recognized and income are materially consistent for the first quarter as compared to fourth quarter 2019 and realize margins per MMbtu of LNG decreased only slightly approximately 2% quarter-over-quarter. Net income attributable to common stockholders for the first quarter was $375 million, or $1.48 per share basic and $1.43 per share diluted, a decrease of over $500 million for fourth quarter 2019. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2019 was positively impacted my Tax Valuation allowance release of over $500 million, which did not occur in the first quarter. Net income for the first quarter also decreased as compared to the fourth quarter 2019 due to losses on derivatives related to our interest rate swaps partially offset by increased operating income. During the first quarter, we repurchased an aggregate of 2.9 million shares of common stock for a total of $155 million under our share repurchase program. As of the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $600 million of remaining capacity under the share repurchase program. Additionally, as we disclosed on a previous earnings call, in March, we amended the note purchase agreement for the Corpus Christi HoldCo convertible notes, enabling us to pay down $300 million of the outstanding balance of cash and allowing us the option to pay down the remaining outstanding balance in cash until September. This transaction reduced our total notional debt and prevented equity dilution of over 6 million shares. Turn now to Slide 14. Liquidity and financing related questions have been central topics among our investor base recently and understandably so, given recent disruptions in the global financial and energy markets. Cheniere is in a strong financial position with more than adequate liquidity, strong cash flow generation capability for the remainder of this year and into future years, and multiple options to address our upcoming debt maturities, the earliest of which doesn't occur until next year. We had approximately $4 billion of liquidity available for general corporate purposes as of the end of the first quarter, including cash on hand and undrawn balances under the working capital facilities and revolvers across our structure. In March, SPL entered into a new $1.2 billion working capital facility, which effectively refinance the prior working capital facility, lowered the interest rate, improve flexibility under certain covenants, and pushed out the maturity date from 2020 to 2025. The undrawn capacity under this facility, as well as under the CQP revolver, Corpus working capital facility, and parent level revolver provides a liquidity backstop should one become necessary. That said, we do not anticipate the need to draw on our facilities as a result of recent market conditions. Additionally, we do not currently have any concerns regarding our ability to comply with our debt covenants. We do not any external financing needs for the completion of construction of Corpus Train 3 or Sabine Pass Train 3. Those trains were financed approximately 50-50 debt equity and the debt financing of both Trains have been completed. Remaining equity commitments are expected to be funded using cash on hand and cash flow generated through the completion of construction. The nearest term debt maturity across our corporate structure is the 2 billion outstanding SBL 2021 notes, which mature in February of next year. Our team has been working on addressing that maturity since before we sent market disruptions. And as we have said previously, we expect to use some combination of both SBL and the investment grade market and CQP in the high yield market to refinance these notes. Sizing and timing of course will be dependent upon bond market conditions which located in March, but a since stabilized considerably. Also in 2021 at the LNG level, we have approximately 1.4 billion of outstanding convertible notes, which mature in May and have a conversion share price of approximately $94. As with the SBL bonds, we began strategizing on addressing these converts earlier this year and are evaluating options to redeem those notes including refinancing options. It's too early in the process to discuss specifics, but we expect to add multiple options to redeem or refinance these convertible notes. We\u2019re also considering financing options to redeem the remaining outstanding balance as a Corpus Christi HoldCo convertible notes due 2025 I mentioned a moment ago depending on market conditions. Jack mentioned despite headwinds and weakness in the global LNG market, remain confident in our ability to generate financial results within our guidance ranges this year, and today we are reconfirming our 2024 full year guidance. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA of 3.8 billion to 4.1 billion and distributable cash flow of 1 billion to 1.3 billion. So, we continue to track to the lower end of the EBITDA guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF guidance exclude the impact of one-time costs associated with our COVID-19 response efforts that Jack summarized. As we mentioned on the last call, we have pre-sold the large majority over 95% or LNG production for 2020, leaving our financial results less exposed to fluctuations in market pricing this year. Since the last call, we continued to put away unsold volumes for the remainder of 2020 and today a $1 move in market margin would result in approximately $60 million change in consolidated adjusted EBITDA, with that sensitivity weighted to the upside given today's market margins. With regard to capital allocation for the balance of the year, we designed the capital allocation framework to provide us with flexibility. With both energy markets and financial markets recently dislocating and considering the debt and convert maturities next year, I just discussed, we'll likely take advantage of that flexibility and take a more conservative approach with respect to our capital allocation decisions, at least until those markets stabilized and visibility improves. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to our first question from Shneur Gershuni of UBS.\nShneur Gershuni: Maybe for today's update, maybe just a couple of quick questions here, first off, we're kind of seeing clearly an atypical pricing environment right now. When thinking about international spreads with respect to U.S., Asia and Europe and so forth, obviously, it's a function of inventory imbalances and so forth, but the one big change that has occurred is the associated gas issue in the United States, Henry Hub, which is now higher. What is your analysis tell you about whether there will be a long-term market structure change due to the higher U.S. pricing? Or at the end of the day, will there always be a call for U.S. LNG, and as the market will just re-price accordingly, and the spreads will go back to normal once COVID and inventory bounces clear out?\nJack Fusco: Well thank you. Thanks for the question. I think we'll have Anatol address a long-term, his view over the long term gas market.\nAnatol Feygin: Good morning, Shneur, and thanks for the question. Obviously, we've had a large decline and we think we'll continue to see a decline in oil directed drilling activity that will have an effect on associated gas production. We think that over the medium term that will be modest, and as prices normalize in North America, you've already seen the big response in Cal 21 trading over $2.70 will be very attractive for gas directed drilling and the production that will come from that. We obviously are at the very tail end in terms of the infrastructure build out for Phase 1 of LNG facilities. So that large demand driver will have and we fully expect to see a relatively stable NYMEX going forward between $2.5 and $3 is where the curves are today. Even in these unprecedented times, I'll just point out that the volatility -- realized volatility on NYMEX has been substantially lower than on crude or even JKM. And we do expect that, that North American gas production and pricing will be attractive relative to global levels and the opportunity over the medium to longer term to safely reliably and economically supply our customers will be very attractive.\nShneur Gershuni: Yes, appreciate the color, thank you for that. And maybe it's just some quick follow ups here. Is there any opportunities just given the structure in the market right now for CMI or Cheniere to actually benefit from that? And I know that in terms of financing, you can't make too many comments, but could you comment on what do you think the market is open or not for the convertible notes?\nMichael Wortley: Yes, it's Michael. I'll take the second question and then let Anatol handle the first one. But as we said, we have two maturities, the SPL maturity. And we have no maturity this year, but the first one is in February of next year. If you look at SPL complex that entire market -- that entire complex is above par and trading well below 5%. So, that market is we think certainly open to us and we'll deal with that sometime over the balance of the year. In terms of CEI, we're working on several options to deal with that convert, which, again, is not until the summer of next year. But as I said in the prepared remarks, we've been thinking about that already. And I think some combination of the bank market, the bond market, current liquidity and prospective cash flow, or some combination thereof will allow us to deal with those converts. So, I wouldn't speak specifically is the convert market open to us. I mean, we're looking at a lot a lot of options. I'm fairly certain the bang market is open to us. It's just a question of quantum. And so, we're working through that right now to deal with that convert in the summer next year. And ideally, if we can get the right quantum to go ahead and deal with the EIG notes of Corpus Christi HoldCo to which aren't pending maturity, but it is highest cost paper in the complex. So, we'll see how that plays out here over the coming months and be pretty proactive in picking some combination of those alternatives to sort that out.\nAnatol Feygin: Sure. To the first part of your question, NYMEX has been less volatile, but all sides as you know have been quite volatile and just want to thank the teams that we haven't seen in a couple months, but talk through on a regular basis for their tireless efforts in that, taking advantage of some of those opportunities. So, no one is sitting on their hands, and as market opportunities present themselves as you would expect, Cheniere marketing is taking advantage of those, but clearly we won't give you any specific details around that.\nOperator: We'll go to our next question from Jeremy Tonet from JP Morgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to touch base with regards to how everything's working out. I guess this is the first time the business model has seen a number of cancellations and non-lifts. And just want to see, if everything is kind of functioning the way that you guys expected. Is there any kind of unexpected surprises there? If there's a large quantum, would that stress anything in your network as far as putting the gas back into the market or any thoughts you can share on that process?\nJack Fusco: Jeremy, this is Jack. Thanks for the question and thanks for your support and involvement here at Cheniere. I just have to say, I'm extremely proud of the organization. Our ability even when we're separated to communicate and coordinate has been fantastic. Their ability to actually assemble during the, prior to the pandemic and put policies and procedures in place to ensure that our employees were safe and that our business continuity continued has been incredible. Randy gave you some nice pictures in the slides of the camps. I'm so grateful for the employees that we're willing to sacrificing with her families to live in those camps and ensure that our operations were stable. So I would say that, it's an unprecedented time, as Anatol said, it's extremely volatile out there. Our customers still need gas. We're hopeful for the day when industrial and commercial demand can you come back into the worldwide market. And hopefully, we're seeing some signs of green shoots there, but no, there's been no surprises.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks Jack. Just, Jeremy said on top of that, as you know, we have obviously very good relationships with our now 20-ish or so counterparties, they value the flexibility in these contracts too to cancel. They give us substantial notice and as Jack said, the coordination between all of the functions including our gas procurement team and that notice has been exceptional. And the teams haven't missed a beat, and our customers are appreciative and obviously respectful of those notices, so far so good. Thank you.\nJeremy Tonet: And then maybe just, if I could on kind of longer term strategy, if any thoughts you could share with regards to how far out you're able to hedge, looking to hedge at this point to de-risk cash flows? And I think Michael was talking about capital allocation. It seems like the market has a bit more emphasis on free cash flow as opposed to growth. So I don't know if it's kind of been any shift in your overall strategy taking kind of broader changes we've seen in the market in the macro backdrop?\nJack Fusco: Now, I think we'd like our position. Last November when we gave you all guidance, I told you we were materially hedge for the year prior. You should expect us to manage the business conservatively and not want to take a lot of market risk. And I have complete confidence when we convert that market risk to operating risk and my operating staff will be ready willing and able to provide. So, I don't want to get into our book or the market. Liquidity in this market, it's been a little bit rough these days, as you can imagine.\nOperator: And we'll move to our next question from Michael Webber of Webber Research.\nMichael Webber: First one, Jack, it's for you and maybe Anatol as well. But Jack you mentioned and you kind of addressed kind of some of the FM buzz that kind of comes up anytime. There's a market disruption and that the notion of cancelling a cargo versus interrupting a 20-year contract is very different things and the markets already litigated this degree for 14-year. But I'm curious, if you kind of looks if we just assume that Cheniere going to get insulated and we kind of look at the broader market. Do you think you've got other counterparties or peers, if you think about contracts that might not be papered up to the same degree that the years are? Do you think this is something where we could see from that, that endpoints on long-term contracts elsewhere, kind of bubbled to the surface? I know, you preemptively declared FM on a project in Mauritania on the back of 2022 market conditions. Obviously, it's a very, very different scenario than to be in Corpus. But just curious, obviously, you guys don't like dealing with those questions because the answer has been the same for as long as I've covered the Company. But I'm just curious whether if you look at this across the entire industry, do you think this is something that kind of percolates elsewhere?\nJack Fusco: So, Michael, as you know, I'm relatively young in this industry. So, I'll take the first part of it, and I'll hand it over to Anatol to help with a more longer term on some of the other SPAs that you highlighted. We feel very comfortable with our customer base and with our SPAs that our customers have been given the flexibility to cancel the cargoes with as Anatol said long term notice, and lets us plan around what we need to do. It gives them a good option, they value that option. And we're seeing them utilize it the way they would utilize it. We don't see the risk of FM portfolio for Cheniere. As far as other entity other projects, I'll let Anatol to address that part.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks Michael. Obviously, we can't comment on others and what's embedded in the SPAs. But clearly there has to be some ability to vanish some kind of a relief valve. In our case it is it is those cancellations in other cases where there are fixed volumes to fixed destinations other tools apply. And it's not surprising that, that FM is a path to manage that exposure. I can't obviously comment on anyone in particular. But clearly, the FOB SPA is a very different animal than something you would traditionally see that has a lot less flexibility embedded.\nMichael Webber: Jack, another one that I think, I and other people kind of asked before, but the market conditions are obviously different now and you guys have been hyper focused on building out your existing footprint in the past several years. You obviously still in kind of an extended commercialization process for Corpus Phase 3. But if I kind of look around at some of the greenfields around, you are starting to flounder, you're seeing people pull back from the market, and all things considered, you guys are in a pretty advantageous and strong position. I'm just curious, what would you need to see for you to take a serious look at adding some particularly cheap optionality by kind of stepping into, it's kind of a greenfields shelving it for a couple years and saying, what is there if we want to expand at some point, maybe adding some geographical diversity or something that's not in your portfolio now? I'm just curious, how close are you to seriously looking at something like that?\nJack Fusco: Michael, we have a not enough organic growth to satisfy our needs for many, many years to come both at Corpus Christi and at Sabine Pass. And we have the existing infrastructure there. And as you mentioned, we already have permitted expansions at Corpus that we're ready, willing and able to do. I think, the first thing I would need to see is the airlines open back up. And that's to be able to travel. These are associations for long-term energy contracts that require a face-to-face combat, for lack of a better word. I mean you have to get close to the customer and look each other in the eye and for the foreseeable future now, or at least initially that looks like it's a little ways away for us. But I don't know, Michael, do you have anything to add.\nMichael Wortley: I mean, we have a team that kind of spends a lot of time looking at what's going on around us and around the world, and we've looked at a lot of things. But as Jack said, everything's got to come back and compete with our own organic projects, not only economically, but from an execution standpoint and certainty of execution. I've not really found anything that was any better than what we have. So, I would just echo Jack sentiments in that regard.\nOperator: We'll go to a question from Christine Cho of Barclays.\nChristine Cho: So maybe just operationally, when we think about the full year, how would you characterize the SPA listings over the fourth quarter when all the trains are up and running? How has the listing in 1Q and 4Q relative to 2Q and 3Q under a normal scenario?\nAnatol Feygin: Hey Christine, it's Anatol. So in terms of\u2026\nJack Fusco: If I could first, Christine, are you not asking me to give you quarterly guidance, are you on this call?\nChristine Cho: No, no, no. I'm just trying to think like maybe like percentages, because I mean I've noticed that the SPA listings seem to be higher in 1Q and 4Q. I'm just trying to get a sense of like, how we should be thinking about that on like under normal scenario, like longer?\nJack Fusco: So, as you know the plant, Sabine especially has a little bit of seasonality from the standpoint of production. In terms of the SPAs, they are fundamental ratable, but we do have some additional volumes that are, in accordance with the SPAs that are that are winter loaded. So you do have -- in terms of the SPAs, you have a little bit more contractual third-party sales in the winter. And in terms of plant production, you have a little bit more, but it's not very meaningful across the year. The big step function change of course, as you know, is the May 1 DFCDs of Corpus Train 2. So in terms of SPA'ed volume if you will, as of May 1, there's another step function change to get our full 7 train platform contracted.\nChristine Cho: Right, but I was just talking, under a scenario where all the trains are offering, I'm not necessarily looking for like this year. But I mean, it does seem like the SPA customers do have flexibility to few more pickups in 1Q and 4Q. I know you said, it's overall just little bit. Okay. And then a clarification question, Michael. I think in your elementary, did you say that you book revenue tied to a cancellation cargo when you receive the cancellation notice?\nMichael Wortley: That's right. So, the accounting rules say that, when our obligations are satisfied under the contract, we recognize the revenue. The payment terms are still the same. We don't get paid until we booked the revenue because we have no other obligations on a contract once we get the cancellation notice. So, that's right.\nChristine Cho: And isn't the cancellation -- doesn't cancellation orders have to be given like two months in advance? So does that mean there's like some accelerated revenue recognition that we could probably be in 2Q at the level of cancellation pickup?\nMichael Wortley: Yes, you got it. I mean, to the extent it swaps over into the next quarter, we're recognizing it in the current quarter, so\u2026\nChristine Cho: Okay, yes. And then for 1Q you said it was $50 million.\nMichael Wortley: That's right.\nChristine Cho: Okay, perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go to our next question from Craig Shere of Toy Brothers.\nCraig Shere: Good morning. I've got three quick ones here. So, just specific comment about or something about a temporary NGPL force majeure, is that a non-event as far as your inventories and keeping our business running in SPL? Outstanding CapEx that you envision through completion at this point for Corpus Train 3 and SPLT 6, and the comment, Michael, you said about the asymmetric upside, the spot market price changes. Presume that's us because there is a portion of equity cargoes that you assume won't ship this year. And does that effectively mean that there's no practical scenario where you're going to fall below the low end of guidance?\nJack Fusco: Let's start first one first, the NGPL force majeure from the lightning storm that blew through two nights ago.\nMichael Wortley: Non-H2O has already been lifted, and I callously did say a couple of responses that pipelines use FM like popping tick takes. So, it's a blunt instrument that, that they have which has not been and we don't expect to be an issue for us.\nCraig Shere: Okay, right. And then, Michael, outstanding our CapEx on trains?\nMichael Wortley: Yes, Q2 forward for Train 3 is about $600 million largely spent this year that's before contingency, so maybe a little bit more depending on how that plays out. And SPL is about 1.4 billion, SPL Train 6 1.4 really through 20, 30 at this point again, excluding contingency. Well, I mean we just effectively -- margins were low, right. So at some point, we have a stop loss and we don't lift. So that's why I faced the metric and its 30 million to the downside and 60 million to the upside. So, yes, I mean, we won't miss our guidance range because of marketing. I think that's a fair statement.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Spiro Dounis of Credit Suisse.\nSpiro Dounis: Just want to follow up on. I want to share questions around potential benefits from CMI. Maybe focusing on June, just give where a lot of the sort of widely reported cancellations have come, not just for your guys, but just generally in the industry. It seems like has a lot of potential to backup yet into the system here in the U.S. and potentially Henry Hub. So two part question there, to the extent that does happen and the does open up. I guess, how nimble can CMIB to lift of cargo effectively immediately or capture that stock price, if it opens up? And then second, you even agree with the premise that it help could actually get a lot of pressure because of their reporting cancellations?\nMichael Wortley: I got to slow you down just a second. So Anatol, do you pick that up?\nAnatol Feygin: I think I got a chunk of it. So, as Michael said, we get cancellation notice our obligation to deliver that cargo to the foundation customer is alleviated. It's part of your question if the CMI have the option to lift that cargo? The answer is, yes. That is not something that is very easy to do. We as you know, control a fairly sizable shipping portfolio, but that's steps down dramatically as of tomorrow once we hand over a Train 2 to those foundation customers. So it's possible given the volatility that we discussed with share that some bites of that apple emerge as market volatility plays out on both legs of that. But that's not going to be a huge number for us over the balance of the year.\nSpiro Dounis: Okay. Sorry, if I missed. It is most of me and I apologize, I was breaking up. The other part of that question was do you agree with the premise that that Henry Hub could actually be under a lot of pressure in June? Just given the fact that I think there's over reported 20 cancellations out there, which seems like a fairly large number on a daily basis. Just curious, the future is not reflecting that yet, but is that something that you see potentially happening?\nJack Fusco: Yes, if I knew the answer to that and what's priced in and what's anticipated at the John Arnold, not Anatol Feygin. So, it's, the market you said has a fair amount of the estimate and information. So, anybody's guess between the declines of associated gas production, how industrials come back. That balancing act is really what the market is trying to figure out. But if I was a gambling man, I'd say that at least some expectation of reduced flows LNG facilities is in the market already.\nSpiro Dounis: And then just second question, just around some of the economics of idling some of these trains and running less trains at a higher utilization rate, and it's not saying we're there yet, but just asking me in the context of these cancellations. Just curious, if that would make sense, what environment it would look, take to get there, and so they carry a high cost to sort of shut down and I start backup?\nMichael Wortley: Hey, it's Michael. We can run our trains at half rate sort of at the same efficiency as full rates basically. So that doesn't really affect us. As we looked at lifting economics, we make some money on lifting and lifting margin. But that's loss -- loss of that revenue is largely offset by the lower variable costs at the plant. So, we have fired outward costs. We paid a GE under the CSA, which we don't have to pay. We have trains are running and just other consumables, chemicals, refrigerants all of that. So, it's largely offset until we kind of -- it's a small headwind, but I don't think you'll notice it for us.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning team. And in fact, let me just pick it up where's fear lifted off? So just a high level first question, how you should think about ability to scale down OpEx and SG&A? And then thinking about that, A, in the context to press optimizing either the assets themselves in light of market conditions, I understand that's CMI. Obviously, the flexible piece within, how you would think about optimizing your assets? And then related to that SG&A, and as time goes on, given the market conditions as they stand, presumably there should be some latitude to ease up on margin potentially on some of the development dollars as well when we think about the cost side of the ledger?\nMichael Wortley: I think I caught that. We're looking at everything I would say, on the development side and some of the discretionary spending at the plant that's not part of Train 6 or Train 3. We've reworked those budgets and pushed out a couple hundred, if not several hundred million dollars in the next year just deferrals. I just talked about O&M, it's fairly inflexible. We got to keep our people in the plants ready to operate even in a lifting scenario. And as I said, our savings on variable cost offset the lifting margin that we forego when customers don't lift. So that's kind of a push. And then SG&A is a pretty small part of our overall cost structure.\nJack Fusco: And I was going to say that also. I mean there's only 1600 total employees and the whole Cheniere worldwide complex, so it's significantly different than I think the way other energy companies may have been talking about it. Our SG&A numbers are small. They're small expense overall. And they're going to continue to be smaller because a lot of our expenses from traveling around the world to negotiate contracts and visit our customers. And as we talked about earlier, none of that is going on and everything's been virtual and telecommuted. So -- but as Michael mentioned, we making sure we're running the business as effectively and efficiently as we possibly can.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. And just to do that point, and perhaps this poses in the scale of LNG you intend to deploy. You are thinking about optimizing use down the specific trains, given the conditions as we've scale. Could you reroute all of your operations to certain trains not operating others to bring down OpEx? I think and I'd imagine I'm not we're not quite there yet, if you will in terms of market conditions.\nMichael Wortley: No, we're not there yet in terms of market conditions, but you should rest assured that we are doing scenario planning with operations on every different configuration that you can imagine. And I, for one, like to keep the optionality available for CMI to make sure that we can respond quickly when or if this market turns around, but you should assume that we're doing all sorts of scenario planning.\nOperator: We'll go to our next question from Alonso Guerra-Garcia of Scotiabank.\nAlonso Guerra-Garcia: I guess starting off, obviously globally we're seeing countrywide shutdown both China's reemergence and the recent purchase of U.S. LNG cargoes for the first time in a year. Are you seeing more interest for you as LNG to China? I guess as far as them taking more cargoes this year or even potentially entering into new long-term agreements to Cheniere?\nAnatol Feygin: It's Anatol. Thanks for the question. As you said, it's been 13 months technically since China received a U.S. LNG cargo, so by definition, yes, there's more interests. And then April numbers preliminary are that China's up about 25% to 30% in terms of LNG imports. So, we fully expect to have more opportunities to transact and support our friends in China and continue to build our relationships there. As Jack said, in terms of long-term agreements and transactions, it's something that is not now goes to be done over the phone, especially with counterparties like that. So, we would need to have the opportunity to get back in front of people, and we fully expect to have a very attractive medium-to long-term offering. And as our competitive position continues to improve, we fully expect that to be a market that bears fruit for us in the not too distant future.\nAlonso Guerra-Garcia: And Anatol, this follow-up is probably for you, too. I think this is the first time, I believe that you have put out your expectations for FID as shown on Slide 9. I wonder, if you could share your assumptions or the criteria you use behind the projects you still have moving forward and also where you have stage three sitting in there?\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. So, we have a team, a cross functional team that evaluates these projects, as Michael mentioned in looking across the world at what else might be attractive, those kinds of economics and assessments are factored into that analysis. And we take all of the inputs that we have ourselves, as well as our friends that wouldn't have potent than others and incorporate them into what we think may make sense and what the dispatch curve of LNG looks like. That's how we make our informed decisions. So, we thought it's important to share that with you guys. You can see very similar numbers out of Woodmac and others. We have some more differences of opinion here and there. But they're not heretical by any means. And as I mentioned, over a 100 million tons have been deferred. That's not the delta you see in this 2021 number, because a lot of that 100 million tons, neither we nor others included in that dispatch to begin with. So, in terms of where Corpus Christi Stage 3 sits in there, I'll just say that, we continue to find it very attractive project. As Jack mentioned, we have this organic growth opportunities that leverage is a lot of our footprint and skill sets. And it is a project that we believe will be dispatched in that timeframe.\nOperator: And our last question that comes from Alex Kania of Wolfe Research.\nAlex Kania: Hi, good afternoon or morning. I guess just a question on marketing. Looking at kind of global net backs, is there is there a ability or willingness to do a lot of sort of third-party deals, maybe capture more local spot opportunities, kind of how big of that? Would that -- would you think is playing into the portfolio? And the second question is, again, just with perspective more uncertainty on the other U.S. interface LNG projects. I mean, is there an ability ultimately to maybe try to find a way to -- than can maybe capture that potential demand to be extent to those -- some of those contracts or projects are partially contracted? Is there may be potentially demand that been shift to some of your own projects.\nJack Fusco: Do want to go with the first one, Mike?\nMichael Wortley: Sure. I think this will be responsive to your question, but if not, please follow up. Again, we have a great team that is working remotely, but tirelessly. And there is volatility in shipping their volatility in local indices. And all of the teams in the LNG market globally remain very well engaged. And in the prompt market, there's fairly good liquidity and lots of opportunities to everybody -- for everybody to enter into optimizations. And we're taking advantage of those as the team's capture that. So, there's never a dull moment these days and some of that presents opportunities for us, if that's what you were asking.\nJack Fusco: And then part of that like I would say, yes. I mean, look, we offer bringing in products to our customers. We think we're going to come out of this pandemic stronger and we're going to try to capitalize on that.\nJack Fusco: Thank you and I want to thank all the participants. It was a record breaking number for us. It was over 945 participants this morning. We really appreciate the support and the interest of Cheniere Thank you all.\nOperator: This does conclude the call. We would like to thank everyone for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Jack, and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 9. We'll start with an overview of the global LNG markets during the first quarter, which was quite eventful before looking in more detail at ongoing trends in Europe and Asia. The LNG market continues to grow during the first quarter with output at a record level of almost a 100 million tons, about 10 million tons of new LNG supply were added in Q1, was about 70% coming from the U.S. This came on the heels of the approximately 40 million tons of new LNG supply in 2019. While some new trains started up in the first quarter, Cameron Train 2 and two units at Elba, much of the capacity added last year is also now fully ramped up and contributing to higher supply. The continued supply surge entered an already amply supplied global market, which is now also trying to cope with the pandemic. The coronavirus affected several LNG importing countries sequentially during the first quarter. It temporarily reduced demand for LNG in China and will ultimately impact demand in other countries in similar ways. Amid reports of lockdowns and delays in cargo deliveries in China, the year-on-year reduction in imports was relatively benign at less than 1 million tons in Q1. However, the total impact on demand in Europe and South Asian countries is still uncertain. We observed a quick recovery in China in March and return to demand growth in the JKT area during the quarter led by South Korea and Taiwan. We also observed a marked increase in demand in South Asian markets as a result of attractive price levels with India leading the charge during the quarter. In total, Asia's LNG imports increased 7% or over 4 million tons year-on-year. Meanwhile, Europe continue to import record quantities of LNG 25% higher year-on-year as supply growth provided ample residual LNG to flow to Europe. Europe absorbed most of the quarterly incremental LNG deliveries from the U.S., while flows to Asia remain flat quarter-on-quarter. U.S. deliveries to Europe increased more than 40% quarter-on-quarter to over 8 million tons during Q1. These LNG supply and demand dynamics, the coronavirus and a precipitous drop in oil prices since early March, have continued to exert pressure on global gas prices. TTF average $3.35 during the first quarter, over 50% lower year-on-year. Similarly, JKM averaged 482 in Q1 more than 40% lower than the first quarter of 2019. After a $58 a barrel settlement in March, Brent futures tumbled to below $25 in the days following a lack of agreement by OPEC+ on March 6th. Henry Hub's March contract settled at $1.82, significantly lower than the $2.86 March 2019 settlement. This confluence of various factors and uncertainty about economic growth has led many companies to rationalize capital spend, and for several developers to reconsider the viability of their planned LNG projects, both domestically and abroad. We've already seen announcements of FID delays and cancellations from projects totaling over 100 million tons per annum of capacity. The chart on the far right of this slide shows our perspective on projects thought to be most likely to reach FID in 2020 and '21.In early 2019, we expect the projects totaling approximately 100 million tons per annum of capacity to have a reasonable chance of FID in 2020, and another 30 million tons of capacity in 2021. After the demand and supply shocks, which began during the first quarter, we anticipate that FIDs in 2020 will be much lower totaling under 15 million tons per annum of capacity, with some projects shifting to the 2021 FID and others delayed even further. We now expect up FIDs for the two year periods to total approximately 65 million tons are about half of our previous forecast. Supply and demand dynamics are tightening the competitive landscape driving some LNG projects with higher breakeven thresholds out of the probable FID stack. We do include our Corpus Christi Stage 3 expansion in these expected FIDs which will be dependent upon, among other things, obtaining sufficient commercial agreements to support the project. We remain confident in our competitive position and ability to leverage existing infrastructure and other competitive advantages to provide cost effective supplies to the market to satisfy growing long term LNG demand. Please turn to Slide 10 to review the European market in more detail. I mentioned earlier the tough market conditions through the first quarter led to record levels of U.S. LNG flowing into Europe. Over 55% of U.S. LNG deliveries in the first quarter are over 8 million tons flow to Europe. In total, over 27 million tons of LNG landed in Europe during the quarter, an increase of approximately 25% year-on-year. The growth in LNG imports was partially accommodated by year-on-year declines in indigenous gas production and lower imports from pipeline gas. Pipeline gas flows declined by about 6 Bcf a day during the quarter equivalent to approximately 165 LNG cargoes. However, power generation from wind, solar and other renewables was up approximately 20% year-on-year in Q1 keeping some pressure on European stores inventories, which in the absence of a cold winter retain their surplus, ending March over 0.5 trillion cubic feet higher than the prior year. While it remains too early to gauge and isolate the impact of the coronavirus on European balances, we're seeing its impact on overall gas demand in some of the continent's major gas markets, as gas demand in Europe, six main gas markets declined year-on-year in Q1. However, longer term, we continue to be constructive on gas demand in Europe as the energy landscape changes due to the region's decarbonization goals. Countries in Europe plan to either retire, decommission and/or cut approximately 100 gigawatts of coal and nuclear capacity in aggregate by 2030. We believe that gas will be an important part of the transition away from solid fuels and will continue to play a role in ensuring Europe is in a good position to manage grid reliability needs. Please turn from Slide 11 to look at LNG market dynamics in Asia. Despite the coronavirus pandemic, LNG imports in Asia increased by about 7% year-on-year to 68 million tons in the first quarter. While this growth is not insignificant, the demand response to lower LNG prices would have likely been more pronounced, if not for the impact of the virus. Soft prices along domestic infrastructure, the bottlenecking a lot of price sensitive buyers in South and Southeast Asia to offer support to the market, when Chinese demand was soft. However, as we've seen in China, lockdowns and the resulting the flying and economic activity could place a limit on demand growth in the coming months. Strict virus containment measures resulted in a steep economic contraction in China in February. This resulted in reduced imports of LNG and central Asian gas by 0.9 million tons and half a Bcf a day respectively, year-on-year. However, as most large industrial enterprises resumed work across the nation, Chinese LNG imports started recovering in March. In the JKT region, a year long decline and imports was reversed as both South Korea and Taiwan continues to take a tough stance on Colburn offering support to gas fired power generation demand. South Korea has mandated maintenance could coal plants decreased coal fired power generation in January and February by 15% versus last year. And Taiwan's coal fired power generation dropped 4.5% year-on-yea. In Japan weak power demand and mild temperatures reduce the need for LNG imports, despite lower nuclear availability compared to last year. In the coming few months, we do expect three nuclear reactors to go offline as a result of not meeting antiterrorism requirements. In addition to the Sendai number one nuclear reactor that was taken offline recently. These outages are expected to offer some upside for LNG demand in the coming weeks and months. Fundamentally, we could also see upside to LND demand as a result of various stimulus packages that are being rolled out. In China for example, several provinces announced 2020 infrastructure expansion plans as the nation reopens the economy. Some of these plans include LNG, we gasification projects and gas fired power generation projects, which would contribute more firmly to expectations of China to double his current gas fired power generation fleet by 2030. China's gas fired power capacity is expected to reach 200 gigawatts in the coming decade more than doubling from about 90 gigawatts currently. as a country seeks to reach peak CO2 emissions by 2030. To conclude, the market is currently experiencing extremely unusual conditions that are hurting bearish pressures across the entire commodity complex. Guest stories levels in Europe were high, costs prices there are likely to remain weak until stories levels normalized. Well, the demand impact of the coronavirus remains uncertain in the near-term. We expect that many concerns will be alleviated in the coming months as the world recovers from the pandemic, lockdowns are lifted and economic activity resumed. Looking beyond the current market events, we believe that long-term fundamentals have not changed and that LNG remains a reliable, competitive and flexible solution for the energy needs of both Asia and Europe. And finally, we believe that the current market and economic conditions, although challenging and improving our competitive position over the medium to longer term. Thank you for your time and attention. I'll now turn the call over to Michael. Good morning, Shneur, and thanks for the question. Obviously, we've had a large decline and we think we'll continue to see a decline in oil directed drilling activity that will have an effect on associated gas production. We think that over the medium term that will be modest, and as prices normalize in North America, you've already seen the big response in Cal 21 trading over $2.70 will be very attractive for gas directed drilling and the production that will come from that. We obviously are at the very tail end in terms of the infrastructure build out for Phase 1 of LNG facilities. So that large demand driver will have and we fully expect to see a relatively stable NYMEX going forward between $2.5 and $3 is where the curves are today. Even in these unprecedented times, I'll just point out that the volatility -- realized volatility on NYMEX has been substantially lower than on crude or even JKM. And we do expect that, that North American gas production and pricing will be attractive relative to global levels and the opportunity over the medium to longer term to safely reliably and economically supply our customers will be very attractive. Sure. To the first part of your question, NYMEX has been less volatile, but all sides as you know have been quite volatile and just want to thank the teams that we haven't seen in a couple months, but talk through on a regular basis for their tireless efforts in that, taking advantage of some of those opportunities. So, no one is sitting on their hands, and as market opportunities present themselves as you would expect, Cheniere marketing is taking advantage of those, but clearly we won't give you any specific details around that. Thanks Jack. Just, Jeremy said on top of that, as you know, we have obviously very good relationships with our now 20-ish or so counterparties, they value the flexibility in these contracts too to cancel. They give us substantial notice and as Jack said, the coordination between all of the functions including our gas procurement team and that notice has been exceptional. And the teams haven't missed a beat, and our customers are appreciative and obviously respectful of those notices, so far so good. Thank you. Thanks Michael. Obviously, we can't comment on others and what's embedded in the SPAs. But clearly there has to be some ability to vanish some kind of a relief valve. In our case it is it is those cancellations in other cases where there are fixed volumes to fixed destinations other tools apply. And it's not surprising that, that FM is a path to manage that exposure. I can't obviously comment on anyone in particular. But clearly, the FOB SPA is a very different animal than something you would traditionally see that has a lot less flexibility embedded. Hey Christine, it's Anatol. So in terms of... I think I got a chunk of it. So, as Michael said, we get cancellation notice our obligation to deliver that cargo to the foundation customer is alleviated. It's part of your question if the CMI have the option to lift that cargo? The answer is, yes. That is not something that is very easy to do. We as you know, control a fairly sizable shipping portfolio, but that's steps down dramatically as of tomorrow once we hand over a Train 2 to those foundation customers. So it's possible given the volatility that we discussed with share that some bites of that apple emerge as market volatility plays out on both legs of that. But that's not going to be a huge number for us over the balance of the year. It's Anatol. Thanks for the question. As you said, it's been 13 months technically since China received a U.S. LNG cargo, so by definition, yes, there's more interests. And then April numbers preliminary are that China's up about 25% to 30% in terms of LNG imports. So, we fully expect to have more opportunities to transact and support our friends in China and continue to build our relationships there. As Jack said, in terms of long-term agreements and transactions, it's something that is not now goes to be done over the phone, especially with counterparties like that. So, we would need to have the opportunity to get back in front of people, and we fully expect to have a very attractive medium-to long-term offering. And as our competitive position continues to improve, we fully expect that to be a market that bears fruit for us in the not too distant future. Yes. So, we have a team, a cross functional team that evaluates these projects, as Michael mentioned in looking across the world at what else might be attractive, those kinds of economics and assessments are factored into that analysis. And we take all of the inputs that we have ourselves, as well as our friends that wouldn't have potent than others and incorporate them into what we think may make sense and what the dispatch curve of LNG looks like.

            "name": "Jack Fusco",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today in downtown Huston to review our results from the first quarter of 2020. While, we usually host these earnings calls with a room full of executives and an office building full of employees, today, it's just the four of us in a large conference room as we're complying with the CDC recommended guidelines and our headquarter professionals are telecommuting. The first quarter of 2020 was a historic period and the global outbreak of COVID-19 has impacted our personal and professional lives in many ways. Our daily routines from commuting to work, educating our children, interfacing with colleagues, to visiting with friends and family, and everything in between has been offended, and we've all been forced to embrace a new reality. Watching this pandemic spread with lethal force across the globe has been an unbelievable experience, likewise, the response for stop the spread and focus on ultimately finding a solution to eradicate this virus has been unprecedented. I want to personally thank all of the medical professionals, who care for us in the first responders to test us, feed us, and provide for our safety for their tireless efforts, and we pray for their good health. Turning now to Slide 5. As Cheniere, we have built a strong resilient customer focused business, which is capable of weathering volatility in both the energy and financial markets. While skeptics may question this at time, we find ourselves in this historic volatility and uncertainty in both of these markets and the resilience of our business model is on full display. For the first quarter of 2020, we generated a record amount of consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $1.04 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately 250 million on revenues of $2.7 billion, and we generate a net income attributable to common stockholders of $375 million. Despite both supply and demand driven near-term weakness in the LNG market, I am pleased today to reconfirm our 2020 full year guidance ranges of $3.8 to $4.1 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion of distributable cash flow. The highly contracted nature of our business, the proactive risk management of our market exposure and our maniacal focus on operational excellence are key enablers of these results in a weak market environment. Our first quarter financial results and the reconfirmation of our full year 2020 guidance are testament to the resilience of our operational, contractual and financial foundations. We repurchased a $155 million of stock under a repurchase program during the quarter, and as we disclosed in our previous earnings call, we paid down $300 million of the CCH HoldCo convertible notes with cash. Michael will address our financial results in guidance and more detail in a few minutes. During the first quarter, we produced an export at 128 cargoes of LNG, including 100 cargo from Corpus Christi and the thousands of cumulative cargo. Since the start up of operations, we have produced and exported more than 75 million tons of LNG from our projects, which has reached 35 countries and regions worldwide. Looking ahead, the long-term SPAs tied to train to our Corpus Christi are set to commence tomorrow. We have been in the process of on-boarding those customers and we welcome them to the Cheniere complex. Instruction on Corpus Christi Train 3 and being past Train 6 continue to progress on accelerated schedules. Corpus Christi Train 3 is approximately 84% project completion. It's being past Train 6 is around 54% project completion. And both Trains are forecast to be significantly ahead of their guaranteed completion dates. Now turn to Slide 6, where I will spend a few moments describing Cheniere response to COVID-19 as it has been significant. We recognize the rest of COVID-19 and began implementing response measures early prior to many government imposed requirements. We have activated various emergency response teams including an executive management team and business support team, and a site management team. All of whom are focused on employee safety and welfare business continuity and maintaining operations at our liquefaction sites. These teams monitor status, develop and implement policies and protocols specific each office, location and site. In addition, they enforced protective measures. And most importantly regularly communicate with all the relevant personnel. In early March, we began consulting with a medical advisor and implemented social distancing to revise shift schedules, isolating work groups, work from home policies and restricted non-essential business travel, just to mention a few proactive items. In addition, we instituted minimum staffing levels at our sites, isolated our critical operating personnel, and began utilizing temporary onsite housing for our workforce at our sites. I'm extremely grateful and proud of our employees and their performance throughout this pandemic. On the engineering and construction side, we and our EPC partner, Bechtel, have implemented significant safety and emergency response protocols at both Sabine Pass in Corpus Christi to ensure workplace safety and business continuity. We've implemented many changes at the sites and pursuit of these priorities. That said we do not currently expect these measures or COVID-19 have a material impact on our project cost or schedule for either Corpus Christi Train 3 or Sabine Pass Train 6. I applaud our engineering and construction team and the Bechtel group for their swift and effective implementation of these protocols to ensure a flawless execution. The impact of COVID-19 to our country communities in those countries of our foundation customers has been unprecedented. As a company, community involvement and paying it forward is in our DNA. To-day, Cheniere has pledged over a million dollars to global COVID-19 release efforts. Our commitments and contributions are focused on the communities where we live and work Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Washington, D.C., London, Singapore and China. We're proud to do our part during this global outbreak to help reduce the food insecurity for those most in need and provide provisions and equipment for first responders and frontline healthcare workers. I'm extremely proud of our success of the personal protective equipment drive and partnership with Houston, the Astros Foundation and Project Care. Now turn to Slide 7, before the call over to Anatol, I want to quickly discuss certain aspects of our long-term contracts. In the wake of the dislocations we've seen in both the financial and energy markets over these last few weeks, we've received countless investor inquiries regarding our long-term contracts. First, regarding our contract sanctity, I remind you that our long-term contracts do not include provisions for renegotiations. We intend to meet all of our contractual obligations, and in return, we expect our customers to do the same. Second, regarding cargo lifting elections, as I mentioned on our call in February, we won't make it a practice describe the details of ordinary interactions with our customers to the market, including their decisions regarding lifting of cargoes. But as you all know, one of the primary flexibilities granted to our long-term customers within their contracts is their right to cancel or suspend cargoes with appropriate notice. In instances where that occur, the fixed liquefaction fee is still paid to us and our marketing is selling as the option to market the volume into the global marketplace. As global markets remain weak, we have had customers elect to cancel some additional cargoes. We won't quantify the amount, but we reiterate that our customers value the flexibility inherent in the contract structure and our visibility to achieving our financial guidance for the year is unchanged. Similarly regarding speculation and confusion around force majeure or FM, which we addressed in our prior call as well, FM clauses in our FOB contracts specifically exclude such events as the unavailability of or any event affecting downstream LNG facilities, changes in the customer's market factors or other commercial, financial or economic conditions. As such, depressed gas prices globally or economic fallout or decrease gas demand from COVID-19 do not provide a valid legal basis on which a counterpart can claim FM. And now, I'll turn the call over to Anatol, who will provide an update on the LNG market. Well thank you. Thanks for the question. I think we'll have Anatol address a long-term, his view over the long term gas market. Jeremy, this is Jack. Thanks for the question and thanks for your support and involvement here at Cheniere. I just have to say, I'm extremely proud of the organization. Our ability even when we're separated to communicate and coordinate has been fantastic. Their ability to actually assemble during the, prior to the pandemic and put policies and procedures in place to ensure that our employees were safe and that our business continuity continued has been incredible. Randy gave you some nice pictures in the slides of the camps. I'm so grateful for the employees that we're willing to sacrificing with her families to live in those camps and ensure that our operations were stable. So I would say that, it's an unprecedented time, as Anatol said, it's extremely volatile out there. Our customers still need gas. We're hopeful for the day when industrial and commercial demand can you come back into the worldwide market. And hopefully, we're seeing some signs of green shoots there, but no, there's been no surprises. Now, I think we'd like our position. Last November when we gave you all guidance, I told you we were materially hedge for the year prior. You should expect us to manage the business conservatively and not want to take a lot of market risk. And I have complete confidence when we convert that market risk to operating risk and my operating staff will be ready willing and able to provide. So, I don't want to get into our book or the market. Liquidity in this market, it's been a little bit rough these days, as you can imagine. So, Michael, as you know, I'm relatively young in this industry. So, I'll take the first part of it, and I'll hand it over to Anatol to help with a more longer term on some of the other SPAs that you highlighted. We feel very comfortable with our customer base and with our SPAs that our customers have been given the flexibility to cancel the cargoes with as Anatol said long term notice, and lets us plan around what we need to do. It gives them a good option, they value that option. And we're seeing them utilize it the way they would utilize it. We don't see the risk of FM portfolio for Cheniere. As far as other entity other projects, I'll let Anatol to address that part. Michael, we have a not enough organic growth to satisfy our needs for many, many years to come both at Corpus Christi and at Sabine Pass. And we have the existing infrastructure there. And as you mentioned, we already have permitted expansions at Corpus that we're ready, willing and able to do. I think, the first thing I would need to see is the airlines open back up. And that's to be able to travel. These are associations for long-term energy contracts that require a face-to-face combat, for lack of a better word. I mean you have to get close to the customer and look each other in the eye and for the foreseeable future now, or at least initially that looks like it's a little ways away for us. But I don't know, Michael, do you have anything to add. If I could first, Christine, are you not asking me to give you quarterly guidance, are you on this call? So, as you know the plant, Sabine especially has a little bit of seasonality from the standpoint of production. In terms of the SPAs, they are fundamental ratable, but we do have some additional volumes that are, in accordance with the SPAs that are that are winter loaded. So you do have -- in terms of the SPAs, you have a little bit more contractual third-party sales in the winter. And in terms of plant production, you have a little bit more, but it's not very meaningful across the year. The big step function change of course, as you know, is the May 1 DFCDs of Corpus Train 2. So in terms of SPA'ed volume if you will, as of May 1, there's another step function change to get our full 7 train platform contracted. Let's start first one first, the NGPL force majeure from the lightning storm that blew through two nights ago. Yes, if I knew the answer to that and what's priced in and what's anticipated at the John Arnold, not Anatol Feygin. So, it's, the market you said has a fair amount of the estimate and information. So, anybody's guess between the declines of associated gas production, how industrials come back. That balancing act is really what the market is trying to figure out. But if I was a gambling man, I'd say that at least some expectation of reduced flows LNG facilities is in the market already. And I was going to say that also. I mean there's only 1600 total employees and the whole Cheniere worldwide complex, so it's significantly different than I think the way other energy companies may have been talking about it. Our SG&A numbers are small. They're small expense overall. And they're going to continue to be smaller because a lot of our expenses from traveling around the world to negotiate contracts and visit our customers. And as we talked about earlier, none of that is going on and everything's been virtual and telecommuted. So -- but as Michael mentioned, we making sure we're running the business as effectively and efficiently as we possibly can. Do want to go with the first one, Mike? And then part of that like I would say, yes. I mean, look, we offer bringing in products to our customers. We think we're going to come out of this pandemic stronger and we're going to try to capitalize on that. Thank you and I want to thank all the participants. It was a record breaking number for us. It was over 945 participants this morning. We really appreciate the support and the interest of Cheniere Thank you all."

            "name": "Michael Wortley",
            "content": "Thanks, Anatole, and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 13. For the first quarter, we generated net income of 375 million consolidated adjusted EBITDA of 1.04 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately 250 million. We explored 453 TBtu of LNG or 128 cargoes from our liquefaction projects during the first quarter. LNG production levels were relatively flat as compared to fourth quarter 2019. For first quarter, we recognized an income 459 TBtu to LNG produced that our liquefaction projects and 14 TBtu of LNG source from third parties. Approximately 79% of the 473 Tbtu of LNG recognized and income during the first quarter was sold under either long-term SPA or IPM agreements, and the remaining 21% was sold by our marketing affiliates, either into the spot market or under short and medium term contracts. Volume sold under SPAs or IPM agreements increased by approximately 20 Tbtu compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, driven primarily by seasonality of volumes under certain SPA, and by the commencement of our IPM arrangements with EOG which occurred in January. Income from operations for the first quarter was approximately $1.3 billion, an increase of over $300 million compared to the fourth quarter. This increase was primarily due to increased net mark to market gains from changes in fair value of commodity derivatives. Income from operations for the first quarter also includes revenues of approximately $50 million associated with cancelled LNG cargoes, which recognized upon notice of cancellation. Volumes of LNG recognized and income are materially consistent for the first quarter as compared to fourth quarter 2019 and realize margins per MMbtu of LNG decreased only slightly approximately 2% quarter-over-quarter. Net income attributable to common stockholders for the first quarter was $375 million, or $1.48 per share basic and $1.43 per share diluted, a decrease of over $500 million for fourth quarter 2019. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2019 was positively impacted my Tax Valuation allowance release of over $500 million, which did not occur in the first quarter. Net income for the first quarter also decreased as compared to the fourth quarter 2019 due to losses on derivatives related to our interest rate swaps partially offset by increased operating income. During the first quarter, we repurchased an aggregate of 2.9 million shares of common stock for a total of $155 million under our share repurchase program. As of the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $600 million of remaining capacity under the share repurchase program. Additionally, as we disclosed on a previous earnings call, in March, we amended the note purchase agreement for the Corpus Christi HoldCo convertible notes, enabling us to pay down $300 million of the outstanding balance of cash and allowing us the option to pay down the remaining outstanding balance in cash until September. This transaction reduced our total notional debt and prevented equity dilution of over 6 million shares. Turn now to Slide 14. Liquidity and financing related questions have been central topics among our investor base recently and understandably so, given recent disruptions in the global financial and energy markets. Cheniere is in a strong financial position with more than adequate liquidity, strong cash flow generation capability for the remainder of this year and into future years, and multiple options to address our upcoming debt maturities, the earliest of which doesn't occur until next year. We had approximately $4 billion of liquidity available for general corporate purposes as of the end of the first quarter, including cash on hand and undrawn balances under the working capital facilities and revolvers across our structure. In March, SPL entered into a new $1.2 billion working capital facility, which effectively refinance the prior working capital facility, lowered the interest rate, improve flexibility under certain covenants, and pushed out the maturity date from 2020 to 2025. The undrawn capacity under this facility, as well as under the CQP revolver, Corpus working capital facility, and parent level revolver provides a liquidity backstop should one become necessary. That said, we do not anticipate the need to draw on our facilities as a result of recent market conditions. Additionally, we do not currently have any concerns regarding our ability to comply with our debt covenants. We do not any external financing needs for the completion of construction of Corpus Train 3 or Sabine Pass Train 3. Those trains were financed approximately 50-50 debt equity and the debt financing of both Trains have been completed. Remaining equity commitments are expected to be funded using cash on hand and cash flow generated through the completion of construction. The nearest term debt maturity across our corporate structure is the 2 billion outstanding SBL 2021 notes, which mature in February of next year. Our team has been working on addressing that maturity since before we sent market disruptions. And as we have said previously, we expect to use some combination of both SBL and the investment grade market and CQP in the high yield market to refinance these notes. Sizing and timing of course will be dependent upon bond market conditions which located in March, but a since stabilized considerably. Also in 2021 at the LNG level, we have approximately 1.4 billion of outstanding convertible notes, which mature in May and have a conversion share price of approximately $94. As with the SBL bonds, we began strategizing on addressing these converts earlier this year and are evaluating options to redeem those notes including refinancing options. It's too early in the process to discuss specifics, but we expect to add multiple options to redeem or refinance these convertible notes. We're also considering financing options to redeem the remaining outstanding balance as a Corpus Christi HoldCo convertible notes due 2025 I mentioned a moment ago depending on market conditions. Jack mentioned despite headwinds and weakness in the global LNG market, remain confident in our ability to generate financial results within our guidance ranges this year, and today we are reconfirming our 2024 full year guidance. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA of 3.8 billion to 4.1 billion and distributable cash flow of 1 billion to 1.3 billion. So, we continue to track to the lower end of the EBITDA guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF guidance exclude the impact of one-time costs associated with our COVID-19 response efforts that Jack summarized. As we mentioned on the last call, we have pre-sold the large majority over 95% or LNG production for 2020, leaving our financial results less exposed to fluctuations in market pricing this year. Since the last call, we continued to put away unsold volumes for the remainder of 2020 and today a $1 move in market margin would result in approximately $60 million change in consolidated adjusted EBITDA, with that sensitivity weighted to the upside given today's market margins. With regard to capital allocation for the balance of the year, we designed the capital allocation framework to provide us with flexibility. With both energy markets and financial markets recently dislocating and considering the debt and convert maturities next year, I just discussed, we'll likely take advantage of that flexibility and take a more conservative approach with respect to our capital allocation decisions, at least until those markets stabilized and visibility improves. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions. Yes, it's Michael. I'll take the second question and then let Anatol handle the first one. But as we said, we have two maturities, the SPL maturity. And we have no maturity this year, but the first one is in February of next year. If you look at SPL complex that entire market -- that entire complex is above par and trading well below 5%. So, that market is we think certainly open to us and we'll deal with that sometime over the balance of the year. In terms of CEI, we're working on several options to deal with that convert, which, again, is not until the summer of next year. But as I said in the prepared remarks, we've been thinking about that already. And I think some combination of the bank market, the bond market, current liquidity and prospective cash flow, or some combination thereof will allow us to deal with those converts. So, I wouldn't speak specifically is the convert market open to us. I mean, we're looking at a lot a lot of options. I'm fairly certain the bang market is open to us. It's just a question of quantum. And so, we're working through that right now to deal with that convert in the summer next year. And ideally, if we can get the right quantum to go ahead and deal with the EIG notes of Corpus Christi HoldCo to which aren't pending maturity, but it is highest cost paper in the complex. So, we'll see how that plays out here over the coming months and be pretty proactive in picking some combination of those alternatives to sort that out. I mean, we have a team that kind of spends a lot of time looking at what's going on around us and around the world, and we've looked at a lot of things. But as Jack said, everything's got to come back and compete with our own organic projects, not only economically, but from an execution standpoint and certainty of execution. I've not really found anything that was any better than what we have. So, I would just echo Jack sentiments in that regard. That's right. So, the accounting rules say that, when our obligations are satisfied under the contract, we recognize the revenue. The payment terms are still the same. We don't get paid until we booked the revenue because we have no other obligations on a contract once we get the cancellation notice. So, that's right. Yes, you got it. I mean, to the extent it swaps over into the next quarter, we're recognizing it in the current quarter, so... That's right. Non-H2O has already been lifted, and I callously did say a couple of responses that pipelines use FM like popping tick takes. So, it's a blunt instrument that, that they have which has not been and we don't expect to be an issue for us. Yes, Q2 forward for Train 3 is about $600 million largely spent this year that's before contingency, so maybe a little bit more depending on how that plays out. And SPL is about 1.4 billion, SPL Train 6 1.4 really through 20, 30 at this point again, excluding contingency. Well, I mean we just effectively -- margins were low, right. So at some point, we have a stop loss and we don't lift. So that's why I faced the metric and its 30 million to the downside and 60 million to the upside. So, yes, I mean, we won't miss our guidance range because of marketing. I think that's a fair statement. I got to slow you down just a second. So Anatol, do you pick that up? Hey, it's Michael. We can run our trains at half rate sort of at the same efficiency as full rates basically. So that doesn't really affect us. As we looked at lifting economics, we make some money on lifting and lifting margin. But that's loss -- loss of that revenue is largely offset by the lower variable costs at the plant. So, we have fired outward costs. We paid a GE under the CSA, which we don't have to pay. We have trains are running and just other consumables, chemicals, refrigerants all of that. So, it's largely offset until we kind of -- it's a small headwind, but I don't think you'll notice it for us. I think I caught that. We're looking at everything I would say, on the development side and some of the discretionary spending at the plant that's not part of Train 6 or Train 3. We've reworked those budgets and pushed out a couple hundred, if not several hundred million dollars in the next year just deferrals. I just talked about O&M, it's fairly inflexible. We got to keep our people in the plants ready to operate even in a lifting scenario. And as I said, our savings on variable cost offset the lifting margin that we forego when customers don't lift. So that's kind of a push. And then SG&A is a pretty small part of our overall cost structure. No, we're not there yet in terms of market conditions, but you should rest assured that we are doing scenario planning with operations on every different configuration that you can imagine. And I, for one, like to keep the optionality available for CMI to make sure that we can respond quickly when or if this market turns around, but you should assume that we're doing all sorts of scenario planning. Sure. I think this will be responsive to your question, but if not, please follow up. Again, we have a great team that is working remotely, but tirelessly. And there is volatility in shipping their volatility in local indices. And all of the teams in the LNG market globally remain very well engaged. And in the prompt market, there's fairly good liquidity and lots of opportunities to everybody -- for everybody to enter into optimizations. And we're taking advantage of those as the team's capture that. So, there's never a dull moment these days and some of that presents opportunities for us, if that's what you were asking."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Randy Bhatia. Please go ahead.\nRandy Bhatia: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Cheniere's fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings conference call.  The slide presentation and access to the webcast for today's call are available at cheniere.com. Joining me this morning are Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO; Anatol Feygin, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Zach Davis, Executive Vice President and CFO.  Before we begin, I would like to remind all listeners that our remarks, including answers to your questions, may contain forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from what is described in these statements. Slide 2 of our presentation contains a discussion of those forward-looking statements and associated risks.  In addition, we may include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the appendix to the slide presentation.  As part of our discussion of Cheniere's results, today's call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP, or CQP. We do not intend to cover CQP's results separately from those of Cheniere Energy, Inc.  The call agenda is shown on Slide 3. Jack will begin with operating and financial highlights. Anatol will then provide an update on the LNG market, and Zach will review our financial results and guidance. After prepared remarks, we will open the call to Q&A.  I'll now turn the call over to Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO.\nJack Fusco: Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today, and thank you for your continued support of Cheniere. I'm pleased to be here this morning to review our 2021 results and successes, discuss our improved 2022 outlook and share my excitement about Cheniere's future.  2021 was a transformative year for Cheniere. First, we completed the construction of our initial 9 train platform and increased our run rate production to 45 million tons per annum. Second, we reached a meaningful cash flow inflection point. And third, we successfully executed a variety of long-term contracts to put Stage 3 on a path to FID this year. And the contract with EOG we announced this morning effectively completes the commercialization of Stage 3.  While 2020 proved our resilience, 2021 showcased the power of the Cheniere platform. The many competitive advantages I've discussed on these calls over the past -- close to 6 years were on full display throughout the year, each contributing to the results and the increased 2022 guidance we are providing this morning.  We begin 2022 in an extremely supportive LNG market environment, the extended period of volatility and elevated prices driven by an underinvestment in infrastructure and geopolitical tensions underscore the vital need for reliable, affordable, secure and environmentally competitive energy supplies on a long-term basis.  Please turn to Slide 5, where I will review key operational and financial highlights from the quarter and the year and introduce our upwardly revised guidance. For the fourth quarter of 2021, we generated a consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $540 million on revenue of approximately $6.6 billion. We exported a record 153 cargoes during the quarter, bringing our 2021 annual total to 566 cargoes of LNG shipped. We have now exported over 2,000 cargoes to 37 countries and regions around the world.  Throughout the year, we repeatedly raised full year EBITDA and DCF guidance after announcing the initial ranges in November of 2020, ultimately raising EBITDA and DCF guidance by $700 million and $600 million, respectively. And I'm pleased to report today that we delivered on the increased guidance, generating approximately $4.9 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $2 billion in distributable cash flow for the full year 2021. Today, we are raising full year 2022 guidance to $7 billion to $7.5 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $4.3 billion to $4.8 billion in DCF. This significant guidance increase is driven primarily by 3 factors: first, the earlier than forecast substantial completion of Train 6, which occurred in early February of this year; second, the further improvement in market margins since our November earnings call; and third, the timing of some cargoes that were shipped around year-end 2021, a variable which we mentioned last November.  In addition, we are raising our 2022 CQP distribution guidance range to $4 to $4.25 per unit and introducing a revised distribution plan. Today at CQP, we announced the initiation of a quarterly distributions to be comprised of a base amount, plus a variable amount, which we are expected to begin with the distribution with respect to the first quarter of 2022.  This distribution approach enables a more efficient distribution of CQP's cash, which is warranted given the completion of Train 6. Zach will cover the financial results and guidance updates in more detail in a few minutes. But clearly, we expect to build upon our success in 2021 and have an even better 2022.  Turn to Slide 6, where we'll take a victory lap on a transformative 2021. During the fourth quarter, our commercial momentum continued as we signed long-term SBAs with Sinochem and Foran, which built upon the long-term agreements we signed earlier in the year with Tourmaline, ENN and Glencore, and brought our aggregate long-term commercial volumes signed in 2021 to approximately 80 million tons equivalent and over $11 billion of fixed fees over the next 20 years or so. Both SPAs with Sinochem and Foran feature early or bridging volumes, further reinforcing the value of our tailored solutions in the market.  Our commercial success in 2021, coupled with the continued momentum demonstrated by the EOG agreement we just announced, as well as recent market dynamics, has brought Stage 3 even more into focus, and we remain confident in a midyear FID. I'll speak more about Stage 3 in a few minutes.  The excellent financial performance has enabled us to accelerate the execution of our comprehensive all-of-the-above capital allocation strategy announced in September. For the full year, we exceeded our goal of $1 billion of debt pay down by $200 million. And in 2022, we are already off to a fast start on debt reduction and expect to be able to significantly outperform the $1 billion target this year.  Additionally, we paid our first ever quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter of 2021, and we repurchased over 100,000 shares of LNG stock since we resumed share repurchases last year.  And of course, on execution, we continue to reinforce our market-leading reputation and track record on reliability, which has never been more important given the market's recent volatility and the critical need for energy security across the globe.  Substantial completion was declared on Corpus Christi Train 3 in the first quarter of 2021, and we just announced substantial completion on Sabine Pass Train 6 earlier this month. With the addition of these 2 trains, we have now completed our initial 9-train platform safely, ahead of schedule and on budget. We now process over 7 Bcf per day or approximately 7% of the total gas production in the U.S., and we do so every day with near perfect scheduling efficiency.  Finally, and more importantly, our safety metrics improved year-over-year in an especially impressive feat, considering we were commissioning and completing trains at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi during the year. Safety is the foundation of our success, and I'm proud that our continued focus on safety and operational excellence continues to yield tangible benefits for all Cheniere stakeholders.  Turning now to Slide 7. As I usually do on these year-end calls, I'd like to lay out some of my key goals for the Cheniere team to accomplish in 2022. This is not an exhaustive list of what I expect us to achieve this year, as the team in this room will certainly attest, but I wanted to highlight some of my top priorities for the year.  First and foremost, we intend to deliver on the upwardly revised financial guidance we provided this morning. We are excited about our significantly improved outlook for the year. Energy markets remain volatile, but we have a high degree of visibility into our ability to deliver results within the ranges provided given how we manage our exposure to the market.  Second, to get our Corpus Christi Stage 3 project to FID, Corpus Christi Stage 3 is a very competitive expansion project, which meets our financially disciplined growth, capital investment parameters and achieve the kind of accretive growth we target as part of our long-term capital allocation plan.  As I said a moment ago, the project is well positioned to be sanctioned, and it is fair to describe our remaining steps to FID as dotting our Is and crossing our Ts. We are working closely with Bechtel to finalize EPC contract and expect to conclude that soon.  We had great success in getting Corpus Christi Train 3 and Sabine Pass Train 6 underway with limited notices to proceed, or LNTPs, which derisked the projects and got them ahead of schedule early. We would look to do the same on Stage 3, so that's something that could happen in the near term as we progress towards a full FID and full NTP on all 7 trains sometime this summer.  On the commercial front, we are now working to finalize the contract portfolio for Stage 3, both in regard to potentially new long-term agreement as well as with existing agreements at CMI. The enhanced EOG-IPM agreement effectively completes the required commercialization support for Stage 3.  In addition, we have recently assigned the ENN and Glencore SPAs from CMI to Sabine Pass and expect to further optimize CMI's long-term contract portfolio in support of our projects, including additional support for SBL and the assignment of CMI contracts in support of Stage 3.  On the financing side, Zach and his finance and treasury teams are preparing to kick off the financing process with the banks. So it's all coming together, and we look forward to continuing to deliver world-class execution on Stage 3.  Lastly, I want to highlight ESG as a priority goal for 2022. We made major strides on our ESG initiatives in 2021, specifically our climate and sustainability, where we demonstrated our leadership through several major programs announced last year.  Our initiatives from our cargo mission tags to our QMRV study with our producer and shipping partners are all the result of a multiyear effort built from our climate and sustainability principles, which we announced back in 2018.  These programs demonstrate our approach to climate and sustainability issues and opportunities, which center around transparency, science, our supply chain and operational excellence. We are pleased to see our efforts on this front being recognized by our communities and stakeholders.  Earlier this year, we were named a JUST 100 leader by JUST Capital, which ranks companies on corporate behavior issues such as climate job creation and community development. We are proud to be the top-ranked company in our sector and 35th overall out of nearly 1,000 companies. And just last week, we were ranked among America's most responsible companies in Newsweek's annual ESG performance ranking for the first time. My goal for 2022 is to advance our leadership position within our industry on these crucial efforts. Our ESG strategy is focused on being actionable, not aspirational. And the initiatives I detailed in 2021 are evidence of that. In 2022, we aim to further integrate ESG into our business and strategy. We believe it improves our competitiveness and enhances a long-term sustainability of our LNG. And these aren't just empty promises. We are putting our money where our mouth is. In 2022, 30% of our annual compensation scorecard, which applies to every Cheniere employee, will be based on ESG metrics and milestones.  2021 was truly a transformational year for Cheniere. Our successes are the product of a dedicated and results driven workforce that continues to inspire me. We begin 2022 with tremendous momentum and look forward to executing and delivering on the high expectations we set for ourselves year after year.  And now I'll turn the call over to Anatol, who will provide an update on the LNG market.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9. Let's start with a quick look at the full year numbers for 2021. Last year, we saw 5% growth in LNG imports compared to 2020, taking total trade to 374 million tons. This 18 million tonne year-over-year growth took LNG trade figures to well above pre-pandemic levels. Virtually, all the supply growth came from the U.S., which exported an additional 23 million tonnes year-over-year. Impressively, Cheniere was responsible for over half of that U.S. volume growth.  Despite the relatively healthy overall growth in total LNG trade, the increase in supply was more than matched by demand growth in Asia and Latin America, while imports into Europe declined by 9% year-over-year.  Low storage inventories in Europe following a period of cold weather early in the year and lower LNG and pipeline imports as compared to 2020 resulted in spot gas prices in Europe and Asia rising throughout the year, as the market became increasingly concerned about adequacy of storage fuel levels approaching winter in both regions.  The rising geopolitical tensions in Europe in the fourth quarter compounded market uncertainty, leading to unprecedented prompt price levels and extreme volatility during what is arguably the most inelastic demand period of the year.  As such, competition between Europe and Asia for LNG supplies led to a sharp inversion in the 2 regional price benchmarks of TTF and JKM, with Europe outbidding Asia to attract LNG cargoes in the fourth quarter. Both TTF and JKM reached record daily highs in December of last year, with TTF trading at $59.60 in MMBtu, more than $10 in MMBtu higher than JKM at $49.30.  More recently, an increase in LNG flows into Europe predominantly from the U.S. has helped alleviate some of the extreme market tightness we saw in the fourth quarter. TTF settled January at $28.90, while JKM settled at $35.70 in MMBtu, still, of course, high by historical standards, but well below the peak levels at year-end.  Please turn to Slide 10. With the resurgence of LNG imports in the fourth quarter, LNG represented 43% of all Europe's gas imports in December, with the U.S. providing over 1/3 or 36% of all LNG receipts. That share rose to 45% in January, reflecting the highest share of LNG volumes ever imported into Europe from any single country.  European LNG imports reached 22.6 million tonnes in the fourth quarter, up 36% year-on-year, as the storage deficit continued to widen. European storage levels started dipping below the 5-year lows around the middle of '21, with the deficit reaching about 19 billion cubic meters in December, over triple the deficit during the same period last year.  This period of low storage levels during '21 was caused by a number of factors: lower domestic production, coupled with lower pipeline imports from Russia into Continental Europe; constrained gas availability for injections and LDC demand throughout the year. In addition, lower renewables output and a drop in nuclear generation further exacerbated the fuel shortage.  Nevertheless, countries in Europe pressed ahead with planned coal and nuclear phaseouts last year. Germany, for example, shut down 7.3 gigawatts of coal capacity and 4.3 gigawatts of nuclear power capacity just prior to year-end.  We believe these dynamics, along with the recent geopolitical tensions impacting European gas prices, continue to signal that LNG will remain a critical component of Europe's energy mix for the long term.  At the same time, Asian LNG demand remained robust throughout '21, while policy and infrastructure investment signals continued to reinforce future demand growth in the region for the long term. Despite increased nuclear generation in Japan, overall Asian imports increased 8% to 273 million tonnes in 2021.  Nuclear outages and retirements in both South Korea and Taiwan, along with restrictions on coal burn in the winter, supported LNG import growth, while both continue to show policy commitments to increased use of natural gas as a primary energy source, what we have long described as the structural shift to natural gas.  Accordingly, Taiwan cleared the way for a new LNG import terminal, confirmed its plans to be nuclear-free by 2025 and committed to increase its use of LNG in its power mix from 36% currently to 50% by 2025.  Similarly, in its 14th gas plan on carbon neutrality roadmap, South Korea pledged to reduce the use of coal and nuclear and designated LNG as a green fuel in its taxonomy, supporting further near-term investment in natural gas infrastructure and underscoring the important role of natural gas as a primary fuel for South Korea in the long term.  China was the largest single contributor to demand growth last year, adding over 11 million tonnes of demand year-over-year and overtaking Japan as the world's largest LNG importer for the first time. China's significant economic rebound in 2021, which saw a GDP growth of 8.1%, fueled higher demand for virtually all energy products.  Last year, China announced plans to be carbon neutral by 2060 and reinforced its intention to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030. Both pledges are constructive for gas and LNG, as China's plans to grow its gas demand are concrete and already in progress. The country is currently building about 22 gigawatts of gas-fired power generation, adding over 100 million tonnes per annum of LNG import capacity by 2025 and has ramped up its gas and LNG term contract activity in recent months, including our recent long-term contracts with ENN, Sinochem and Foran.  Moving on to Slide 11. I'd like to highlight the rise in long-term contracting activity in the second half of 2021 and into 2022, which Cheniere has certainly participated in with the deals we signed last year and the one we announced this morning with EOG, effectively completing the commercialization of Stage 3.  There was a notable increase in commercial transactions during the year, with U.S. sourced LNG in high demand, which is intuitive given the relative stability and affordability of Henry Hub versus international gas hubs. International prices began to send that price signal midyear, with U.S. Gulf Coast margins moving above our long-term assumptions in the second quarter. The inexorable upward shift in midterm forward margins has continued to offer a tailwind to our commercial offering, which, as Jack highlighted, often includes bridging volumes.  Firm contracts with mid- and long-term tenors increased almost 80% year-on-year, surpassing 50 million tonnes in 2021. U.S. projects made up about 45% of total firm contracts, which is nearly double the amount of U.S. price deals last year. This surge in activity was underpinned by strong demand from Asia, particularly China. About 2/3 of all contracts signed in 2021 were executed with Asian buyers, 45% of which, in turn, were from China.  Cheniere is proud to have added several new customers in 2021, including our new buyers in China. The ongoing evolution of the Chinese gas market, including the expansion of non-NOC regas capacity access in China should facilitate terminal access and increase the exposure of emerging buyers to the international LNG market.  Cheniere's ability to execute these contracts efficiently, while providing buyers energy solutions tailored to the needs and constraints of their markets, demonstrates the competitiveness and flexibility of our offerings and the attractiveness of our product in providing support to policy decisions and other fundamental drivers impacting the energy landscape of the future.  In addition to organic market growth, the LNG market continues to undergo a transformation, as legacy contracts begin to expire, providing additional tailwinds to new contracts. Over 200 million tonnes are expected to expire over the next decade, and we estimate that for the period between 2026 and 2030, roughly 100 million tonnes of LNG contracts will need to be replaced.  While some of these could be renewed with existing suppliers, there are significant uncertainties surrounding feedstock availability, price indexation and direction, environmental profile and other geopolitical issues brought to the forefront by the recent market turmoil.  We see an increase in opportunities for new demand and long-term contracts emerging, as we believe a portion of these deals will form the basis of the next contracting cycle, and Cheniere continues to be well positioned to capture a segment of this demand, along with new contracts that underpin demand growth.  Now I'll turn the call over to Zach to review our financial results and guidance.\nZach Davis: Thanks, Anatol, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results as well as our key financial accomplishments, our increased 2022 guidance and our 2022 financial priorities.  Turning to Slide 13. During the fourth quarter, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $540 million, as our marketing and portfolio optimization teams continued to take advantage of our portfolio volumes in a sustained higher margin environment in global LNG markets.  Adjusted EBITDA was partially offset by an increase in realized losses from financial derivative instruments used to hedge our exposure to the commodity markets, in which we have contractual arrangements to purchase or sell physical LNG.  We recognized an income 520 TBtu of physical LNG during the fourth quarter, including 513 TBtu from our projects and 7 TBtu sourced from third parties. 87% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SPA or IPM agreements.  We generated a net loss of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. The net income line continues to be impacted by the unrealized derivative impact mainly related to our long-term IPM agreements, as we have discussed on prior earnings calls.  The derivative accounting, coupled with the long-term duration and international price basis of our IPM agreements, result in fluctuations in fair market value from period to period, as LNG curves move. While IPM agreements may contribute to this variability, those agreements provide us with the stable long-term cash flows that help support our infrastructure platform. And as such, we will continue to pursue them as part of our strategic growth plans, as we just demonstrated with the EOG-IPM agreement.  The EOG agreement effectively completes the commercialization of Stage 3, an accretive project, which meets our disciplined capital investment parameters related to returns, accretion and contracting.  For the full year, we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $4.9 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $2 billion, both exceeding our initial guidance ranges and coming in at the high end of the revised ranges we provided in November.  Our outstanding performance in 2021 was a result of the hard work and dedication of the entire Cheniere workforce, despite market volatility and continued COVID-related challenges throughout the year.  For the full year, we recognized an income almost 2,000 TBtu of physical LNG, including over 1,950 TBtu from our projects and just under 50 TBtu sourced from third parties. 83% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SPA or IPM agreements.  Before discussing our financial guidance and priorities for 2022, I'd like to also recap some of our key achievements in 2021. First and foremost, we rolled out our comprehensive all-of-the-above capital allocation plan, which was enabled by the near-term completion of our 9-train platform and the meaningful cash flow inflection point we have reached as a company.  Since the announcement in September, we have not only executed on the plan, but the time lines for achieving the goals of our capital allocation priorities have been accelerated due to the sustained higher margin environment.  Last year alone, we repaid $1.2 billion of indebtedness, strengthening our balance sheet and outperforming our $1 billion annual debt pay down goal. We raised over $5 billion in aggregate financing last year in support of our long-term balance sheet priorities, further demonstrating our access to capital and Cheniere's credibility with capital providers. Among our refinancing transactions in 2021, I'd like to highlight the 2032 unsecured notes we issued at CQP in the third quarter, as this transaction accomplished several key priorities simultaneously. With this transaction, we achieved the lowest price for a 10-year non-coal fired high-yield issuance in energy at 0.75%, which reduced interest expense by approximately $30 million per year; officially migrated project-level debt to the corporate level; and further desecured our consolidated balance sheet.  Through our combined refinancing and debt repayment activity in 2021, we extended the weighted average maturity of our outstanding debt by over a year and lowered our weighted average borrowing rate.  One of the primary objectives of the capital allocation plan is to achieve consolidated investment-grade credit metrics, and we are pleased that our accelerated execution on the plan is being recognized by the rating agencies in the form of continued ratings progression. Just last week, S&P upgraded both CEI and CQP to BB+, one notch away from investment-grade ratings, and maintain positive outlook at both companies. S&P cited improved financial metrics due to the progress we've achieved to date and the expectation of continued execution under the capital allocation plan as primary justification for the upgrade in positive outlook. As I mentioned a moment ago, we expect to surpass our $1 billion debt pay down goal again in 2022, as we have already exceeded over $0.5 billion of debt pay down since the beginning of the year with the redemption of the 2045 converts at CEI in January are generating significant cash flow and have the fully drawn freely prepayable credit facility of approximately $1.7 billion at Corpus to flexibly pay down over time. In 2021, we initiated a dividend at CEI for the first time and paid our inaugural quarterly dividend for the third quarter. In addition, we continued to repurchase shares under our newly reset $1 billion share repurchase program. For the year, we repurchased over 100,000 shares for approximately $9 million.  Although debt pay down remains our capital allocation priority in the near term, our share repurchase program is designed to be opportunistic and enable us to take advantage of dislocations in the market. As we continue to accomplish our debt pay down goals, we expect to be able to deploy incremental capital to our other capital allocation priorities, including capital return via future repurchase authorizations.  Finally, we made significant progress on commercializing Stage 3 to meet or exceed our disciplined growth capital investment parameters during the year.  2021 was truly a transformative year for Cheniere from a financial perspective. But as Jack mentioned, we expect to build on that and have an even better 2022.  Turn now to Slide 14, where I'll discuss our significant increase in 2022 guidance. We are increasing the consolidated adjusted EBITDA range to $7 billion to $7.5 billion and distributable cash flow range to $4.3 billion to $4.8 billion.  Since announcing our initial guidance ranges for 2022, Train 6 at Sabine Pass reached substantial completion considerably earlier than expected, enabling LNG sales from Train 6 to contribute to both EBITDA and DCF for almost 2 months longer than originally forecast.  In addition, the global LNG market continued to strengthen since November, providing an uplift in value to our remaining open volumes. And as we mentioned in November, the timing of a few cargoes around year-end 2021 also provide some tailwind to our forecast for 2022.  Thanks to the team's execution and the market fundamentals, this elevated guidance should provide us momentum to achieve record DCF per share levels in 2022 in the high teens as well as be a catalyst to achieving investment-grade credit metrics throughout the complex sooner than previously expected.  With respect to EBITDA sensitivity, we have sold over 95% of our total expected production for this year and have less than 100 TBtu unsold. We currently forecast that a $1 change in market margin would impact EBITDA by approximately $50 million for 2022, after accounting for the long-term origination volume placeholders.  This morning, we also announced an evolution in the CQP distribution plan, whereby the distribution is expected to be comprised of a quarterly base amount equal to $0.775 per unit or $3.10 annualized, plus a variable amount equal to the remaining available cash each quarter after first taking into consideration amounts reserved for debt repayment and other capital allocation priorities, including anticipated cash funded CapEx and cash reserves needed as part of the ordinary course of business.  This plan is expected to commence with the distribution related to the first quarter of 2022. As a result, we are raising full year 2022 distribution guidance range at CQP to $4 to $4.25 per common unit. This updated distribution plan is enabled by the completion of Train 6 and is dynamic, flexible and long term.  We believe it is an efficient way to accelerate cash returns to unitholders, while retaining flexibility for future debt pay down within CQP as well as growth opportunities at Sabine Pass. In short, a win-win for both CQP unitholders and CEI shareholders.  That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Jean Salisbury with Bernstein.\nJean Salisbury: My first question is for Anatol. I keep hearing from our European analysts and clients that even with all that's happened, European utilities are really hesitant to sign long-term gas deals above kind of 10 to 15 years because gas contracts are supposed to end by 2049.  That duration obviously makes it hard to get financing for new trains. So I guess, my question is, has that been what you've seen in your experience? And how do you see that mismatch shaking out over the medium term?\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Jean Ann. Thanks for the kind comments. Europe is, we think, evolving in a healthy direction now after some meaningful challenges that were a function of regulatory compacts and the kind of Brussels direction, the -- including gas in the green taxonomy is a key issue.  As you know, we've had some success with midterm and long-term deals that were on the kind of 10- to 15-year range. We expect to see more of that traction going forward. And whether we will see kind of a foundation customer commitment of 20-plus years out of a European load serving entity. It's too early to tell.  But given the recent developments, I think the trend is in the right direction. And clearly, we've demonstrated our ability to meet their objectives in terms of having the right environmental credentials for our product as well.\nJean Salisbury: Great. And then I think my second question is for Zach. Depending on how things go, it's possible that you could hit investment grade and be poised for S&P inclusion sometime next year. Can you talk about what it would take for Cheniere to get into the S&P? And are you actively positioning for that?\nZach Davis: We're doing the best we can on that, but it's not really in our control. We had met all the requirements for quite some time in previous years, whether it be market cap, sufficient free float and net income, and it's kind of hard to believe we wouldn't be the most logical energy candidate at this point. Considering, I believe, we're larger than the 1/3 of the energy constituent in the S&P 500.  However, with some of the unrealized derivative moves mainly related to the IPM agreements that are marketing to marketing those long-term deals based on the curves that keep on going up since last summer, we've had some negative net income quarters in a row. And we'll have to, I guess, wait, to an extent until we're positive net income on a cumulative 4-quarter basis. But at that point, yes, we check all the boxes, and we think it would be logical to happen later this year.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Lapides: One short-term question, one longer-term question. Short-term question is, I know you have a lot less open exposure in 2023 than you do in '22 just because you have so many contracts starting up. But with the futures curve having moved a ton, would you say you're being pretty active in the 2023 market for that open position? That's the first question.  Second question, more longer term. Would love your thoughts on the FERC policy statement about the evaluation of future gas infrastructure projects, pipelines, liquefaction, et cetera, and GHG emissions and what that means potentially for either getting asset -- new assets, Stage 3, Stage 4 type assets or new pipelines to serve those type of assets built.\nJack Fusco: Thank you, Michael. This is Jack. So I'll start. And as you know, we don't like to give a lot of guidance beyond 2022 at this point into 2023. But as you say, the market continues to get healthier, but it's extremely volatile. And you should expect us to be opportunistic out there, and I'll let Anatol who's biting at the bit to jump in.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Jack. Thanks, Michael. I'll just add to Jack's comments that, as you know, one of the more valuable components of our value proposition for long-term commitments are these bridging volumes. So that is a component that is increasingly becoming more valuable and more important in these discussions.  So on top of the volatility that Jack mentioned, husbanding those volumes to get us the long-term commitments that supports our long-term investment is a top priority.\nJack Fusco: Go ahead.\nZach Davis: Michael, I would just add, this is Zach, that with the 100 TBtu open this year and the dollar moved with $50 million, our forecast was assuming, let's say, mid- to high-teens netbacks. So even just this year, and now where the curves are moving all over the place today, we're talking about $1 billion of contribution to EBITDA just this year.  And next year, it is clearly attractive to us. But at the same time, for the next decade, we're almost 95% contracted on average. And we're really over 90% contracted on 9 trains through the early 2030s, which is really why it's time to FID Stage 3 this summer.\nJack Fusco: And then in regards to FERC, Michael, what -- In their new policy statements on greenhouse gas emissions for new pipelines, I'm very pleased that we've completed our $32 billion infrastructure project already. I am very pleased that Stage 3 is fully permitted.  I do think that we have a slight advantage because we've already completed our LCA as well as our CSR report. So we've been very transparent about our life cycle analysis and emissions profile for our LNG. And we think that's a competitive advantage when we want to continue to grow that we can show how it impacts that LCA.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Brian Reynolds with UBS.\nBrian Reynolds: I was wondering if you can give us an update on your expectations around the $2 billion in additional cash that you guided to at capital allocation day outside of what's accounted for with Stage 3 buybacks and dividends. Just kind of curious if post the guidance update if we should be thinking about this number, as you know, $4 billion to $5 billion through '24, and how potential expansions beyond CCL Stage 3 could impact this to cash.\nZach Davis: Sure. So this is Zach again. I'll just say, I thought we'd have a break for a couple of years before needing to come out with another capital allocation plan. But at the rate we're going, with $4 billion or more of DCF this year, and that original $10 billion available cash at this point through '24, it's closer to $14 billion. That's literally '22 through '24 is like $12 billion.  Our focus right now is really just to think about the $4 billion of debt pay down goal, the $1 billion buyback program, continue with growing the dividend, which we will grow this year, like we guided you all to. And we're already budgeting $800-plus million to kick off Stage 3 this year with FID.  So what you have here is we're likely going to finish those capital allocation plans, at the very least, a year early. And from there, we'll likely owe you a plan or an updated plan in the first half of next year or even later this year.  And it's logical to assume that base annual amount of debt pay down of $1 billion, that can come down a bit on a relative basis, and that we can be even more aggressive on the allocations to buybacks.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. Really appreciate all that color. And just a follow-up on future growth plans. It sounds like CCL Stage 3 is going to be mid this summer, and you know investors will start looking ahead at potentially CCL Stage 4 beyond that.  Just kind of curious just from a gas need perspective and, particularly, from the Permian, what ultimately do you need to see from a gas pipe perspective to support the long-term viability of an expansion at Corpus? Is it 1 to 2 pipes? Kind of what are you looking for, what are your customers looking for as you start to perceive plans for further growth beyond Stage 3?\nJack Fusco: Yes. So thank you, Brian. So when we look at both sites, we think that we're in the pole position. So we're in a very, very good position with our brownfield expansion capabilities at both facilities.  I would say, with Stage 3, we build even more infrastructure that helps us in our future growth projects, another pipe, another substation for power down there, more water. So I feel very good about our position to grow. As far as additional pipes coming out of the Permian, I'll ask Anatol if he has an opinion of what we would need going there.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Jack. Yes, Anatol has opinions. The -- I'll just add to Jack's comments that South Texas is a great place to be, to your point, about the Permian. And of course, that is one of the driving factors behind these IPM transactions and EOG, in particular.  So we are -- we have this symbiotic relationship with the infrastructure partners and the producers. And fortunately, to the previous question on FERC, the solutions tend to be intrastate solutions, which are, of course, an easier putt these days.  So we're very optimistic. The quantum of additional infrastructure, the market will decide on that. But we're optimistic that the producers have the resource, and we have the wherewithal, as Jack said, to grow our brownfield platform.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to touch somberly on Eastern European geopolitical developments there and wondering any thoughts you could share with regards to how that could impact negotiations over time for your product. Or any other thoughts you could share there?\nJack Fusco: Yes. Jeremy, I mean, it's tragic what's going on in Eastern Europe. And I'm very -- it saddens me to see the satellite images on the news screen as we've all witnessed this morning.  So -- but if anything, these high prices, the volatility drive even more energy security and long-term contracting. So I would say that the fact that there's a scarcity of LNG these days is driving more and more conversation on how to increase our infrastructure and secure monthly contracts for our European customers.\nAnatol Feygin: I think that's great, Jack. Obviously, you've seen the moves by, early on, Lithuania, Poland, others in the region to build that infrastructure and avail themselves of the supply. And as Jack said, the reliable and flexible product that we put on the water will be a key part of the solution going forward. The human toll and tragedy, obviously, has our thoughts and prayers.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. And then just kind of pivoting towards future growth plans and seeing like CCL 3. Seems like it's in the back pocket after negotiating EPC at this point. And as the market is always looking for what's next, just wondering if you could frame out a bit more, I guess, how you think about next steps here.  If -- it seems like there's a lot of acreage in Corpus and maybe you could do more there or looking at other sites for expansion or maybe I'm off base and returning capital will be a greater priority at that point. Just wondering if you could help us think through what could be next there.\nJack Fusco: Thanks, Jeremy, and I got to say you all are a tough crowd. There is a lot of work to be done between FID and then going operational on Corpus Stage 3. It's over 10 million tonne expansion project, which is equivalent to 2 of our large trains. And I'm excited to see my team in action and deliver another quality expansion project to the portfolio. But having said that, Zach, do you want to talk a little bit about...\nZach Davis: Sure. Jeremy, it doesn't hurt having $4.3 billion to $4.8 billion of DCF this year, which, just to put in perspective, it's $17 to $19 a share of cash flow. I don't think we thought we'd get there this quickly, but I think it just shows the value of the platform and, honestly, the value of our operations and construction teams to be able to give us this opportunity.  With those types of numbers and, clearly, margins above the 200 to 250 range for the foreseeable future, there's billions of dollars to go around. So we've already budgeted for $800 million on Stage 3 for the next 4 to 5 years to get that up and running by 2026 or so.  And then there's still billions. So you'll see us taking care of the balance sheet. Buybacks will have a large arsenal ready to go and the growing dividend. So it's really all of the above. It's just accentuated with a few more billion coming our way.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Sean Morgan with Evercore.\nSean Morgan: So just touching -- obviously, there's been a lot of success this year, and markets have kind of trended pretty favorably and the arb is wide open. So I'm wondering sort of the depths of the U.S. gas markets, and maybe it's adaptive relative to exports. But what percentage increase in total export capacity on the water right now from the U.S. Gulf could we see before we started to see an impact on kind of domestic pricing?\nAnatol Feygin: Well, I think it would be unfair to say that there hasn't been an impact on domestic pricing as the LNG industry takes 13 Bs a day or so, right, with us well over 7.  The market is in a healthy place now. One of the things we're watching for, of course, is how the production function responds. We're back setting records in terms of daily production. We are very comfortable that the resource availability is there.  There will be -- to some of the previous questions, the supply growth that we saw to the Northeast is probably not the bet to make going forward, but that gives us great comfort being in Western Louisiana and South Texas and the resource that can get to us, we think, at the 350 level.  And you've seen gas rig counts now surpass pre-pandemic levels. So we think that it will respond. But ultimately, the market will figure out if there's enough gas that is globally competitive to dispatch.\nSean Morgan: Okay. Regarding the EOG, IPM, I think you kind of made it clear this helps fill out your total required capacity for Stage 3. But is there sort of a limit in terms of the total notional export capacity that you would want to sign up for IPMs? I mean, is there any sort of puts and takes versus the offtake agreements? Or are they not necessarily mutually exclusive?\nZach Davis: I wouldn't say it's mutually exclusive. But at the same time -- at this point, we've signed up, let's say, I don't know, 4 or so million tonnes worth of IPM deals, maybe a little more than that. And we're -- that's in the context of eventually a 55-plus million tonne portfolio.  So it's still a rather small piece of the puzzle here, and what you're seeing is we're doing this with the most credible producers, which also gives us the benefit of the gas supply for extended periods of time and then with really strong counterparties credit-wise as well or investment grade wise as well.  So yes, I would say it's not ever going to be a majority of what we do, but I think Stage 3 is really indicative that it's going to be a nice mix of FOB, DES and IPM deals just showing the evolution of our commercial offering.\nAnatol Feygin: Just to piggy back on Zach's comments. The gas supply piece cannot be overstated, right? The fact that EOG in partnership with us is going to be delivering over 700 a day to this project, that will be a 25-plus million tonne project and the flexibility that we have, as Zach said, with the operational mix of the 3 products, which allows the operational side of the equation to be as reliable as we've seen in the last 5 years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Marc Solecitto with Barclays.\nMarc Solecitto: Just with the move up in the forward curve today, effectively extending the $20-plus LNG price environment through 2023, be curious to get your latest thoughts on the medium-term price outlook and just the general price responsiveness you've seen from customers as the forward strip has moved higher since the time of your last call.\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. So again, the tragic events of this morning, notwithstanding, you've seen a structural shift upwards in that curve that you referenced, right, as we progress through the second half of the year and the logistics of not just refilling European storage, but also meeting the inexorable growth out of Asia has been a challenge for the gas market, and that has caused those midterm margins to respond accordingly.  So that is obviously a tailwind as we've discussed. And rest assured that we will take advantage of that either in some of the more prompt transactions or more structurally through bridging volumes in our long-term commitments that, obviously, at this point of the cycle are nice tailwinds.\nMarc Solecitto: Great. Appreciate the color there. And then recognizing the long-term NPV and strategic considerations in your allocation of bridging cargoes for your open exposure this year, just wondering if there's a certain price point in the forward strip where you would perhaps allocate a greater percentage of the forward spot sales.\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. I guess, it is a balancing act and we would always -- let me clarify one thing. When we transact for these bridging volumes, these bridging volumes are done at market prices, right? They're embedded in the long-term deal, but they are at the economics that are in the prevailing market when we execute the transaction.  So we like the strategic benefit of having those long-term commitments and having that bulletproof reliable platform. That is kind of first and foremost in our thinking. To the extent that there are real-time opportunities, the team is very good at optimizing the portfolio and capturing that incremental margin that's available to us.\nJack Fusco: And I would say, Marc, that I spent 35 years in the power business, and I've seen this game before in electric power and this type of volatility. And what goes up will come down.  So all we're trying to do is secure our production for the long term through contracts with creditworthy counterparties and then help us build additional infrastructure without taking risk. So I'm not sold on having an entirely merchant portfolio.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.\nCraig Shere: I want to pick up on Jeremy's what -- next question and Michael's FERC question and see if you can perhaps elaborate on opportunities for further train upsizing efforts and also if the timing may be right in coming quarters some more actively pursue carbon capture.\nJack Fusco: Okay. So that's a load, Craig. So I'll start. I'm extremely pleased with our operational excellence program and the results of that. We've been able to increase our reliable production significantly from where we were back in 2016, 2017. I think there's still more to go there, and I'm excited about that.  As far as the expansion goes, I think we're very positive on Stage 3. As you've heard from us today, we're crossing the Ts, dotting the Is. I would expect us to launch full force with full FID sometime later this year. And then at that point, we'll start working on our next growth potential.  And then -- and as you know, in this industry, it's the worst kept secret. It takes FERC 2 to 3 years to do a review on an LNG export terminal, and it's pretty well public and transparent for the market to see. So I would say what I -- same thing I told Jeremy, which is you guys are a tough act. Stay tuned. We're not done yet. The second question, CCF, yes, we've spent a lot of effort with engineering and planning on CCF mostly at Sabine Pass now. We see that having the greatest opportunity or the least price, if you will, for some carbon capture.  We're not ready to announce anything yet, but we're making good ground on that aspect of it. And I'd say I'm totally supportive of the administration's desire to make 45Q a little more economically healthy for those of us in the fossil-fired industry.  I think we need it. We need to have a little bit better price signal on what the true price of carbon is going to be in America, and that will help us significantly. But we have some options there at both facilities. We've been focused on Sabine first, and there'll be more to come.\nCraig Shere: One quick follow-up. If you have the ability with a little CapEx to increase the 9-train portfolio capacity by say another 0.2, 0.3 mtpa per train, where do you stand on authorizations to do that?\nJack Fusco: No. We're -- if I remember right, our authorization now is up to $5.5 million tonnes per annum per train. So that gives us plenty of breathing room.\nOperator: And we'll be taking our last question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: I'll make this one quick. I think a lot has been asked and answered. But Jack, just going back to what you were saying a moment ago about taking some time to move through the process, whether it's CCF 3 or beyond, I mean, how do you think about potential acquisitions of existing sites just to kind of get a jump start on that whole process and/or if you could at least kind of conceptually set kind of a benchmark as to how you think about what you would be able to target mix volumes, right?  I mean, are we talking '24, '25 in terms of FIDs for subsequent volumes? Or how do you want to at least kind of set the cadence if that's the right word?\nJack Fusco: Yes. So I'll take it in two points. One, potential acquisitions. So we're building Stage 3. It looks like it will be around 6x EBITDA. You've seen where some of these LNG terminals have traded out with some of these infrastructure funds, multiples above the 6x EBITDA. So in this case, Julien, just like in power, where it would rotate whether it was cheaper to build or to buy, it's definitely cheaper to build than it is to buy and pay somebody else a premium.  So I would think, initially, at least on my crystal ball, I see us continue to do these brownfield expansions just from how cost competitive we are today. And now I forgot about the second half of that question.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: I was just saying, yes, if you're going to go the organic brownfield route, how -- what kind of...\nJack Fusco: Okay. So Stage 3 -- just -- Stage 3 won't come in one big lump. So on Corpus 3 and Sabine 6, right, when we took substantial completion, that was 5 million tonnes. Here it's going to be a train or 2 every couple of months. So if we start construction this year, I would expect sometime in '26 that we'd have the first train online. And then every couple of months thereafter, another train until we're fully up and running on that over 10 million tonne portfolio by 2027. So there'll be -- it's a pretty high growth rate. I would expect us to file for additional expansion soon.\nZach Davis: And the goal would be there to -- you have these trains coming online from '26 to '27 or even late '25 to '27. And ideally, we'll then have some growth to add to the portfolio in '27, '28, '29.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then on the acquisition front, even development assets down, like that's not ideal. I think that's what you were alluding to.\nJack Fusco: Yes. I mean, the Magnolia sold for over $2 million.\nOperator: At this time, I will turn the conference back to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks.\nJack Fusco: This is Jack. I just want to say thank you again for all of your support. I feel really good about where we are today. I think, overall, the industry needs to settle down a bit. I -- like Anatol said, our thoughts and prayers are with Eastern Europe at this point. But I think what's showing is the value of natural gas and LNG around the world, and I wish you all to be safe.\nOperator: And this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

            "name": "Anatol Feygin",
            "content": "Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9. Let's start with a quick look at the full year numbers for 2021. Last year, we saw 5% growth in LNG imports compared to 2020, taking total trade to 374 million tons. This 18 million tonne year-over-year growth took LNG trade figures to well above pre-pandemic levels. Virtually, all the supply growth came from the U.S., which exported an additional 23 million tonnes year-over-year. Impressively, Cheniere was responsible for over half of that U.S. volume growth.  Despite the relatively healthy overall growth in total LNG trade, the increase in supply was more than matched by demand growth in Asia and Latin America, while imports into Europe declined by 9% year-over-year.  Low storage inventories in Europe following a period of cold weather early in the year and lower LNG and pipeline imports as compared to 2020 resulted in spot gas prices in Europe and Asia rising throughout the year, as the market became increasingly concerned about adequacy of storage fuel levels approaching winter in both regions.  The rising geopolitical tensions in Europe in the fourth quarter compounded market uncertainty, leading to unprecedented prompt price levels and extreme volatility during what is arguably the most inelastic demand period of the year.  As such, competition between Europe and Asia for LNG supplies led to a sharp inversion in the 2 regional price benchmarks of TTF and JKM, with Europe outbidding Asia to attract LNG cargoes in the fourth quarter. Both TTF and JKM reached record daily highs in December of last year, with TTF trading at $59.60 in MMBtu, more than $10 in MMBtu higher than JKM at $49.30.  More recently, an increase in LNG flows into Europe predominantly from the U.S. has helped alleviate some of the extreme market tightness we saw in the fourth quarter. TTF settled January at $28.90, while JKM settled at $35.70 in MMBtu, still, of course, high by historical standards, but well below the peak levels at year-end.  Please turn to Slide 10. With the resurgence of LNG imports in the fourth quarter, LNG represented 43% of all Europe's gas imports in December, with the U.S. providing over 1/3 or 36% of all LNG receipts. That share rose to 45% in January, reflecting the highest share of LNG volumes ever imported into Europe from any single country.  European LNG imports reached 22.6 million tonnes in the fourth quarter, up 36% year-on-year, as the storage deficit continued to widen. European storage levels started dipping below the 5-year lows around the middle of '21, with the deficit reaching about 19 billion cubic meters in December, over triple the deficit during the same period last year.  This period of low storage levels during '21 was caused by a number of factors: lower domestic production, coupled with lower pipeline imports from Russia into Continental Europe; constrained gas availability for injections and LDC demand throughout the year. In addition, lower renewables output and a drop in nuclear generation further exacerbated the fuel shortage.  Nevertheless, countries in Europe pressed ahead with planned coal and nuclear phaseouts last year. Germany, for example, shut down 7.3 gigawatts of coal capacity and 4.3 gigawatts of nuclear power capacity just prior to year-end.  We believe these dynamics, along with the recent geopolitical tensions impacting European gas prices, continue to signal that LNG will remain a critical component of Europe's energy mix for the long term.  At the same time, Asian LNG demand remained robust throughout '21, while policy and infrastructure investment signals continued to reinforce future demand growth in the region for the long term. Despite increased nuclear generation in Japan, overall Asian imports increased 8% to 273 million tonnes in 2021.  Nuclear outages and retirements in both South Korea and Taiwan, along with restrictions on coal burn in the winter, supported LNG import growth, while both continue to show policy commitments to increased use of natural gas as a primary energy source, what we have long described as the structural shift to natural gas.  Accordingly, Taiwan cleared the way for a new LNG import terminal, confirmed its plans to be nuclear-free by 2025 and committed to increase its use of LNG in its power mix from 36% currently to 50% by 2025.  Similarly, in its 14th gas plan on carbon neutrality roadmap, South Korea pledged to reduce the use of coal and nuclear and designated LNG as a green fuel in its taxonomy, supporting further near-term investment in natural gas infrastructure and underscoring the important role of natural gas as a primary fuel for South Korea in the long term.  China was the largest single contributor to demand growth last year, adding over 11 million tonnes of demand year-over-year and overtaking Japan as the world's largest LNG importer for the first time. China's significant economic rebound in 2021, which saw a GDP growth of 8.1%, fueled higher demand for virtually all energy products.  Last year, China announced plans to be carbon neutral by 2060 and reinforced its intention to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030. Both pledges are constructive for gas and LNG, as China's plans to grow its gas demand are concrete and already in progress. The country is currently building about 22 gigawatts of gas-fired power generation, adding over 100 million tonnes per annum of LNG import capacity by 2025 and has ramped up its gas and LNG term contract activity in recent months, including our recent long-term contracts with ENN, Sinochem and Foran.  Moving on to Slide 11. I'd like to highlight the rise in long-term contracting activity in the second half of 2021 and into 2022, which Cheniere has certainly participated in with the deals we signed last year and the one we announced this morning with EOG, effectively completing the commercialization of Stage 3.  There was a notable increase in commercial transactions during the year, with U.S. sourced LNG in high demand, which is intuitive given the relative stability and affordability of Henry Hub versus international gas hubs. International prices began to send that price signal midyear, with U.S. Gulf Coast margins moving above our long-term assumptions in the second quarter. The inexorable upward shift in midterm forward margins has continued to offer a tailwind to our commercial offering, which, as Jack highlighted, often includes bridging volumes.  Firm contracts with mid- and long-term tenors increased almost 80% year-on-year, surpassing 50 million tonnes in 2021. U.S. projects made up about 45% of total firm contracts, which is nearly double the amount of U.S. price deals last year. This surge in activity was underpinned by strong demand from Asia, particularly China. About 2/3 of all contracts signed in 2021 were executed with Asian buyers, 45% of which, in turn, were from China.  Cheniere is proud to have added several new customers in 2021, including our new buyers in China. The ongoing evolution of the Chinese gas market, including the expansion of non-NOC regas capacity access in China should facilitate terminal access and increase the exposure of emerging buyers to the international LNG market.  Cheniere's ability to execute these contracts efficiently, while providing buyers energy solutions tailored to the needs and constraints of their markets, demonstrates the competitiveness and flexibility of our offerings and the attractiveness of our product in providing support to policy decisions and other fundamental drivers impacting the energy landscape of the future.  In addition to organic market growth, the LNG market continues to undergo a transformation, as legacy contracts begin to expire, providing additional tailwinds to new contracts. Over 200 million tonnes are expected to expire over the next decade, and we estimate that for the period between 2026 and 2030, roughly 100 million tonnes of LNG contracts will need to be replaced.  While some of these could be renewed with existing suppliers, there are significant uncertainties surrounding feedstock availability, price indexation and direction, environmental profile and other geopolitical issues brought to the forefront by the recent market turmoil.  We see an increase in opportunities for new demand and long-term contracts emerging, as we believe a portion of these deals will form the basis of the next contracting cycle, and Cheniere continues to be well positioned to capture a segment of this demand, along with new contracts that underpin demand growth.  Now I'll turn the call over to Zach to review our financial results and guidance. Thanks, Jean Ann. Thanks for the kind comments. Europe is, we think, evolving in a healthy direction now after some meaningful challenges that were a function of regulatory compacts and the kind of Brussels direction, the -- including gas in the green taxonomy is a key issue.  As you know, we've had some success with midterm and long-term deals that were on the kind of 10- to 15-year range. We expect to see more of that traction going forward. And whether we will see kind of a foundation customer commitment of 20-plus years out of a European load serving entity. It's too early to tell.  But given the recent developments, I think the trend is in the right direction. And clearly, we've demonstrated our ability to meet their objectives in terms of having the right environmental credentials for our product as well. Thanks, Jack. Thanks, Michael. I'll just add to Jack's comments that, as you know, one of the more valuable components of our value proposition for long-term commitments are these bridging volumes. So that is a component that is increasingly becoming more valuable and more important in these discussions.  So on top of the volatility that Jack mentioned, husbanding those volumes to get us the long-term commitments that supports our long-term investment is a top priority. Thanks, Jack. Yes, Anatol has opinions. The -- I'll just add to Jack's comments that South Texas is a great place to be, to your point, about the Permian. And of course, that is one of the driving factors behind these IPM transactions and EOG, in particular.  So we are -- we have this symbiotic relationship with the infrastructure partners and the producers. And fortunately, to the previous question on FERC, the solutions tend to be intrastate solutions, which are, of course, an easier putt these days.  So we're very optimistic. The quantum of additional infrastructure, the market will decide on that. But we're optimistic that the producers have the resource, and we have the wherewithal, as Jack said, to grow our brownfield platform. I think that's great, Jack. Obviously, you've seen the moves by, early on, Lithuania, Poland, others in the region to build that infrastructure and avail themselves of the supply. And as Jack said, the reliable and flexible product that we put on the water will be a key part of the solution going forward. The human toll and tragedy, obviously, has our thoughts and prayers. Well, I think it would be unfair to say that there hasn't been an impact on domestic pricing as the LNG industry takes 13 Bs a day or so, right, with us well over 7.  The market is in a healthy place now. One of the things we're watching for, of course, is how the production function responds. We're back setting records in terms of daily production. We are very comfortable that the resource availability is there.  There will be -- to some of the previous questions, the supply growth that we saw to the Northeast is probably not the bet to make going forward, but that gives us great comfort being in Western Louisiana and South Texas and the resource that can get to us, we think, at the 350 level.  And you've seen gas rig counts now surpass pre-pandemic levels. So we think that it will respond. But ultimately, the market will figure out if there's enough gas that is globally competitive to dispatch. Just to piggy back on Zach's comments. The gas supply piece cannot be overstated, right? The fact that EOG in partnership with us is going to be delivering over 700 a day to this project, that will be a 25-plus million tonne project and the flexibility that we have, as Zach said, with the operational mix of the 3 products, which allows the operational side of the equation to be as reliable as we've seen in the last 5 years. Yes. So again, the tragic events of this morning, notwithstanding, you've seen a structural shift upwards in that curve that you referenced, right, as we progress through the second half of the year and the logistics of not just refilling European storage, but also meeting the inexorable growth out of Asia has been a challenge for the gas market, and that has caused those midterm margins to respond accordingly.  So that is obviously a tailwind as we've discussed. And rest assured that we will take advantage of that either in some of the more prompt transactions or more structurally through bridging volumes in our long-term commitments that, obviously, at this point of the cycle are nice tailwinds. Yes. I guess, it is a balancing act and we would always -- let me clarify one thing. When we transact for these bridging volumes, these bridging volumes are done at market prices, right? They're embedded in the long-term deal, but they are at the economics that are in the prevailing market when we execute the transaction.  So we like the strategic benefit of having those long-term commitments and having that bulletproof reliable platform. That is kind of first and foremost in our thinking. To the extent that there are real-time opportunities, the team is very good at optimizing the portfolio and capturing that incremental margin that's available to us."

            "name": "Jack Fusco",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today, and thank you for your continued support of Cheniere. I'm pleased to be here this morning to review our 2021 results and successes, discuss our improved 2022 outlook and share my excitement about Cheniere's future.  2021 was a transformative year for Cheniere. First, we completed the construction of our initial 9 train platform and increased our run rate production to 45 million tons per annum. Second, we reached a meaningful cash flow inflection point. And third, we successfully executed a variety of long-term contracts to put Stage 3 on a path to FID this year. And the contract with EOG we announced this morning effectively completes the commercialization of Stage 3.  While 2020 proved our resilience, 2021 showcased the power of the Cheniere platform. The many competitive advantages I've discussed on these calls over the past -- close to 6 years were on full display throughout the year, each contributing to the results and the increased 2022 guidance we are providing this morning.  We begin 2022 in an extremely supportive LNG market environment, the extended period of volatility and elevated prices driven by an underinvestment in infrastructure and geopolitical tensions underscore the vital need for reliable, affordable, secure and environmentally competitive energy supplies on a long-term basis.  Please turn to Slide 5, where I will review key operational and financial highlights from the quarter and the year and introduce our upwardly revised guidance. For the fourth quarter of 2021, we generated a consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $540 million on revenue of approximately $6.6 billion. We exported a record 153 cargoes during the quarter, bringing our 2021 annual total to 566 cargoes of LNG shipped. We have now exported over 2,000 cargoes to 37 countries and regions around the world.  Throughout the year, we repeatedly raised full year EBITDA and DCF guidance after announcing the initial ranges in November of 2020, ultimately raising EBITDA and DCF guidance by $700 million and $600 million, respectively. And I'm pleased to report today that we delivered on the increased guidance, generating approximately $4.9 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $2 billion in distributable cash flow for the full year 2021. Today, we are raising full year 2022 guidance to $7 billion to $7.5 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $4.3 billion to $4.8 billion in DCF. This significant guidance increase is driven primarily by 3 factors: first, the earlier than forecast substantial completion of Train 6, which occurred in early February of this year; second, the further improvement in market margins since our November earnings call; and third, the timing of some cargoes that were shipped around year-end 2021, a variable which we mentioned last November.  In addition, we are raising our 2022 CQP distribution guidance range to $4 to $4.25 per unit and introducing a revised distribution plan. Today at CQP, we announced the initiation of a quarterly distributions to be comprised of a base amount, plus a variable amount, which we are expected to begin with the distribution with respect to the first quarter of 2022.  This distribution approach enables a more efficient distribution of CQP's cash, which is warranted given the completion of Train 6. Zach will cover the financial results and guidance updates in more detail in a few minutes. But clearly, we expect to build upon our success in 2021 and have an even better 2022.  Turn to Slide 6, where we'll take a victory lap on a transformative 2021. During the fourth quarter, our commercial momentum continued as we signed long-term SBAs with Sinochem and Foran, which built upon the long-term agreements we signed earlier in the year with Tourmaline, ENN and Glencore, and brought our aggregate long-term commercial volumes signed in 2021 to approximately 80 million tons equivalent and over $11 billion of fixed fees over the next 20 years or so. Both SPAs with Sinochem and Foran feature early or bridging volumes, further reinforcing the value of our tailored solutions in the market.  Our commercial success in 2021, coupled with the continued momentum demonstrated by the EOG agreement we just announced, as well as recent market dynamics, has brought Stage 3 even more into focus, and we remain confident in a midyear FID. I'll speak more about Stage 3 in a few minutes.  The excellent financial performance has enabled us to accelerate the execution of our comprehensive all-of-the-above capital allocation strategy announced in September. For the full year, we exceeded our goal of $1 billion of debt pay down by $200 million. And in 2022, we are already off to a fast start on debt reduction and expect to be able to significantly outperform the $1 billion target this year.  Additionally, we paid our first ever quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter of 2021, and we repurchased over 100,000 shares of LNG stock since we resumed share repurchases last year.  And of course, on execution, we continue to reinforce our market-leading reputation and track record on reliability, which has never been more important given the market's recent volatility and the critical need for energy security across the globe.  Substantial completion was declared on Corpus Christi Train 3 in the first quarter of 2021, and we just announced substantial completion on Sabine Pass Train 6 earlier this month. With the addition of these 2 trains, we have now completed our initial 9-train platform safely, ahead of schedule and on budget. We now process over 7 Bcf per day or approximately 7% of the total gas production in the U.S., and we do so every day with near perfect scheduling efficiency.  Finally, and more importantly, our safety metrics improved year-over-year in an especially impressive feat, considering we were commissioning and completing trains at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi during the year. Safety is the foundation of our success, and I'm proud that our continued focus on safety and operational excellence continues to yield tangible benefits for all Cheniere stakeholders.  Turning now to Slide 7. As I usually do on these year-end calls, I'd like to lay out some of my key goals for the Cheniere team to accomplish in 2022. This is not an exhaustive list of what I expect us to achieve this year, as the team in this room will certainly attest, but I wanted to highlight some of my top priorities for the year.  First and foremost, we intend to deliver on the upwardly revised financial guidance we provided this morning. We are excited about our significantly improved outlook for the year. Energy markets remain volatile, but we have a high degree of visibility into our ability to deliver results within the ranges provided given how we manage our exposure to the market.  Second, to get our Corpus Christi Stage 3 project to FID, Corpus Christi Stage 3 is a very competitive expansion project, which meets our financially disciplined growth, capital investment parameters and achieve the kind of accretive growth we target as part of our long-term capital allocation plan.  As I said a moment ago, the project is well positioned to be sanctioned, and it is fair to describe our remaining steps to FID as dotting our Is and crossing our Ts. We are working closely with Bechtel to finalize EPC contract and expect to conclude that soon.  We had great success in getting Corpus Christi Train 3 and Sabine Pass Train 6 underway with limited notices to proceed, or LNTPs, which derisked the projects and got them ahead of schedule early. We would look to do the same on Stage 3, so that's something that could happen in the near term as we progress towards a full FID and full NTP on all 7 trains sometime this summer.  On the commercial front, we are now working to finalize the contract portfolio for Stage 3, both in regard to potentially new long-term agreement as well as with existing agreements at CMI. The enhanced EOG-IPM agreement effectively completes the required commercialization support for Stage 3.  In addition, we have recently assigned the ENN and Glencore SPAs from CMI to Sabine Pass and expect to further optimize CMI's long-term contract portfolio in support of our projects, including additional support for SBL and the assignment of CMI contracts in support of Stage 3.  On the financing side, Zach and his finance and treasury teams are preparing to kick off the financing process with the banks. So it's all coming together, and we look forward to continuing to deliver world-class execution on Stage 3.  Lastly, I want to highlight ESG as a priority goal for 2022. We made major strides on our ESG initiatives in 2021, specifically our climate and sustainability, where we demonstrated our leadership through several major programs announced last year.  Our initiatives from our cargo mission tags to our QMRV study with our producer and shipping partners are all the result of a multiyear effort built from our climate and sustainability principles, which we announced back in 2018.  These programs demonstrate our approach to climate and sustainability issues and opportunities, which center around transparency, science, our supply chain and operational excellence. We are pleased to see our efforts on this front being recognized by our communities and stakeholders.  Earlier this year, we were named a JUST 100 leader by JUST Capital, which ranks companies on corporate behavior issues such as climate job creation and community development. We are proud to be the top-ranked company in our sector and 35th overall out of nearly 1,000 companies. And just last week, we were ranked among America's most responsible companies in Newsweek's annual ESG performance ranking for the first time. My goal for 2022 is to advance our leadership position within our industry on these crucial efforts. Our ESG strategy is focused on being actionable, not aspirational. And the initiatives I detailed in 2021 are evidence of that. In 2022, we aim to further integrate ESG into our business and strategy. We believe it improves our competitiveness and enhances a long-term sustainability of our LNG. And these aren't just empty promises. We are putting our money where our mouth is. In 2022, 30% of our annual compensation scorecard, which applies to every Cheniere employee, will be based on ESG metrics and milestones.  2021 was truly a transformational year for Cheniere. Our successes are the product of a dedicated and results driven workforce that continues to inspire me. We begin 2022 with tremendous momentum and look forward to executing and delivering on the high expectations we set for ourselves year after year.  And now I'll turn the call over to Anatol, who will provide an update on the LNG market. Thank you, Michael. This is Jack. So I'll start. And as you know, we don't like to give a lot of guidance beyond 2022 at this point into 2023. But as you say, the market continues to get healthier, but it's extremely volatile. And you should expect us to be opportunistic out there, and I'll let Anatol who's biting at the bit to jump in. Go ahead. And then in regards to FERC, Michael, what -- In their new policy statements on greenhouse gas emissions for new pipelines, I'm very pleased that we've completed our $32 billion infrastructure project already. I am very pleased that Stage 3 is fully permitted.  I do think that we have a slight advantage because we've already completed our LCA as well as our CSR report. So we've been very transparent about our life cycle analysis and emissions profile for our LNG. And we think that's a competitive advantage when we want to continue to grow that we can show how it impacts that LCA. Yes. So thank you, Brian. So when we look at both sites, we think that we're in the pole position. So we're in a very, very good position with our brownfield expansion capabilities at both facilities.  I would say, with Stage 3, we build even more infrastructure that helps us in our future growth projects, another pipe, another substation for power down there, more water. So I feel very good about our position to grow. As far as additional pipes coming out of the Permian, I'll ask Anatol if he has an opinion of what we would need going there. Yes. Jeremy, I mean, it's tragic what's going on in Eastern Europe. And I'm very -- it saddens me to see the satellite images on the news screen as we've all witnessed this morning.  So -- but if anything, these high prices, the volatility drive even more energy security and long-term contracting. So I would say that the fact that there's a scarcity of LNG these days is driving more and more conversation on how to increase our infrastructure and secure monthly contracts for our European customers. Thanks, Jeremy, and I got to say you all are a tough crowd. There is a lot of work to be done between FID and then going operational on Corpus Stage 3. It's over 10 million tonne expansion project, which is equivalent to 2 of our large trains. And I'm excited to see my team in action and deliver another quality expansion project to the portfolio. But having said that, Zach, do you want to talk a little bit about... And I would say, Marc, that I spent 35 years in the power business, and I've seen this game before in electric power and this type of volatility. And what goes up will come down.  So all we're trying to do is secure our production for the long term through contracts with creditworthy counterparties and then help us build additional infrastructure without taking risk. So I'm not sold on having an entirely merchant portfolio. Okay. So that's a load, Craig. So I'll start. I'm extremely pleased with our operational excellence program and the results of that. We've been able to increase our reliable production significantly from where we were back in 2016, 2017. I think there's still more to go there, and I'm excited about that.  As far as the expansion goes, I think we're very positive on Stage 3. As you've heard from us today, we're crossing the Ts, dotting the Is. I would expect us to launch full force with full FID sometime later this year. And then at that point, we'll start working on our next growth potential.  And then -- and as you know, in this industry, it's the worst kept secret. It takes FERC 2 to 3 years to do a review on an LNG export terminal, and it's pretty well public and transparent for the market to see. So I would say what I -- same thing I told Jeremy, which is you guys are a tough act. Stay tuned. We're not done yet. The second question, CCF, yes, we've spent a lot of effort with engineering and planning on CCF mostly at Sabine Pass now. We see that having the greatest opportunity or the least price, if you will, for some carbon capture.  We're not ready to announce anything yet, but we're making good ground on that aspect of it. And I'd say I'm totally supportive of the administration's desire to make 45Q a little more economically healthy for those of us in the fossil-fired industry.  I think we need it. We need to have a little bit better price signal on what the true price of carbon is going to be in America, and that will help us significantly. But we have some options there at both facilities. We've been focused on Sabine first, and there'll be more to come. No. We're -- if I remember right, our authorization now is up to $5.5 million tonnes per annum per train. So that gives us plenty of breathing room. Yes. So I'll take it in two points. One, potential acquisitions. So we're building Stage 3. It looks like it will be around 6x EBITDA. You've seen where some of these LNG terminals have traded out with some of these infrastructure funds, multiples above the 6x EBITDA. So in this case, Julien, just like in power, where it would rotate whether it was cheaper to build or to buy, it's definitely cheaper to build than it is to buy and pay somebody else a premium.  So I would think, initially, at least on my crystal ball, I see us continue to do these brownfield expansions just from how cost competitive we are today. And now I forgot about the second half of that question. Okay. So Stage 3 -- just -- Stage 3 won't come in one big lump. So on Corpus 3 and Sabine 6, right, when we took substantial completion, that was 5 million tonnes. Here it's going to be a train or 2 every couple of months. So if we start construction this year, I would expect sometime in '26 that we'd have the first train online. And then every couple of months thereafter, another train until we're fully up and running on that over 10 million tonne portfolio by 2027. So there'll be -- it's a pretty high growth rate. I would expect us to file for additional expansion soon. Yes. I mean, the Magnolia sold for over $2 million. This is Jack. I just want to say thank you again for all of your support. I feel really good about where we are today. I think, overall, the industry needs to settle down a bit. I -- like Anatol said, our thoughts and prayers are with Eastern Europe at this point. But I think what's showing is the value of natural gas and LNG around the world, and I wish you all to be safe."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Zach Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Anatol, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results as well as our key financial accomplishments, our increased 2022 guidance and our 2022 financial priorities.  Turning to Slide 13. During the fourth quarter, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $540 million, as our marketing and portfolio optimization teams continued to take advantage of our portfolio volumes in a sustained higher margin environment in global LNG markets.  Adjusted EBITDA was partially offset by an increase in realized losses from financial derivative instruments used to hedge our exposure to the commodity markets, in which we have contractual arrangements to purchase or sell physical LNG.  We recognized an income 520 TBtu of physical LNG during the fourth quarter, including 513 TBtu from our projects and 7 TBtu sourced from third parties. 87% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SPA or IPM agreements.  We generated a net loss of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. The net income line continues to be impacted by the unrealized derivative impact mainly related to our long-term IPM agreements, as we have discussed on prior earnings calls.  The derivative accounting, coupled with the long-term duration and international price basis of our IPM agreements, result in fluctuations in fair market value from period to period, as LNG curves move. While IPM agreements may contribute to this variability, those agreements provide us with the stable long-term cash flows that help support our infrastructure platform. And as such, we will continue to pursue them as part of our strategic growth plans, as we just demonstrated with the EOG-IPM agreement.  The EOG agreement effectively completes the commercialization of Stage 3, an accretive project, which meets our disciplined capital investment parameters related to returns, accretion and contracting.  For the full year, we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $4.9 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $2 billion, both exceeding our initial guidance ranges and coming in at the high end of the revised ranges we provided in November.  Our outstanding performance in 2021 was a result of the hard work and dedication of the entire Cheniere workforce, despite market volatility and continued COVID-related challenges throughout the year.  For the full year, we recognized an income almost 2,000 TBtu of physical LNG, including over 1,950 TBtu from our projects and just under 50 TBtu sourced from third parties. 83% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SPA or IPM agreements.  Before discussing our financial guidance and priorities for 2022, I'd like to also recap some of our key achievements in 2021. First and foremost, we rolled out our comprehensive all-of-the-above capital allocation plan, which was enabled by the near-term completion of our 9-train platform and the meaningful cash flow inflection point we have reached as a company.  Since the announcement in September, we have not only executed on the plan, but the time lines for achieving the goals of our capital allocation priorities have been accelerated due to the sustained higher margin environment.  Last year alone, we repaid $1.2 billion of indebtedness, strengthening our balance sheet and outperforming our $1 billion annual debt pay down goal. We raised over $5 billion in aggregate financing last year in support of our long-term balance sheet priorities, further demonstrating our access to capital and Cheniere's credibility with capital providers. Among our refinancing transactions in 2021, I'd like to highlight the 2032 unsecured notes we issued at CQP in the third quarter, as this transaction accomplished several key priorities simultaneously. With this transaction, we achieved the lowest price for a 10-year non-coal fired high-yield issuance in energy at 0.75%, which reduced interest expense by approximately $30 million per year; officially migrated project-level debt to the corporate level; and further desecured our consolidated balance sheet.  Through our combined refinancing and debt repayment activity in 2021, we extended the weighted average maturity of our outstanding debt by over a year and lowered our weighted average borrowing rate.  One of the primary objectives of the capital allocation plan is to achieve consolidated investment-grade credit metrics, and we are pleased that our accelerated execution on the plan is being recognized by the rating agencies in the form of continued ratings progression. Just last week, S&P upgraded both CEI and CQP to BB+, one notch away from investment-grade ratings, and maintain positive outlook at both companies. S&P cited improved financial metrics due to the progress we've achieved to date and the expectation of continued execution under the capital allocation plan as primary justification for the upgrade in positive outlook. As I mentioned a moment ago, we expect to surpass our $1 billion debt pay down goal again in 2022, as we have already exceeded over $0.5 billion of debt pay down since the beginning of the year with the redemption of the 2045 converts at CEI in January are generating significant cash flow and have the fully drawn freely prepayable credit facility of approximately $1.7 billion at Corpus to flexibly pay down over time. In 2021, we initiated a dividend at CEI for the first time and paid our inaugural quarterly dividend for the third quarter. In addition, we continued to repurchase shares under our newly reset $1 billion share repurchase program. For the year, we repurchased over 100,000 shares for approximately $9 million.  Although debt pay down remains our capital allocation priority in the near term, our share repurchase program is designed to be opportunistic and enable us to take advantage of dislocations in the market. As we continue to accomplish our debt pay down goals, we expect to be able to deploy incremental capital to our other capital allocation priorities, including capital return via future repurchase authorizations.  Finally, we made significant progress on commercializing Stage 3 to meet or exceed our disciplined growth capital investment parameters during the year.  2021 was truly a transformative year for Cheniere from a financial perspective. But as Jack mentioned, we expect to build on that and have an even better 2022.  Turn now to Slide 14, where I'll discuss our significant increase in 2022 guidance. We are increasing the consolidated adjusted EBITDA range to $7 billion to $7.5 billion and distributable cash flow range to $4.3 billion to $4.8 billion.  Since announcing our initial guidance ranges for 2022, Train 6 at Sabine Pass reached substantial completion considerably earlier than expected, enabling LNG sales from Train 6 to contribute to both EBITDA and DCF for almost 2 months longer than originally forecast.  In addition, the global LNG market continued to strengthen since November, providing an uplift in value to our remaining open volumes. And as we mentioned in November, the timing of a few cargoes around year-end 2021 also provide some tailwind to our forecast for 2022.  Thanks to the team's execution and the market fundamentals, this elevated guidance should provide us momentum to achieve record DCF per share levels in 2022 in the high teens as well as be a catalyst to achieving investment-grade credit metrics throughout the complex sooner than previously expected.  With respect to EBITDA sensitivity, we have sold over 95% of our total expected production for this year and have less than 100 TBtu unsold. We currently forecast that a $1 change in market margin would impact EBITDA by approximately $50 million for 2022, after accounting for the long-term origination volume placeholders.  This morning, we also announced an evolution in the CQP distribution plan, whereby the distribution is expected to be comprised of a quarterly base amount equal to $0.775 per unit or $3.10 annualized, plus a variable amount equal to the remaining available cash each quarter after first taking into consideration amounts reserved for debt repayment and other capital allocation priorities, including anticipated cash funded CapEx and cash reserves needed as part of the ordinary course of business.  This plan is expected to commence with the distribution related to the first quarter of 2022. As a result, we are raising full year 2022 distribution guidance range at CQP to $4 to $4.25 per common unit. This updated distribution plan is enabled by the completion of Train 6 and is dynamic, flexible and long term.  We believe it is an efficient way to accelerate cash returns to unitholders, while retaining flexibility for future debt pay down within CQP as well as growth opportunities at Sabine Pass. In short, a win-win for both CQP unitholders and CEI shareholders.  That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions. We're doing the best we can on that, but it's not really in our control. We had met all the requirements for quite some time in previous years, whether it be market cap, sufficient free float and net income, and it's kind of hard to believe we wouldn't be the most logical energy candidate at this point. Considering, I believe, we're larger than the 1/3 of the energy constituent in the S&P 500.  However, with some of the unrealized derivative moves mainly related to the IPM agreements that are marketing to marketing those long-term deals based on the curves that keep on going up since last summer, we've had some negative net income quarters in a row. And we'll have to, I guess, wait, to an extent until we're positive net income on a cumulative 4-quarter basis. But at that point, yes, we check all the boxes, and we think it would be logical to happen later this year. Michael, I would just add, this is Zach, that with the 100 TBtu open this year and the dollar moved with $50 million, our forecast was assuming, let's say, mid- to high-teens netbacks. So even just this year, and now where the curves are moving all over the place today, we're talking about $1 billion of contribution to EBITDA just this year.  And next year, it is clearly attractive to us. But at the same time, for the next decade, we're almost 95% contracted on average. And we're really over 90% contracted on 9 trains through the early 2030s, which is really why it's time to FID Stage 3 this summer. Sure. So this is Zach again. I'll just say, I thought we'd have a break for a couple of years before needing to come out with another capital allocation plan. But at the rate we're going, with $4 billion or more of DCF this year, and that original $10 billion available cash at this point through '24, it's closer to $14 billion. That's literally '22 through '24 is like $12 billion.  Our focus right now is really just to think about the $4 billion of debt pay down goal, the $1 billion buyback program, continue with growing the dividend, which we will grow this year, like we guided you all to. And we're already budgeting $800-plus million to kick off Stage 3 this year with FID.  So what you have here is we're likely going to finish those capital allocation plans, at the very least, a year early. And from there, we'll likely owe you a plan or an updated plan in the first half of next year or even later this year.  And it's logical to assume that base annual amount of debt pay down of $1 billion, that can come down a bit on a relative basis, and that we can be even more aggressive on the allocations to buybacks. Sure. Jeremy, it doesn't hurt having $4.3 billion to $4.8 billion of DCF this year, which, just to put in perspective, it's $17 to $19 a share of cash flow. I don't think we thought we'd get there this quickly, but I think it just shows the value of the platform and, honestly, the value of our operations and construction teams to be able to give us this opportunity.  With those types of numbers and, clearly, margins above the 200 to 250 range for the foreseeable future, there's billions of dollars to go around. So we've already budgeted for $800 million on Stage 3 for the next 4 to 5 years to get that up and running by 2026 or so.  And then there's still billions. So you'll see us taking care of the balance sheet. Buybacks will have a large arsenal ready to go and the growing dividend. So it's really all of the above. It's just accentuated with a few more billion coming our way. I wouldn't say it's mutually exclusive. But at the same time -- at this point, we've signed up, let's say, I don't know, 4 or so million tonnes worth of IPM deals, maybe a little more than that. And we're -- that's in the context of eventually a 55-plus million tonne portfolio.  So it's still a rather small piece of the puzzle here, and what you're seeing is we're doing this with the most credible producers, which also gives us the benefit of the gas supply for extended periods of time and then with really strong counterparties credit-wise as well or investment grade wise as well.  So yes, I would say it's not ever going to be a majority of what we do, but I think Stage 3 is really indicative that it's going to be a nice mix of FOB, DES and IPM deals just showing the evolution of our commercial offering. And the goal would be there to -- you have these trains coming online from '26 to '27 or even late '25 to '27. And ideally, we'll then have some growth to add to the portfolio in '27, '28, '29."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Randy Bhatia, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nRandy Bhatia: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Cheniere's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. The slide presentation and access to the webcast for today's call are available at cheniere.com. Joining me this morning are Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO; Anatol Feygin, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Zach Davis, Senior Vice President and CFO. Before we begin, I would like to remind all listeners that our remarks, including answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. And actual results could differ materially from what is described in these statements. Slide two of our presentation contains a discussion of those forward-looking statements and associated risks. In addition, we may include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the appendix to the slide presentation. As part of our discussion of Cheniere's results, today's call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP or CQP. We do not intend to cover CQP's results separately from those of Cheniere Energy Inc. The call agenda is shown on slide three. Jack will begin with operating and financial highlights, Anatol will then provide an update on the LNG market, and Zach will review our financial results and guidance. After prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO.\nJack Fusco: Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today, and thank you for your continued support at Cheniere. I'm pleased to be here this morning to review our third quarter results, and our increased financial guidance for 2021, as well as introduce our financial guidance for 2022. We are in the midst of an exciting and pivotal time in the global LNG market as the world continues its transition to a cleaner energy mix. I'm excited about Cheniere's prospects and advantaged position to compete and win in this market for years to come. Before we begin, I'd like to spend a minute discussing Hurricane Ida, a deadly Category 4 hurricane which impacted Louisiana during the third quarter. While the center of the storm made landfall well to the east of our facilities at Sabine Pass, many of our coworkers, neighbors, and other members of the Cheniere family were impacted with lost or damaged homes and property. Once again, I am pleased with Cheniere's response, and I am proud of how quickly and impactfully we supported those in need in the communities where we live and work, in Southwest Louisiana. In addition to providing direct financial assistance to disaster relief organizations, we once again partnered with the Astros Foundation to lead a three-day supply drive, in Houston, led by Cheniere's employee volunteers. We collected, sorted, and loaded six semi trucks with emergency supplies for our neighbors in need in Southwest Louisiana, while many employees from Sabine Pass traveled to the affected communities to help with the cleanup efforts. Fortunately, the Sabine Pass facility was spared by the storm, and we maintain continuous and stable operations throughout the weather event. I'd like to recognize our teams from production, operations, planning, marine operations, gas supply, meteorology, and many others for their tireless effort through this hurricane seasons and demonstrating safety as a core value at Cheniere. Now, please, turn to slide five, where I will review some key operational and financial highlights from the third quarter, as well as introduce our 2022 guidance ranges. For the third quarter, we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion. And for the fourth consecutive quarter, we are raising our full-year 2021 EBITDA guidance. We now forecast 2021 consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $4.6 billion to $5.00 billion. This increase in EBITDA guidance is driven primarily by higher net backs on open volumes due to increased global LNG prices, as well as increased lifting margins driven by higher domestic natural gas prices. While we are currently tracking to the upper end of this upwardly revised range, the specific timing of a few high-value CMI cargos scheduled to be loaded or delivered at the end of the year, which could slip into the beginning of 2022, drives a slightly wider range. Distributable cash flow grew to approximately $390 million. And we are reconfirming distributable cash flow guidance of $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion for 2021. During the quarter, we generated a net loss of approximately $1 billion. As we have discussed in prior quarters, our net income is impacted by the realized and unrealized gains and losses due to the derivative accounting treatment required on our natural gas and LNG hedges, as well as on our long-term integrated production marketing, or IPM, transactions. Zach will discuss the impact on our third quarter results in more detail in a few minutes. Now, looking ahead to 2022, I am pleased, today, to introduce full-year 2022 guidance of $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion of consolidated adjusted EBITDA, and $3.1 billion to $3.6 billion of distributable cash flow, reconfirming that our inflection point has arrived, a guidance range slightly wider than what we've historically provided is necessary due to the higher LNG margins, and considerable volatility in the market today, as well as the specific timing of delivery on some [DES] [Ph] cargo scheduled at or near the end of 2021 and early 2022. We expect the LNG market to remain tight, and to continue to provide a constructive backdrop for our business well into next year. The higher net-backs are complimented by higher expected volumes next year, driven by the substantial completion of Sabine Pass Train 6, expected during the first quarter, as well as the continued execution in our operational excellence program at both of our sites. We are truly excited about what next year holds for Cheniere, and we look forward to, once again, delivering results within the guided ranges. The third quarter was particularly meaningful for our company, as it featured the announcement of our comprehensive long-term all-of-the-above capital allocation strategy, which was enabled by our team's relentless focus on execution and operational excellence, which has placed Cheniere at a decisive cash flow inflection point. Our capital allocation plan centers around three primary principles which include; a strong and sustainable balance sheet, funding financially disciplined growth, and returning significant amounts of capital to our shareholders over time. To achieve these goals, we have committed to paying down on at least $1 billion of debt annually, through 2024, or until we achieve investment-grade credit metrics, declared our inaugural quarterly dividend for the third quarter, reset our $1 billion share repurchase program for the next three years, and laid out a plan to invest in Corpus Christi Stage 3 next year with internally generated cash flow. In line with these plans, we have repaid $750 million of debt across the structure in the first three quarters of 2021. So, we are on pace to meet or exceed the $1 billion target this year. The third quarter was also an extremely productive one for us in terms of operations and execution. And we, once again, achieved milestones across our business. On the production side, for the third quarter, we set a cargo record, this time with 141 cargos of LNG exported from our two facilities. Our production and marine teams at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi have continued to maximize asset availability and LNG production at both facilities, while maintaining our focus on safety. Last month, we reached a significant milestone at Sabine Pass Train 6, when feed gas was introduced for the first time as part of the commissioning process, with the project approximately 97% complete, and substantial completion expected in the first quarter of next year. [Indiscernible] continues to progress against an accelerated schedule, approximately one year ahead of the guaranteed completion date. We look forward to a successful commissioning process. We expect to have the first commissioning cargos around the year-end, and a smooth ramp up of Train 6 to stable operations. During the third quarter, we reinforced our leadership position on climate sustainability with the publication of our peer-reviewed LNG Lifecycle Assessment Study. This study is the first of its kind in the LNG industry, as the analysis utilize greenhouse gas emission data specific to our supply chain, and will therefore enable us to better assess greenhouse gas emissions across our LNG operations. I am proud of the continued progress we have made on this front; across so many different aspects of the company we will continue to integrate climate and sustainability throughout our business to improve environmental transparency and performance. This is especially important given the global focus on the LNG market presently. Barely a year ago, we were in a market environment of low prices, and pandemic-impacted demand. Today, however, it's clear the absolute critical role natural gas and LNG have to play in a global energy transition and the viability of LNG and natural gas as a key source of reliable energy supply for decades to come. Now, turn to slide six, where I'll highlight Cheniere's significant commercial momentum, and the market dynamics supporting our increased financial guidance and confidence in the FID of Corpus Christi Stage 3 in 2022. We kicked off the third quarter with the announcement of our newest long-term IPM contract with a Canadian natural gas producer, Tourmaline. Just after the quarter ended, we announced two long-term SPAs, with ENN and Glencore. The SPAs with ENN and Glencore are approximately 13-year contracts executed with CMI, and done on an FOB basis. The signing of these long-term contracts extends our percent contracted of the nine-train portfolio to over 90% through this decade. And we maintain the flexibility to assign the ENN and Glencore deals to a specific project. Looking ahead, we estimate another three million tons or so is needed to fully sanction Stage 3. And with our origination team, as busy as they are, I'm confident we'll get that required commercial support in the coming quarters. In the short-term market, we have witnessed significant volatility and record prices for LNG and natural gas across the globe, with storage level in key demand centers below historic levels. As we approach the winter season, we expect demand and prices to remain elevated into 2022, which gives us confidence in our guidance for next year. On the long-term side, LNG market fundamentals are as constructive for long-term contracting and the construction of new liquefaction capacity, as I've seen at any point, since I joined Cheniere. Anatol has a lot of good information to share with you in a moment, but we're seeing LNG consumers recognize the importance and the value of securing long-term natural gas supply and price visibility, both of which a contract with Cheniere provides. And we market to those consumers now as the second largest producer of LNG in the world. This is a major competitive advantage, as it demonstrates our ability to execute and fulfill our promises to our customers, something they value significantly in today's market. We are responsible for providing our customers with flexible and reliable energy supply in the size, scale, and hard earn reputation of reliability of the Cheniere platform enables us to be a dependable partner for our customers. In addition, being able to offer flexible solutions that are tailored to the unique needs of our customers is a competitive advantage that is virtually impossible to replicate in the near term. Our commercial momentum coupled with a significant tailwind in the long-term LNG market, underscores our progress towards FID of Corpus Christi Stage 3. While our confidence in 2022 FID grows, we remain committed to our discipline capital investment parameters to ensure the risk and return profile is consistent with that of the first nine trains we built. You've heard me say this before. But it's worth repeating. We aren't in the FID business. We're in the value creation business. With that, I'll turn the call over to Anatol, who will provide more detail around current market dynamics.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8. As Jack just mentioned, we maintain an increasingly constructive view of the global LNG markets for the balance of this year and well into 2022. Higher demand for our product driven by the need to replenish gas and LNG storage inventories after the cold winter last year, coupled with higher year-on-year demand due to improved economic activity around the world resulted in a significant run-up in prices through the summer. Because of this imbalanced market, we've witnessed unprecedented price spikes across all gas and LNG benchmarks. Global natural gas and LNG prices remain above seasonal norms starting concerns about sustained tightness in LNG supplies ahead of a potentially colder than normal winter once again. TTF settled September at over $15/MMBtu and touched an all-time high of $55/MMBtu in early October. JKM settled October at over $19/MMBtu and hit a new intraday all-time high of over $56/MMBtu in October after averaging around $4/MMBtu in 2020. While our long-term customers are largely insulated from these dramatic price swings and our CMI business can capitalize on these dislocations in the short term. Sustain market volatility could be disruptive for industry as it potentially incentivizes end use customers to utilize cheaper, higher polluting fuels in the short-term. The rapid economic recovery in key LNG markets paired with some of the structural factors impacting Europe and Latin America helped the LNG market achieve higher growth levels this year. LNG consumption increased 7% in the third quarter and made intense competition for supplies between the Atlantic and Pacific basins. This tug of war has certainly exposed the supply constraints facing the industry in the wake of the pandemic. Global LNG supplies grew 8.7 million tons year-over-year in the third quarter, while exports from the U.S. grew approximately 10.7 million tons during the same period. The consistent gains in U.S. exports have been instrumental in providing much needed supplies to the market, offsetting the declines from legacy facilities. In fact, 28 million tons of new LNG capacity, most of which is U.S.-based has come to the market in the past two years, which has more than offset the approximately 19 million ton decline in production from legacy plants in the same time period. This new supply has played a critical role in alleviating some of the global supply shortage while helping mitigate some of the underlying volatility. Let's turn to Slide 9, having covered the supply side of the equation, let's now look at some of the demand side factors driving the markets sustained imbalanced through the third quarter, as mentioned demand in some key Asian markets has been driven by end user buying in order to refill storage ahead of winter, in many cases bidding volume away from Europe. Weather has also played a meaningful role in volumes during the third quarter with severe droughts in Latin America earlier this summer and last year in China, having reduced the availability of hydroelectric power generation sources, increasing demand for gas and further exacerbating the seasonal storage deficit. In Latin America, for example, third quarter demand was up over 100% compared to last year, primarily from the traditional hydro markets of Brazil and Argentina. These factors coupled with efforts to replenish supply levels ahead of winter, intensified the inter basin competition with Asia for incremental LNG volumes throughout the third quarter. In Asia, China's LNG imports increased 13% in the third quarter and made significant growth in the power and city gas sectors, as the focus on switching to cleaner burning fuels continues to grow. China's gas fire power demand increased 23% on the year and its city gas demand grew 18% year-over-year, resulting in widespread power rationing in October in mid gas and coal supply shortages. In South Korea, nuclear outages in July and August also boosted demand for gas fire power generation by approximately 25%, leading to a 58% increase in LNG imports year-over-year in the third quarter, as this impact was incremental to higher demand from replenishing low gas storage inventories. In Europe, storage levels remained at multi-year lows around 22 BCM below the five-year average. The perfect storm or unfortunate combination of lower LNG imports, lack of wind in the North Sea and low incremental pipeline supplies from Russia, coupled with rising coal and carbon prices have driven gas prices in Europe to record highs. Despite having been responsible for balancing the market for much of the pandemic Europe relinquish volumes to more price inelastic markets in Asia and Latin America with LNG imports lower by 19% year-over-year in the third quarter, as illustrated in the chart on the lower right-hand side of the slide. While U.S. LNG imports to the region during the third quarter were up 97% versus the third quarter last year and 76% versus 2019. The strong call on U.S. supplies to meet regional demand in Asia and Latin America meant that U.S. LNG exports to Asia rose 215% versus pre-pandemic levels of 2019. And those to Latin America climbed 52%. These regions sends very strong buy signals to attract higher U.S. flows in an effort to avoid shortages due to fewer pipe gas alternatives and constraints on coal and hydropower availability. Please turn to the next slide. The market significant volatility in the last 18 months has unquestionably placed a strain on energy systems around the world, signaling the need for additional investment in new LNG capacity. As discussed previously, we've expected the market to tighten starting this year due to the historically low volume of FIDs taken between 2015 and 2018, despite the substantial growth in global demand forecasted across developed and developing regions, which is driven by the structural shift to natural gas, as we've discussed on these calls for several years. Based on our assessment of the markets, the FIDs taken back in 2011 through 2014, contributed to a softer market from 2015 through 2020 as the market digested the rapid addition of significant new supply. But the market has not reached a cyclical inflection point and it's calling for new capacity to be added, while much of the current tightness has been exacerbated by confluence of short-term factors, impacting supply and demand. We do expect the underlying markets to remain tighter as a result of the pandemic, which reset the supply cycle and forced companies to employ stricter capital allocation parameters and deferred many project FIDs. We now estimate that this tight market could extend well through 2025 and potentially tighter seasonal swings over the midterm period, especially for production from legacy plans remains in elastic and the current constraints on the coal supply cycle persist. Recall that, just last year stakeholders in our industry were more concerned about security of demand than security of supply. That perspective has certainly been reset by the current market conditions, which we believe create tailwinds for long-term contracting of reliable and affordable LNG sources like our Corpus Christi Stage 3. Our plan to expand our Corpus Christi facility is part and parcel of our strategy to invest in accretive growth projects that deliver value to our shareholders and provide flexible, reliable LNG supply for our customers. And we believe the visibility on price certainty that's central to the structure of our long-term contracts will be increasingly attractive to LNG buyers under current market conditions. You're beginning to see this manifest in the market with long-term contracting activity, clearly increasing the last few months. As Jack mentioned, we're very excited about our newest long-term customers, ENN and Glencore and look forward to building on this momentum as we continue to commercialize our growing platform. The meaningful engagement we're having with both existing and prospective customers, gives us great confidence that we're marketing solutions valued by the market, and we expect to maintain that commercial momentum into next year and reach FID on Stage 3. The current market volatility coupled with the environmental and economic attributes of our product lead us to remain quite sanguine about the critical role LNG and natural gas have in the global energy market, both as a destination fuel as well as a key enabler in the global transition to lower carbon energy sources. Thank you all for your time. I'll now turn the call over to Zach who will review our financial results and guidance.\nZach Davis: Thanks, Anatol and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our third quarter financial results and our increased full-year 2021 EBITDA guidance, as well as provide you with some more detail regarding our full-year 2022 guidance. Turning to slide 12, for the third quarter, we generated revenue of approximately $3 billion, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.1 billion, distributable cash flow of approximately $390 million, and a net loss of approximately a billion dollars. Our net income results for the quarter were negatively impacted by the accounting treatment for our realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments, which includes our long-term IPM agreements. As we have discussed in prior quarters, our IPM agreements, certain gas supply agreements and certain forward sales of LNG qualify as derivatives and require mark-to-market accounting, meaning that from period to period, we will experience gains and losses as movements occur in the underlying forward commodity curves. This accounting treatment coupled with the significant volumes, long-term duration and volatility and price basis for certain contracts, and most notably, our IPM agreements will result in fluctuations in fair market value from period to period. By operationally we seek to eliminate commodity risk by matching our natural gas purchases and LNG sales on the same pricing index, our long-term LNG SBAs do not currently qualify for mark-to-market accounting, meaning that the fair market value impact of only one side of the transaction is often recognized on our financial statements until the sale of LNG occurs. The unfavorable pretax impact from changes in the fair value and settlements of our commodity and FX derivatives during third quarter 2021 was approximately $3.5 billion, $3.1 billion of which was non-cash, including approximately $2.5 billion directly related to our IPM deals, which were the primary driver of our recognized net loss for the third quarter. I want to highlight that the impact is substantially all non-cash and tied to the significant volatility we have experienced in the global LNG market, which is otherwise served as a significant tailwind for our businesses from both financial and commercial perspective. The tailwinds are reflected in our increased guidance for 2021 and the 2022 guidance we are rolling out this morning above our normalized run rate ranges. For the third quarter, we recognized an income 499 TBtu of physical LNG, including 489 TBtu from our projects, and 10 TBtu from third parties. Approximately 78% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SBAs or from volumes procured under our IPM agreements. We received no-cargo cancellations and had no impact to revenue recognition timing related to cargo cancellations in the third quarter. As Jack mentioned, we are proud to have announced our long-term comprehensive capital allocation plan in September. Thanks to the success achieved by the Cheniere team over the past five years, we have certainly reached a cash flow inflection point that supports our capital allocation priorities of balance sheet management, financially disciplined growth, and returning capital to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. As you may recall, we initially targeted $500 million of debt reduction this year, which we've exceeded by approximately $250 million through the third quarter alone. In line with our capital allocation plan, year-to-date, we've extended the weighted average maturity of our outstanding debt by over a year, lowered our weighted average borrowing rate by over 15 basis points, reduced the percentage of our outstanding debt that is secured by approximately 10% and lowered our LTM leverage by over a turn. During the third quarter, we issued $750 million of fully amortizing 2.742% public senior secured notes due 2039 at CCH, and used the net proceeds to refinance a portion of the borrowings under the CCH's credit facility due 2024. This transaction the lowest yielding bond ever secured by Cheniere not only extended the maturity of our borrowings, but also better matched our contracted cash flows with the timing of debt repayment. In September, we issued $1.2 billion of 3.25% senior notes due 2032 at CQP. This transaction execute on every aspect of our capital allocation strategy. We use the proceeds to refinance CQP's 5.625% senior notes due 2026 and a portion of the 6.25% senior secured notes due 2022 at SPL were refinanced with the indebtedness migrated to CQP. Not only do we achieve the lowest pricing for a 10-year high yield issuance in energy, we efficiently migrated debt from the projects and further de-secured our consolidated balance sheet. Pro forma for the payment made in October with a portion of the proceeds from the CQP 2032s along with cash on hand, there's approximately $700 million currently remaining on the 2022 SPL notes. We expect to redeem approximately $500 million of this amount via committed long-term amortizing fixed rate notes at SPL. We entered into on a private placement basis, which are expected to be funded this quarter. The remaining approximately $200 million is expected to be paid down with cash flow. In October, we amended our existing $1.25 billion CEI revolving credit facility with 23 financial institutions extending the maturity to 2026 and lowering our borrowing rate. Perhaps most notably, the amended facility includes bespoke ESG loan features that provide economic incentives related to defined ESG milestones. Specifically, these incentives include potential reductions in interest rate and commitment fees for certain sustainability linked expenditures, such as expenses to support our QMRV programs and the achievement of specified climate related milestones like establishing the cargo emissions tags in the coming year. In addition to our progress on managing our maturities during the quarter, we resumed share repurchases under our original share repurchase authorization. In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 77,100 shares for approximately $6 million. Our new three-year $1 billion share repurchase program commenced October 1. Turn now to Slide 13, as previously mentioned, today, we are again increasing our guidance range for full-year 2021 consolidated adjusted EBITDA and reconfirming the range for distributable cash flow. A revised guidance range for 2021 consolidated adjusted EBITDA is $4.6 billion to $5 billion. So, the low end of the range remains unchanged, but we are raising the high end by $100 million. The high end is moving up due mainly to the higher margins we expect to capture on our CMI volume. Though, the low end is staying the same simply due to the variability around the specific delivery dates on a number of high valued DS cargos sold by CMI, which are scheduled to be delivered right around yearend and early next year. We'll earn the EBITDA associated with these cargos either way, but it may end up weighted into 2021 or 2022 depending on the specific logistics of those cargo deliveries. The DCF guidance range for 2021 remains at $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion. While the ranges unchanged, we are now tracking to the high end as the factors moving up our EBITDA forecast are also positively impacting our DCF forecast. While on the subject of DCF, we have made an important update to our financial reporting and guidance with respect to this metric. Starting with 2022 guidance, we have adopted a new definition for distributable cash flow that we believe better reflects the consolidated cash flow of each of our wholly-owned subsidiaries as well as CQP. Currently, without this change, our DCF is calculated based on only distributions declared at CQP, which are impacted by CQP's capital allocation decisions, including debt paydown and capital spend at Sabine Pass. Rather than have capital allocation decisions made at our subsidiaries impact consolidated DCF, we have revised our calculation to properly reflect the consolidated cash flow of the entire Cheniere complex, less amounts attributable to non-controlling interests. The new definition accounts for a 100% of CQP's distributable cash flow being distributed to Cheniere Energy Inc. or said differently assumes a one times coverage ratio at CQP, which will incorporate all cash flow generated in CQP before capital expenditures, retain cash flow, and distributions. Please note this change does not affect our run rate DCF guidance, as we have always assumed a one-times coverage ratio for CQP, and our run rate forecasts to reflect this dynamic. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect to have another outstanding year, and are guiding to $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion of consolidated adjusted EBITDA, and $3.1 billion to $3.6 billion of distributable cash flow. The market today is well above our long-run CMI margin assumption of $2.00 to $2.50, so 2022 should be a landmark year for Cheniere, with all nine trains up and running, and our financial forecast well above our run rate guidance. At CQP, we are forecasting a significant step up in distributions, with guidance ranging from $3.00 to $3.25 per unit. Like our upwardly revised 2021 guidance, our figures for 2022 are largely driven by the continued strength of the LNG market, and our ability to capture higher net backs on our open volumes, which will be higher in 2022 thanks to the accelerated schedule for substantial completion at Sabine Pass Train 6, and continued production optimization at both of our sites. As we enter 2022, we expect to have approximately 150 TBtu of open or unfilled capacity at CMI. Our EBITDA sensitivity to a dollar move in market margins is less than $150 million. While we have assumed some of that 150 TBtu at the current curve, we have also reserved a portion of the open volume strategically as bridging volume, for long-term origination transactions, similar to the ENN and Glencore SPAs. The net volume is therefore marked at prices that blend the near-term curve with the long-term market price. There is a wider guidance range for 2022 than we have provided in previous years due to a number of related factors. Store open capacity for next year is only approximately 7% of our total forecasted P&L production. The higher margins in the market means the EBITDA that each TBtu of LNG contributes is higher, and therefore the impact from each cargo is amplified. In addition, the specific timing of Train 6 substantial completion, as well trajectory of that train reaching stable operations, and the timing of delivery of the CMI cargo scheduled for the very end of this year and early next year, all help justify starting with a slightly wider guidance range than we have historically provided for initial guidance, two months ahead of the year. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nChristine Cho: Good morning, everyone. I thought maybe we could start with '22 guide. The range is pretty strong out of the gate. But your open capacity would indicate that you guys have put away a decent amount of cargos in the last several months, for next year. Can you just provide a little more color on what's assumed in the low and high end of the guide, other than what you already told us, Zach, about timing of the year-end cargos? The 150 TBtu that's open, what does that assume for Train 6 start? Is there anything in there for 1Q? And are you using these forward curves for the open capacity in your assumptions?\nJack Fusco: Thank you, Christine. And we'll have Zach answer the question.\nZach Davis: Hey, Christine. So, we're pretty excited about 2022, will be our first year with nine trains operational. And we should have record production of around 43 million tons for the year or over 2,200 TBtu. So, when you think about 150 TBtu open, that's less than 7% of our total P&L production next year. And then I would say that that open volume is going to contribute, give or take, around $1 billion. And that's after accounting for the fact that though the curve next year is around, let's say, $10.00 or so, we reserved a portion of the cargos of this open capacity for some additional long-term origination deals with bridging volumes similar to how we structured the ENN or Glencore deals. So, that's basically how it's set up. We assume Train 6 is coming online at the end of Q1. And there's some flexibility in there in terms of some of those high-priced LNG cargos. We literally have a couple cargos that are close to almost $100 million of value to us, either being delivered late this year, early next. So, with some flexibility on exactly when substantial completion can occur, and some of that timing, that that just forced us to think about a $500 million range when margins are around that $10.00 versus last year, when we came into the year they were around $0.50, even though we had even more capacity open at the time.\nChristine Cho: Okay, great. That is helpful. And then, can you guys give a little more color on the contracts that you signed in the recent months around the short-term and medium-term deals. It looks like the long-term, 10-year-plus deal terms have not really changed. But I would imagine the terms for the one to three-year deals have gone up, especially after the reset in the supply cycle that Anatol discussed. What are the market rates for something like that? And if the long-term deal, the terms do not change, and customers are maybe realizing that they can't rely on the spot market for their firm needs, what would you say is the biggest sticking point in negotiations for long-term contracts right now?\nJack Fusco: Anatol?\nAnatol Feygin: My turn? All right, thanks, Jack. Good morning, Christine. The -- so, as Zach mentioned, we -- the market for those midterm transactions is the market. So, we reserve them as volumes for the origination efforts we think having the right solutions, the flexibility to start volumes without a condition precedent start them before additional capacity comes on is all very important, and has been a key differentiator for us. So, those volumes are blended into the contract either commercially or the way we account for them, either way. But in the font for the liquid part of the curve, we include those economics in that long-term transaction on an [MPV] [Ph] neutral basis to us. So, that's very important to us. And as you've seen with ENN, Glencore, and others that maybe you haven't seen explicitly, that that's a key differentiator. And we will earn that curve over the life of the deal.\nChristine Cho: Okay.\nZach Davis: And I'll just -- sorry, I was just going to add that it was like literally a year ago we were around 85% contracted as a company, and Jack said the goal was, in the next few years to be 90% contracted. And we're now 90% contracted on the nine-train program through the early 2030s, with all the work that's been done. And with all the deals that we've signed, midterm deals, long-term deals, that Anatol and the commercial team have signed this year, it's over $6 billion of fixed fees, just to give you a sense of how much de-risking has occurred.\nChristine Cho: Great, thank you.\nJack Fusco: And, Christine, it's --\nChristine Cho: Yes.\nJack Fusco: Christine, it's -- [technical difficulty]. So, there are some DES deals, there's IPM, there's FOB. It's all of the above, because we participate on the whole value chain.\nChristine Cho: Right.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nJack Fusco: Morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Thanks for all the color on the LNG market here. Just wanted to pick up with that a bit more, particularly as it relates to the medium-term, as you laid out, there's really few other plants that are under construction in the near-term, and there's others facing delays, such as Mozambique and LNG Canada. Also we have the European Union carbon prices have doubled year-to-date. Just wondering if you think this sets us up for kind of a stronger for longer LNG pricing into the kind of more of a medium-term timeframe there? And how CMI could benefit from that?\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Like we said, this was supposed to be, to us, a transition year that was difficult to call. And everything that we've talked about has created a much more rapid transition. And as you said, that the volumes that are coming into the market '22 through '25, delays on upstream FIDs, delays on liquefaction FIDs, some of both actually being cancelled, as you've seen in recent history, gets us well through the mid 20s. And on the demand side, we just see a continued commitment to natural gas. I mean you see these numbers out of China which is, through tree quarters, is the leading market. It's surpassed Japan, it's about two million tons higher now on the year, most likely will be the largest market. And we don't see that market slowing down. And its commitment to natural gas is unwavering as is India as is Vietnam, as is Taiwan. So, we're quite sanguine about the mid-term as well as the long-term, right. We think if we do our job correctly and have the rights environmental bonafides and the right economic value proposition it is decades and decades and decades of runway.\nZach Davis: And Jeremy, I have to say from an operational excellence perspective, I'm so proud of the two sites both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi. They have performed well above my expectations and that team continues to impress me. So, I -- it's more than just market prices. It's you have to make the product and deliver the product.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That makes sense. That's helpful there. And then maybe just pivoting towards CCL Stage 3 here, just wondering if you could refresh us with the recent term deals that you've signed up here, as far as where I guess contracting stands relative to FID moving forward and just kind of updated thoughts on how you think that could progress over the course of this year.\nJack Fusco: Sure. So, we mentioned in the prepared remarks that we think it's around a 3 million tons, but in terms of how these new contracts that we've signed, helped us build Stage 3. I think you have to just realize at this point. The company's commercial and financing strategy is no longer just on an isolated or separate project finance basis, because at this point we're a 45 million ton operating company in the next few months. So, it's all one portfolio and everything helps us from up, not just the existing nine trains, but this next 10-plus million tons in Stage 3. And keep in mind, at this point with the work that the Anatol and the team have done, we have seven at least publicly announced long-term contracts are over 7 million tons and that's TPC, ENN, Glencore, and the three IPM deals with the Apache, EOG and Tourmaline. So, we're getting close but at this point, some of those contracts maybe a couple we'll end up at Sabine, the rest will be perfectly able to underpin the financing, the economics thresholds that we required FID Stage 3 next year.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's a helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nOperator: Next, we will go to Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nSpiro Dounis: Thanks, operator. Good morning, team. I wanted to start off with the MLP actually, if we could and just revisit your thinking there, the valuation spread is really kind of move closer in favor of maybe combining the entities. And I know that was discussed maybe a year or two ago, and it seems like we're gravitating closer that level. So, just want to get your latest views on whether or not we're getting close. I know cash flow accretion was a big point that you wanted to sort of make there. And what your appetite is on that front to simplify the structure?\nZach Davis: Hey, this is Zach again. And I'll just say it -- we've been very consistent in our openness and simplifying the structure over the years. And at the same time, we're pretty happy being patient and waiting for the right ratio of the stocks. But at this point, we don't see any need to do anything to an extent, two-week, two months ago, we came out with capital allocation instead, we had about $10 billion of available cash just with the curves and the momentum we have, that's maybe $2 billion higher. So, there's nothing holding us back from achieving all of our goals, regardless of the structure and definitely not interested in using any leverage to solve any of the accretion dilution issues with such an exchange or an IDR simplification of that sort. But what we're mainly focused on for the LNG shareholders is at least the $11 of run rate cash flow for nine trains growing to $16 on a sustainable basis. And if there's a way to simplify the structure and maintain that yes, we'd be open to it, but at this point we're pretty content with how things are going.\nSpiro Dounis: Yes, makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the update there, Zach. Second question a few weeks ago, you all got approval from the FERC to expand some of the nameplate capacity at Sabine and Corpus. And I just wanted to dig in there a little bit and find out exactly what that relates to. I think some of my math suggested that gets you sort of beyond the optimized 5 million ton per annum run rate for each of those trains. But I realized there might be some nuance there. So, I just want to get some color there and understand if there's anything incremental in that, that approval.\nZach Davis: Yes. That approval was in the making for a while and went through all of the necessary regulatory processes, but I'll tell you. I am more and more pleased with our debottlenecking and optimization that we program that we've been able to do at the two sites. And if you're asking -- if I think there's more room to go, I do and we'll be sure to under promise and over-deliver on that aspect of it.\nSpiro Dounis: Perfect. That's all I had. Thanks for the time guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Reynolds with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrian Reynolds: Hi, good morning, everyone. Just given the 2022 guidance range and comments in the previous capital allocation announcement of $1 billion to $2 billion in additional cash available, I know you just said that could be $1 billion to $2 billion higher on Spiro's response. I'm just wondering how we should think about capital allocation as we head into 2022, any of that excess cash will be deployed in 2022, or if that will be more of a 2023 and 2024 of them. Thanks\nJack Fusco: Sure. So, yes, when we speak to around $2 billion more of available cash through 2024, that don't really come over the span of the entire period of time, because just in this 2022 to 2024 timeframe, let's say margins have moved up over $3. So, just take that into account with a company that's 90% contracted that's how you almost get there in terms of overall cash. What you'll see us do with this momentum though is to an extent, we'll probably pay down more than $1 billion of debt just this year in our first year of capital allocation, but then you can see meaningful increases next year and not just that paydown, but allocations to the buyback program. And obviously some flexibility to not only FID Stage 3 at some point in the middle of next year or later, but even do some LNTP to start locking in prices and some of the schedule earlier in the year. So there's a ton of flexibility there. The main tailwind from this extra cash flow, I see as we came out saying that we hope to get to IG by 2024, it's looking like we'll be able to pay down that $4 billion of debt by 2023. And with that, obviously we can ramp down the amount of debt pay down. We'll be doing posts getting to IG, and that means we can ramp up some of those capital returns while still funding Stage 3. So, you could see us being even more aggressive on the buybacks eventually. And then obviously reconsider what the right payout ratio is for the dividend over time.\nBrian Reynolds: Appreciate the color. To pivot back just to the 150 TBtu of open capacity, just want to clarify, does that include all of Train 6 capacity at this time. I'm assuming late 1Q start date. And then also you talked about the debottlenecking initiatives. I think one to two mtpa on the capital allocation day. Is that also included the guidance or is that kind of vetted through the three years just continued optimization?\nJack Fusco: Yes, when we give guidance today for next year, that's literally the budget that we just went through and the forecasted plan. So, there's no debottlenecking work that needs to get done to achieve our plan for next year, which is over 2200 TBtu, and that's not including any commissioning cargo. So, the production related to Train 6 that should gear up later this year and obviously in Q1 next year. And just to give you some perspective on that commissioning, because it's turning on at pretty good time with where market prices are. We could have over 10 commissioning cargoes over the winter, and that alone could be over a half a billion dollars of extra cash, not baked into any of our forecasts for EBITDA or DCF. And to put in perspective what that number means to finish Train 6 and the third berth at Sabine that's around $300 million. So, we actually are more than covered for the best of our CapEx for the nine train program.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. I'll leave it there. Have a great day, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lapides: Hey, guys, thank you for taking my questions. Congrats on a strong year. I want to think longer term, and I think the first thing is when you're talking to customers and many of your customers are the utility customers in Asia own very diverse power generation fleets. We've seen a ramp in [indiscernible] this year, probably early next year, although pricing could move things around. What are folks saying to you when you talk to them about whether there is a potential coal power plant retirement cycle ahead? Probably not in the next year or two given what's happened, but thinking 5, 10, 15 years down the road in Asia and how material that could be -- if I kind of want to think and compare it to the U.S. and European once?\nZach Davis: Yes. Thank you, Michael. So, I'll start and then I'll turn it over to Anatol. As you know, just in China alone, there's over a 1,000 gigawatts of coal fire generation currently in operation. And I always relate that back to Calpine and when I ran that company, it was around 25,000 or 25 gigawatts and China's got over a 1,000 gigawatts of coal, so just a dramatic number that is multiples of Cheniere's, if they really need reliable supply of natural gas, like we believe they do. I actually think the demand for NatGas and for LNG has been constrained because of the lack of availability of the product. Had we had more product, the demand would've just been in double digits, significantly higher. So, I worry at these high prices, there's a lot of substitution going on and that tends to be a lot more coal and oil being used for power generation. So, we need to get back in balance, longer-term. And then I think folks will actually appreciate that NatGas is here to stay. And part of the solution for cleaner energy mix around the world.\nAnatol Feygin: Yes, Michael. Just to add a little bit to Zach's comments, China is committed to peak coal. It is still adding coal capacity, but it is retiring older plants and that will -- we expect only accelerate the numbers you're seeing now are really just the start of a power conversion to natural gas. It's still only 4% of total power, capacity in China is natural gas, but we're seeing, especially in the coastal provinces, more and more commitment to that with thousands of gigawatts being added. And it's not just coal, it's commitment to phase out nuclear in Taiwan, in Korea going forward. It is probably peak nuclear in Japan, in the coming years. So, we're seeing natural gas still an unwavering commitment to natural gas. Jack mentioned the high prices and the volatility that could cause a recalibration of those commitments. We haven't seen that yet. And as long as again, we do our job of providing stable, affordable, and reliable supplies with almost perfect reliability to our customers. Their economics are of course well within these prompt prices. So, that's clearly helpful in the equation over the longer term.\nMichael Lapides: So if I wanted to think about a really long term outlook for Cheniere, can you remind us how much real estate or how many incremental tons you could potentially add after Stage 3, meaning how much real estate at Corpus is still available and are you even thinking about the Stage 4 at this point?\nZach Davis: Yes, and yes, so we just finished our acquisition of the old Sherwin Alumina facility. That's contiguous to Corpus Christi. So, it's a little over 500 acres and it contains a berth. We believe we could probably add another four large trains, which would be about 20 million tons of additional liquifaction after Stage 3. And then as you know, Michael, we're just completing, we will complete next year berth 3 at Sabine Pass. So, again, we -- I guess it Sabine, it's a long term lease a 99 year land lease. But it's another 500 acres and plenty of room to grow at Sabine, especially with the third berth being completed. It eliminates one of the bottlenecks for us.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, guys, much appreciated.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.\nCraig Shere: Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. It seems like there's really a lot of unrestricted cash at the MLP, I believe CQPs operating cash flow less distributions and even CapEx was positive in 3Q. And to Jack's point, commissioning cargos alone should be more than the cost of all remaining [SPL T-plus] [Ph] CapEx. Any thoughts about applying excess MLP liquidity towards a further train upsizing and or carbon sequestration and would FID on Sabine Train 7, make sense at all before you reconcile simplification and cost of capital issues?\nJack Fusco: Yes. So, Craig, first -- this is Jack, first in our guidance, we fund all the capital projects that we need at Sabine. And in that funding is a continued effort to do the necessary engineer and design work for CCS for Sabine Pass. Additionally as Zach said, we don't feel constrained with the MLP structure to not continue to expand and grow that facility. So, you should expect us to continue to want to leverage all of the infrastructure that we have there, which could include building a Train 7.\nZach Davis: And Craig, I'll just add. Though you see about a $1.7 billion of cash on the balance sheet at CQP about $500 million of that was just the bond proceeds from the CQP bond we did in September that actually paid off the previous debt on October 1. So, there was an incremental $500 million on the books, an incremental $500 million of debt that went away October 1. And on top of that with this excess cash, we're already going to pay over $400 million down of the SBO bond. That's coming due in '22 through our capital allocation. So, we're taking advantage of it there. And then we're increasing into over $3 on the DPU making that commitment today for next year. So, the money is putting, is being put to use for sure, and again, we bake in quite a bit of development capital to ensure that we're progressing Sabine, maintaining Sabine, and setting ourselves up for some opportunities for expansion or for CQP.\nCraig Shere: Thanks. And for my last question, I'm just a little confused about '22 hedges, in that, they could arguably be thought to be weighted more towards first quarter, given proximity and desire to have recent very high pricing, or could be more weighted towards the remainder of the year, given uncertainties around actual T6 timing. Could you kind of walk us through how that kind of ratably moves through the year in terms of hedging?\nZach Davis: You probably know the answer that we're not going to walk you through that in much detail. And I think we actually give quite a bit of detail here today, that we have 150 TBtu open. But, and then you can bake that into how the fact that we are already 90% or so contracted going into this year with all of our long term contracts. But to get to this almost 95%, that is a little bit of hedging. That's just forward sales that we normally do. And there's a bridging volumes for some of the long term deals that are in place as well, like ENN. So, it's a little a mixture of everything. I will say more of the open capacity over time is in the last three quarters of the year versus the first quarter. And that's just because we'll be ramping up Train 6 during that period of time.\nCraig Shere: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBen Nolan: Hey, thanks. I wanted to go back to Corpus Christi a little bit sounds like things are very, very close to Stage 3 going FID, and Jack appreciate the color that you gave the four more large trains and 20 million tons, but not wanting to put the cart before the horse here, but just in terms of the, the timing of the process from where we sit now, what is at least realistic or practical in terms of thinking about okay, well, when do we move on to the next thing past Stage 3? And when does that actually could become operational?\nZach Davis: Ben, right now, we are 100% focused on Stage 3. So, I don't want to divert our attention onto any further growth until I get Stage 3 up and built or at least commercialized. So, the thought that we would sit on our haunches after Stage 3 is interesting to me because as you know, about a 100% of the gas at Corpus Christi right now is currently coming out of the Permian basin. And we are a good credit and a good buyer and a reliable customer of producers to take that gas and convert it and sell it to the global markets. So, we're pretty excited about it. The other aspect of this is probably one of the most transparent industries I've ever been in, to where when we make the filing, you all will know about it, it'll be filed publicly and on a docket and reviewed. And so, you'll have four warning that we've shifted gears.\nBen Nolan: Right? Well, and I was going to see if I could get a little four warning there, I guess. But the next question, it actually, it does relate to Stage 3. I've seen in other places, some things actually already with numbers above 10 million tons being sort of quoted in terms of its capacity. You talked about debottlenecking on the first nine trains, but are you starting to get more confident already that you were conservative on the 10 million tons for Stage 3?\nJack Fusco: Yes. We like to do things with a full wrap. So, and Bechtel will guarantee, the performance as well as the budget and the schedule and for them to get comfortable with the guarantee they're going to darn well, make sure they can meet or exceed that number. And our permit though is for 11.5 million tons just to give you some insight.\nBen Nolan: Perfect. No, that's helpful. I appreciate it. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Webber with Webber Research. Please go ahead.\nMike Webber: Good morning, guys. How are you?\nJack Fusco: Good, Mike, how are you?\nMike Webber: Good. I know we spent a bunch of time this morning already talking about a medium term pricing and CMI, but my primary question is for Anatol. And just curious if you can give some color around whether or not you all have been able to actually start to push six pricing yet? We've heard feedback across different parts of the space that you're starting to see people start to inch up SBA pricing, and just curious on your end, have you been able to do that yet, or is that something we'd expect for an expansion?\nAnatol Feygin: We -- the answer is for us to maximize value for ourselves and to come up with a solution that is attractive to our customers. So, in today's environment, the most attractive way to bridge that is to have a product that's differentiated that has these early volumes. And as we touched on earlier, those volumes are priced at the curve. So, the economics are influenced by those molecules that are in '22, '23, '24 and that has been moving prices for long-term commitments higher as a result. So, that's clearly playing out and we're on the beneficiary end of that. But that says we're perfectly -- we're perfectly content with having an MPV neutral solution that allows our customers to put that into the long-term commitment that they are making to us.\nJack Fusco: And it depends, Mike, right on what -- which parts of the value chain they want, if they want us to deliver it to their dock, then shipping is a pretty critical and valuable component of that transaction. So, at the market, the market's competitive.\nMike Webber: And since then, you guys obviously you've executed your butts off, and Zach and his team have been able to really drive down your cost of capital, but to replicate those kind of per unit returns, being able to drive that SBA price up probably more difficult now than it was in 2011 to 2015. But I guess to the extent that having that a little, I'm trying to get a little bit more, a little sense of -- on a relative basis or love on an absolute basis, but to what degree, you're actually able to leverage those immediate CMI volumes actually drive that CMI or that SDA price back closer to the mid-2s or into the high-2s or even beyond 3, where you were in kind of 2011 to 2015, I think some context there and some sense of scale in terms of what you think is realistic as we head into what should be a pretty decent period between now and say the middle of the decade.\nJack Fusco: So Mike, I'll say this, I think you will be pleasantly surprised when you see the financial metrics when we FID Stage 3 and it's a combination of everything. So, we get paid a premium for reliable -- for being a reliable producer. We get paid a premium for handling, shipping and marketing, and all of that adds up to a very nice price back net back to us. And it works its way through CMI, because that's where all of our skills and our people are that handle that for us. But at the end of the day, it's a combination of all of the above. If you're asking for the plain vanilla FOB CP contract it's very competitive.\nMike Webber: Right, yes. I guess I want to ask you, is that premium, whether that's widened out to any degree, and if I think about the valuation that's predicated on that kind of vanilla, that's a negative price point.\nJack Fusco: It's absolutely widened out shipping is at an all time high. And as you know, the Panama is congested. So, it takes a lot longer to get to Asia. Then shipping prices are a lot higher, so it all translates into higher overall prices.\nMike Webber: Right, right. Okay, great. I'll follow-up offline. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our final question from Sean Morgan with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nSean Morgan: Hey, thanks for taking the question, guys. So, I noticed early in the call, I talked about the hedges, primarily being non-cash and in the press release, you talked a little bit about how the IPMs tend to have a higher amount of hedging associated with them. So, I was kind of wondering just structurally aside from the longer duration and the international pricing, is there anything that's driving that and what percentage of the hedges that we saw being flowing through the income statement. This quarter were related to the new IPM business versus kind of the more historical business that you guys run?\nZach Davis: Sure. So, this is Zach, and I'll just say on total derivatives, we had a $3.5 billion loss on an unrealized basis. So, anything forward-looking non-cash it was $3.1 billion. And on the IPM transactions alone, which is literally just three deals with Apache, EOG and Tourmaline, and Tourmaline started in Q3. At least we signed it in Q3. That was $2.5 billion. So, just to put it -- Yes, into perspective how big that is, and the reason for it is that they actually have to look out the entire length of that contract. And it's treated almost like a regular hedge, because instead of buying gas at Henry Hub, we're buying it at Gulf Coast LNG net back less our fixed fee. And every quarter where margins improved like they had a going from two -- like over $10 now and expanding even in the outer years, it makes the big move. Honestly, we kind of joke here. We hope to never see a major unrealized derivative gain because we'll have the opposite of what we're seeing in the market these days and going forward.\nSean Morgan: Okay. That's interesting. And then just really quickly one follow-up, so I noticed the margin deposits were broken out and it went up and its pretty small relative to the massive company built, but I'm just wondering, is that indicative of any stress customers with these kinds of high spot prices we're seeing in terms of their liquidity and you guys requiring more in the way of bank lender credits, or how did those margin deposits sort of function?\nZach Davis: In terms of margin requirements, clearly when we do a little hedging, we don't go all out all that far, but we did some hedging even going into next year. So, those are some of the unrealized derivative losses. Cash collateral is often called for those; some of the unrealized derivative losses. Cash collateral is often called for those. But at the same time, we have like 15 or so, if not more is the counterparties on hedging and have hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of open credit there. And then, as you could see in our balance sheet, when we talk about over $2 billion cash, untapped, revolvers everywhere, it was a pretty minimal move for the overall company. And that that's how we like it. And that's honestly why we prefer these long-term deals on a Henry Hub plus basis. There's no cash collateral and we lock in the cash flows for even longer periods of time.\nSean Morgan: Okay. That's great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference back to the management team for any final remarks.\nJack Fusco: Hi, this is Jack. I just want to say thank you again for all of your support. It's exciting times for us at Cheniere and we look forward to a strong finish in 2021, and a great start to 2022. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8. As Jack just mentioned, we maintain an increasingly constructive view of the global LNG markets for the balance of this year and well into 2022. Higher demand for our product driven by the need to replenish gas and LNG storage inventories after the cold winter last year, coupled with higher year-on-year demand due to improved economic activity around the world resulted in a significant run-up in prices through the summer. Because of this imbalanced market, we've witnessed unprecedented price spikes across all gas and LNG benchmarks. Global natural gas and LNG prices remain above seasonal norms starting concerns about sustained tightness in LNG supplies ahead of a potentially colder than normal winter once again. TTF settled September at over $15/MMBtu and touched an all-time high of $55/MMBtu in early October. JKM settled October at over $19/MMBtu and hit a new intraday all-time high of over $56/MMBtu in October after averaging around $4/MMBtu in 2020. While our long-term customers are largely insulated from these dramatic price swings and our CMI business can capitalize on these dislocations in the short term. Sustain market volatility could be disruptive for industry as it potentially incentivizes end use customers to utilize cheaper, higher polluting fuels in the short-term. The rapid economic recovery in key LNG markets paired with some of the structural factors impacting Europe and Latin America helped the LNG market achieve higher growth levels this year. LNG consumption increased 7% in the third quarter and made intense competition for supplies between the Atlantic and Pacific basins. This tug of war has certainly exposed the supply constraints facing the industry in the wake of the pandemic. Global LNG supplies grew 8.7 million tons year-over-year in the third quarter, while exports from the U.S. grew approximately 10.7 million tons during the same period. The consistent gains in U.S. exports have been instrumental in providing much needed supplies to the market, offsetting the declines from legacy facilities. In fact, 28 million tons of new LNG capacity, most of which is U.S.-based has come to the market in the past two years, which has more than offset the approximately 19 million ton decline in production from legacy plants in the same time period. This new supply has played a critical role in alleviating some of the global supply shortage while helping mitigate some of the underlying volatility. Let's turn to Slide 9, having covered the supply side of the equation, let's now look at some of the demand side factors driving the markets sustained imbalanced through the third quarter, as mentioned demand in some key Asian markets has been driven by end user buying in order to refill storage ahead of winter, in many cases bidding volume away from Europe. Weather has also played a meaningful role in volumes during the third quarter with severe droughts in Latin America earlier this summer and last year in China, having reduced the availability of hydroelectric power generation sources, increasing demand for gas and further exacerbating the seasonal storage deficit. In Latin America, for example, third quarter demand was up over 100% compared to last year, primarily from the traditional hydro markets of Brazil and Argentina. These factors coupled with efforts to replenish supply levels ahead of winter, intensified the inter basin competition with Asia for incremental LNG volumes throughout the third quarter. In Asia, China's LNG imports increased 13% in the third quarter and made significant growth in the power and city gas sectors, as the focus on switching to cleaner burning fuels continues to grow. China's gas fire power demand increased 23% on the year and its city gas demand grew 18% year-over-year, resulting in widespread power rationing in October in mid gas and coal supply shortages. In South Korea, nuclear outages in July and August also boosted demand for gas fire power generation by approximately 25%, leading to a 58% increase in LNG imports year-over-year in the third quarter, as this impact was incremental to higher demand from replenishing low gas storage inventories. In Europe, storage levels remained at multi-year lows around 22 BCM below the five-year average. The perfect storm or unfortunate combination of lower LNG imports, lack of wind in the North Sea and low incremental pipeline supplies from Russia, coupled with rising coal and carbon prices have driven gas prices in Europe to record highs. Despite having been responsible for balancing the market for much of the pandemic Europe relinquish volumes to more price inelastic markets in Asia and Latin America with LNG imports lower by 19% year-over-year in the third quarter, as illustrated in the chart on the lower right-hand side of the slide. While U.S. LNG imports to the region during the third quarter were up 97% versus the third quarter last year and 76% versus 2019. The strong call on U.S. supplies to meet regional demand in Asia and Latin America meant that U.S. LNG exports to Asia rose 215% versus pre-pandemic levels of 2019. And those to Latin America climbed 52%. These regions sends very strong buy signals to attract higher U.S. flows in an effort to avoid shortages due to fewer pipe gas alternatives and constraints on coal and hydropower availability. Please turn to the next slide. The market significant volatility in the last 18 months has unquestionably placed a strain on energy systems around the world, signaling the need for additional investment in new LNG capacity. As discussed previously, we've expected the market to tighten starting this year due to the historically low volume of FIDs taken between 2015 and 2018, despite the substantial growth in global demand forecasted across developed and developing regions, which is driven by the structural shift to natural gas, as we've discussed on these calls for several years. Based on our assessment of the markets, the FIDs taken back in 2011 through 2014, contributed to a softer market from 2015 through 2020 as the market digested the rapid addition of significant new supply. But the market has not reached a cyclical inflection point and it's calling for new capacity to be added, while much of the current tightness has been exacerbated by confluence of short-term factors, impacting supply and demand. We do expect the underlying markets to remain tighter as a result of the pandemic, which reset the supply cycle and forced companies to employ stricter capital allocation parameters and deferred many project FIDs. We now estimate that this tight market could extend well through 2025 and potentially tighter seasonal swings over the midterm period, especially for production from legacy plans remains in elastic and the current constraints on the coal supply cycle persist. Recall that, just last year stakeholders in our industry were more concerned about security of demand than security of supply. That perspective has certainly been reset by the current market conditions, which we believe create tailwinds for long-term contracting of reliable and affordable LNG sources like our Corpus Christi Stage 3. Our plan to expand our Corpus Christi facility is part and parcel of our strategy to invest in accretive growth projects that deliver value to our shareholders and provide flexible, reliable LNG supply for our customers. And we believe the visibility on price certainty that's central to the structure of our long-term contracts will be increasingly attractive to LNG buyers under current market conditions. You're beginning to see this manifest in the market with long-term contracting activity, clearly increasing the last few months. As Jack mentioned, we're very excited about our newest long-term customers, ENN and Glencore and look forward to building on this momentum as we continue to commercialize our growing platform. The meaningful engagement we're having with both existing and prospective customers, gives us great confidence that we're marketing solutions valued by the market, and we expect to maintain that commercial momentum into next year and reach FID on Stage 3. The current market volatility coupled with the environmental and economic attributes of our product lead us to remain quite sanguine about the critical role LNG and natural gas have in the global energy market, both as a destination fuel as well as a key enabler in the global transition to lower carbon energy sources. Thank you all for your time. I'll now turn the call over to Zach who will review our financial results and guidance. My turn? All right, thanks, Jack. Good morning, Christine. The -- so, as Zach mentioned, we -- the market for those midterm transactions is the market. So, we reserve them as volumes for the origination efforts we think having the right solutions, the flexibility to start volumes without a condition precedent start them before additional capacity comes on is all very important, and has been a key differentiator for us. So, those volumes are blended into the contract either commercially or the way we account for them, either way. But in the font for the liquid part of the curve, we include those economics in that long-term transaction on an [MPV] [Ph] neutral basis to us. So, that's very important to us. And as you've seen with ENN, Glencore, and others that maybe you haven't seen explicitly, that that's a key differentiator. And we will earn that curve over the life of the deal. Yes. Like we said, this was supposed to be, to us, a transition year that was difficult to call. And everything that we've talked about has created a much more rapid transition. And as you said, that the volumes that are coming into the market '22 through '25, delays on upstream FIDs, delays on liquefaction FIDs, some of both actually being cancelled, as you've seen in recent history, gets us well through the mid 20s. And on the demand side, we just see a continued commitment to natural gas. I mean you see these numbers out of China which is, through tree quarters, is the leading market. It's surpassed Japan, it's about two million tons higher now on the year, most likely will be the largest market. And we don't see that market slowing down. And its commitment to natural gas is unwavering as is India as is Vietnam, as is Taiwan. So, we're quite sanguine about the mid-term as well as the long-term, right. We think if we do our job correctly and have the rights environmental bonafides and the right economic value proposition it is decades and decades and decades of runway. Yes, Michael. Just to add a little bit to Zach's comments, China is committed to peak coal. It is still adding coal capacity, but it is retiring older plants and that will -- we expect only accelerate the numbers you're seeing now are really just the start of a power conversion to natural gas. It's still only 4% of total power, capacity in China is natural gas, but we're seeing, especially in the coastal provinces, more and more commitment to that with thousands of gigawatts being added. And it's not just coal, it's commitment to phase out nuclear in Taiwan, in Korea going forward. It is probably peak nuclear in Japan, in the coming years. So, we're seeing natural gas still an unwavering commitment to natural gas. Jack mentioned the high prices and the volatility that could cause a recalibration of those commitments. We haven't seen that yet. And as long as again, we do our job of providing stable, affordable, and reliable supplies with almost perfect reliability to our customers. Their economics are of course well within these prompt prices. So, that's clearly helpful in the equation over the longer term. We -- the answer is for us to maximize value for ourselves and to come up with a solution that is attractive to our customers. So, in today's environment, the most attractive way to bridge that is to have a product that's differentiated that has these early volumes. And as we touched on earlier, those volumes are priced at the curve. So, the economics are influenced by those molecules that are in '22, '23, '24 and that has been moving prices for long-term commitments higher as a result. So, that's clearly playing out and we're on the beneficiary end of that. But that says we're perfectly -- we're perfectly content with having an MPV neutral solution that allows our customers to put that into the long-term commitment that they are making to us."

            "name": "Jack Fusco",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today, and thank you for your continued support at Cheniere. I'm pleased to be here this morning to review our third quarter results, and our increased financial guidance for 2021, as well as introduce our financial guidance for 2022. We are in the midst of an exciting and pivotal time in the global LNG market as the world continues its transition to a cleaner energy mix. I'm excited about Cheniere's prospects and advantaged position to compete and win in this market for years to come. Before we begin, I'd like to spend a minute discussing Hurricane Ida, a deadly Category 4 hurricane which impacted Louisiana during the third quarter. While the center of the storm made landfall well to the east of our facilities at Sabine Pass, many of our coworkers, neighbors, and other members of the Cheniere family were impacted with lost or damaged homes and property. Once again, I am pleased with Cheniere's response, and I am proud of how quickly and impactfully we supported those in need in the communities where we live and work, in Southwest Louisiana. In addition to providing direct financial assistance to disaster relief organizations, we once again partnered with the Astros Foundation to lead a three-day supply drive, in Houston, led by Cheniere's employee volunteers. We collected, sorted, and loaded six semi trucks with emergency supplies for our neighbors in need in Southwest Louisiana, while many employees from Sabine Pass traveled to the affected communities to help with the cleanup efforts. Fortunately, the Sabine Pass facility was spared by the storm, and we maintain continuous and stable operations throughout the weather event. I'd like to recognize our teams from production, operations, planning, marine operations, gas supply, meteorology, and many others for their tireless effort through this hurricane seasons and demonstrating safety as a core value at Cheniere. Now, please, turn to slide five, where I will review some key operational and financial highlights from the third quarter, as well as introduce our 2022 guidance ranges. For the third quarter, we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion. And for the fourth consecutive quarter, we are raising our full-year 2021 EBITDA guidance. We now forecast 2021 consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $4.6 billion to $5.00 billion. This increase in EBITDA guidance is driven primarily by higher net backs on open volumes due to increased global LNG prices, as well as increased lifting margins driven by higher domestic natural gas prices. While we are currently tracking to the upper end of this upwardly revised range, the specific timing of a few high-value CMI cargos scheduled to be loaded or delivered at the end of the year, which could slip into the beginning of 2022, drives a slightly wider range. Distributable cash flow grew to approximately $390 million. And we are reconfirming distributable cash flow guidance of $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion for 2021. During the quarter, we generated a net loss of approximately $1 billion. As we have discussed in prior quarters, our net income is impacted by the realized and unrealized gains and losses due to the derivative accounting treatment required on our natural gas and LNG hedges, as well as on our long-term integrated production marketing, or IPM, transactions. Zach will discuss the impact on our third quarter results in more detail in a few minutes. Now, looking ahead to 2022, I am pleased, today, to introduce full-year 2022 guidance of $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion of consolidated adjusted EBITDA, and $3.1 billion to $3.6 billion of distributable cash flow, reconfirming that our inflection point has arrived, a guidance range slightly wider than what we've historically provided is necessary due to the higher LNG margins, and considerable volatility in the market today, as well as the specific timing of delivery on some [DES] [Ph] cargo scheduled at or near the end of 2021 and early 2022. We expect the LNG market to remain tight, and to continue to provide a constructive backdrop for our business well into next year. The higher net-backs are complimented by higher expected volumes next year, driven by the substantial completion of Sabine Pass Train 6, expected during the first quarter, as well as the continued execution in our operational excellence program at both of our sites. We are truly excited about what next year holds for Cheniere, and we look forward to, once again, delivering results within the guided ranges. The third quarter was particularly meaningful for our company, as it featured the announcement of our comprehensive long-term all-of-the-above capital allocation strategy, which was enabled by our team's relentless focus on execution and operational excellence, which has placed Cheniere at a decisive cash flow inflection point. Our capital allocation plan centers around three primary principles which include; a strong and sustainable balance sheet, funding financially disciplined growth, and returning significant amounts of capital to our shareholders over time. To achieve these goals, we have committed to paying down on at least $1 billion of debt annually, through 2024, or until we achieve investment-grade credit metrics, declared our inaugural quarterly dividend for the third quarter, reset our $1 billion share repurchase program for the next three years, and laid out a plan to invest in Corpus Christi Stage 3 next year with internally generated cash flow. In line with these plans, we have repaid $750 million of debt across the structure in the first three quarters of 2021. So, we are on pace to meet or exceed the $1 billion target this year. The third quarter was also an extremely productive one for us in terms of operations and execution. And we, once again, achieved milestones across our business. On the production side, for the third quarter, we set a cargo record, this time with 141 cargos of LNG exported from our two facilities. Our production and marine teams at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi have continued to maximize asset availability and LNG production at both facilities, while maintaining our focus on safety. Last month, we reached a significant milestone at Sabine Pass Train 6, when feed gas was introduced for the first time as part of the commissioning process, with the project approximately 97% complete, and substantial completion expected in the first quarter of next year. [Indiscernible] continues to progress against an accelerated schedule, approximately one year ahead of the guaranteed completion date. We look forward to a successful commissioning process. We expect to have the first commissioning cargos around the year-end, and a smooth ramp up of Train 6 to stable operations. During the third quarter, we reinforced our leadership position on climate sustainability with the publication of our peer-reviewed LNG Lifecycle Assessment Study. This study is the first of its kind in the LNG industry, as the analysis utilize greenhouse gas emission data specific to our supply chain, and will therefore enable us to better assess greenhouse gas emissions across our LNG operations. I am proud of the continued progress we have made on this front; across so many different aspects of the company we will continue to integrate climate and sustainability throughout our business to improve environmental transparency and performance. This is especially important given the global focus on the LNG market presently. Barely a year ago, we were in a market environment of low prices, and pandemic-impacted demand. Today, however, it's clear the absolute critical role natural gas and LNG have to play in a global energy transition and the viability of LNG and natural gas as a key source of reliable energy supply for decades to come. Now, turn to slide six, where I'll highlight Cheniere's significant commercial momentum, and the market dynamics supporting our increased financial guidance and confidence in the FID of Corpus Christi Stage 3 in 2022. We kicked off the third quarter with the announcement of our newest long-term IPM contract with a Canadian natural gas producer, Tourmaline. Just after the quarter ended, we announced two long-term SPAs, with ENN and Glencore. The SPAs with ENN and Glencore are approximately 13-year contracts executed with CMI, and done on an FOB basis. The signing of these long-term contracts extends our percent contracted of the nine-train portfolio to over 90% through this decade. And we maintain the flexibility to assign the ENN and Glencore deals to a specific project. Looking ahead, we estimate another three million tons or so is needed to fully sanction Stage 3. And with our origination team, as busy as they are, I'm confident we'll get that required commercial support in the coming quarters. In the short-term market, we have witnessed significant volatility and record prices for LNG and natural gas across the globe, with storage level in key demand centers below historic levels. As we approach the winter season, we expect demand and prices to remain elevated into 2022, which gives us confidence in our guidance for next year. On the long-term side, LNG market fundamentals are as constructive for long-term contracting and the construction of new liquefaction capacity, as I've seen at any point, since I joined Cheniere. Anatol has a lot of good information to share with you in a moment, but we're seeing LNG consumers recognize the importance and the value of securing long-term natural gas supply and price visibility, both of which a contract with Cheniere provides. And we market to those consumers now as the second largest producer of LNG in the world. This is a major competitive advantage, as it demonstrates our ability to execute and fulfill our promises to our customers, something they value significantly in today's market. We are responsible for providing our customers with flexible and reliable energy supply in the size, scale, and hard earn reputation of reliability of the Cheniere platform enables us to be a dependable partner for our customers. In addition, being able to offer flexible solutions that are tailored to the unique needs of our customers is a competitive advantage that is virtually impossible to replicate in the near term. Our commercial momentum coupled with a significant tailwind in the long-term LNG market, underscores our progress towards FID of Corpus Christi Stage 3. While our confidence in 2022 FID grows, we remain committed to our discipline capital investment parameters to ensure the risk and return profile is consistent with that of the first nine trains we built. You've heard me say this before. But it's worth repeating. We aren't in the FID business. We're in the value creation business. With that, I'll turn the call over to Anatol, who will provide more detail around current market dynamics. Thank you, Christine. And we'll have Zach answer the question. Anatol? And, Christine, it's -- Christine, it's -- [technical difficulty]. So, there are some DES deals, there's IPM, there's FOB. It's all of the above, because we participate on the whole value chain. Morning, Jeremy. Sure. So, we mentioned in the prepared remarks that we think it's around a 3 million tons, but in terms of how these new contracts that we've signed, helped us build Stage 3. I think you have to just realize at this point. The company's commercial and financing strategy is no longer just on an isolated or separate project finance basis, because at this point we're a 45 million ton operating company in the next few months. So, it's all one portfolio and everything helps us from up, not just the existing nine trains, but this next 10-plus million tons in Stage 3. And keep in mind, at this point with the work that the Anatol and the team have done, we have seven at least publicly announced long-term contracts are over 7 million tons and that's TPC, ENN, Glencore, and the three IPM deals with the Apache, EOG and Tourmaline. So, we're getting close but at this point, some of those contracts maybe a couple we'll end up at Sabine, the rest will be perfectly able to underpin the financing, the economics thresholds that we required FID Stage 3 next year. Sure. So, yes, when we speak to around $2 billion more of available cash through 2024, that don't really come over the span of the entire period of time, because just in this 2022 to 2024 timeframe, let's say margins have moved up over $3. So, just take that into account with a company that's 90% contracted that's how you almost get there in terms of overall cash. What you'll see us do with this momentum though is to an extent, we'll probably pay down more than $1 billion of debt just this year in our first year of capital allocation, but then you can see meaningful increases next year and not just that paydown, but allocations to the buyback program. And obviously some flexibility to not only FID Stage 3 at some point in the middle of next year or later, but even do some LNTP to start locking in prices and some of the schedule earlier in the year. So there's a ton of flexibility there. The main tailwind from this extra cash flow, I see as we came out saying that we hope to get to IG by 2024, it's looking like we'll be able to pay down that $4 billion of debt by 2023. And with that, obviously we can ramp down the amount of debt pay down. We'll be doing posts getting to IG, and that means we can ramp up some of those capital returns while still funding Stage 3. So, you could see us being even more aggressive on the buybacks eventually. And then obviously reconsider what the right payout ratio is for the dividend over time. Yes, when we give guidance today for next year, that's literally the budget that we just went through and the forecasted plan. So, there's no debottlenecking work that needs to get done to achieve our plan for next year, which is over 2200 TBtu, and that's not including any commissioning cargo. So, the production related to Train 6 that should gear up later this year and obviously in Q1 next year. And just to give you some perspective on that commissioning, because it's turning on at pretty good time with where market prices are. We could have over 10 commissioning cargoes over the winter, and that alone could be over a half a billion dollars of extra cash, not baked into any of our forecasts for EBITDA or DCF. And to put in perspective what that number means to finish Train 6 and the third berth at Sabine that's around $300 million. So, we actually are more than covered for the best of our CapEx for the nine train program. Yes. So, Craig, first -- this is Jack, first in our guidance, we fund all the capital projects that we need at Sabine. And in that funding is a continued effort to do the necessary engineer and design work for CCS for Sabine Pass. Additionally as Zach said, we don't feel constrained with the MLP structure to not continue to expand and grow that facility. So, you should expect us to continue to want to leverage all of the infrastructure that we have there, which could include building a Train 7. Yes. We like to do things with a full wrap. So, and Bechtel will guarantee, the performance as well as the budget and the schedule and for them to get comfortable with the guarantee they're going to darn well, make sure they can meet or exceed that number. And our permit though is for 11.5 million tons just to give you some insight. Good, Mike, how are you? And it depends, Mike, right on what -- which parts of the value chain they want, if they want us to deliver it to their dock, then shipping is a pretty critical and valuable component of that transaction. So, at the market, the market's competitive. So Mike, I'll say this, I think you will be pleasantly surprised when you see the financial metrics when we FID Stage 3 and it's a combination of everything. So, we get paid a premium for reliable -- for being a reliable producer. We get paid a premium for handling, shipping and marketing, and all of that adds up to a very nice price back net back to us. And it works its way through CMI, because that's where all of our skills and our people are that handle that for us. But at the end of the day, it's a combination of all of the above. If you're asking for the plain vanilla FOB CP contract it's very competitive. It's absolutely widened out shipping is at an all time high. And as you know, the Panama is congested. So, it takes a lot longer to get to Asia. Then shipping prices are a lot higher, so it all translates into higher overall prices. Hi, this is Jack. I just want to say thank you again for all of your support. It's exciting times for us at Cheniere and we look forward to a strong finish in 2021, and a great start to 2022. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Zach Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Anatol and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our third quarter financial results and our increased full-year 2021 EBITDA guidance, as well as provide you with some more detail regarding our full-year 2022 guidance. Turning to slide 12, for the third quarter, we generated revenue of approximately $3 billion, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.1 billion, distributable cash flow of approximately $390 million, and a net loss of approximately a billion dollars. Our net income results for the quarter were negatively impacted by the accounting treatment for our realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments, which includes our long-term IPM agreements. As we have discussed in prior quarters, our IPM agreements, certain gas supply agreements and certain forward sales of LNG qualify as derivatives and require mark-to-market accounting, meaning that from period to period, we will experience gains and losses as movements occur in the underlying forward commodity curves. This accounting treatment coupled with the significant volumes, long-term duration and volatility and price basis for certain contracts, and most notably, our IPM agreements will result in fluctuations in fair market value from period to period. By operationally we seek to eliminate commodity risk by matching our natural gas purchases and LNG sales on the same pricing index, our long-term LNG SBAs do not currently qualify for mark-to-market accounting, meaning that the fair market value impact of only one side of the transaction is often recognized on our financial statements until the sale of LNG occurs. The unfavorable pretax impact from changes in the fair value and settlements of our commodity and FX derivatives during third quarter 2021 was approximately $3.5 billion, $3.1 billion of which was non-cash, including approximately $2.5 billion directly related to our IPM deals, which were the primary driver of our recognized net loss for the third quarter. I want to highlight that the impact is substantially all non-cash and tied to the significant volatility we have experienced in the global LNG market, which is otherwise served as a significant tailwind for our businesses from both financial and commercial perspective. The tailwinds are reflected in our increased guidance for 2021 and the 2022 guidance we are rolling out this morning above our normalized run rate ranges. For the third quarter, we recognized an income 499 TBtu of physical LNG, including 489 TBtu from our projects, and 10 TBtu from third parties. Approximately 78% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SBAs or from volumes procured under our IPM agreements. We received no-cargo cancellations and had no impact to revenue recognition timing related to cargo cancellations in the third quarter. As Jack mentioned, we are proud to have announced our long-term comprehensive capital allocation plan in September. Thanks to the success achieved by the Cheniere team over the past five years, we have certainly reached a cash flow inflection point that supports our capital allocation priorities of balance sheet management, financially disciplined growth, and returning capital to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. As you may recall, we initially targeted $500 million of debt reduction this year, which we've exceeded by approximately $250 million through the third quarter alone. In line with our capital allocation plan, year-to-date, we've extended the weighted average maturity of our outstanding debt by over a year, lowered our weighted average borrowing rate by over 15 basis points, reduced the percentage of our outstanding debt that is secured by approximately 10% and lowered our LTM leverage by over a turn. During the third quarter, we issued $750 million of fully amortizing 2.742% public senior secured notes due 2039 at CCH, and used the net proceeds to refinance a portion of the borrowings under the CCH's credit facility due 2024. This transaction the lowest yielding bond ever secured by Cheniere not only extended the maturity of our borrowings, but also better matched our contracted cash flows with the timing of debt repayment. In September, we issued $1.2 billion of 3.25% senior notes due 2032 at CQP. This transaction execute on every aspect of our capital allocation strategy. We use the proceeds to refinance CQP's 5.625% senior notes due 2026 and a portion of the 6.25% senior secured notes due 2022 at SPL were refinanced with the indebtedness migrated to CQP. Not only do we achieve the lowest pricing for a 10-year high yield issuance in energy, we efficiently migrated debt from the projects and further de-secured our consolidated balance sheet. Pro forma for the payment made in October with a portion of the proceeds from the CQP 2032s along with cash on hand, there's approximately $700 million currently remaining on the 2022 SPL notes. We expect to redeem approximately $500 million of this amount via committed long-term amortizing fixed rate notes at SPL. We entered into on a private placement basis, which are expected to be funded this quarter. The remaining approximately $200 million is expected to be paid down with cash flow. In October, we amended our existing $1.25 billion CEI revolving credit facility with 23 financial institutions extending the maturity to 2026 and lowering our borrowing rate. Perhaps most notably, the amended facility includes bespoke ESG loan features that provide economic incentives related to defined ESG milestones. Specifically, these incentives include potential reductions in interest rate and commitment fees for certain sustainability linked expenditures, such as expenses to support our QMRV programs and the achievement of specified climate related milestones like establishing the cargo emissions tags in the coming year. In addition to our progress on managing our maturities during the quarter, we resumed share repurchases under our original share repurchase authorization. In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 77,100 shares for approximately $6 million. Our new three-year $1 billion share repurchase program commenced October 1. Turn now to Slide 13, as previously mentioned, today, we are again increasing our guidance range for full-year 2021 consolidated adjusted EBITDA and reconfirming the range for distributable cash flow. A revised guidance range for 2021 consolidated adjusted EBITDA is $4.6 billion to $5 billion. So, the low end of the range remains unchanged, but we are raising the high end by $100 million. The high end is moving up due mainly to the higher margins we expect to capture on our CMI volume. Though, the low end is staying the same simply due to the variability around the specific delivery dates on a number of high valued DS cargos sold by CMI, which are scheduled to be delivered right around yearend and early next year. We'll earn the EBITDA associated with these cargos either way, but it may end up weighted into 2021 or 2022 depending on the specific logistics of those cargo deliveries. The DCF guidance range for 2021 remains at $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion. While the ranges unchanged, we are now tracking to the high end as the factors moving up our EBITDA forecast are also positively impacting our DCF forecast. While on the subject of DCF, we have made an important update to our financial reporting and guidance with respect to this metric. Starting with 2022 guidance, we have adopted a new definition for distributable cash flow that we believe better reflects the consolidated cash flow of each of our wholly-owned subsidiaries as well as CQP. Currently, without this change, our DCF is calculated based on only distributions declared at CQP, which are impacted by CQP's capital allocation decisions, including debt paydown and capital spend at Sabine Pass. Rather than have capital allocation decisions made at our subsidiaries impact consolidated DCF, we have revised our calculation to properly reflect the consolidated cash flow of the entire Cheniere complex, less amounts attributable to non-controlling interests. The new definition accounts for a 100% of CQP's distributable cash flow being distributed to Cheniere Energy Inc. or said differently assumes a one times coverage ratio at CQP, which will incorporate all cash flow generated in CQP before capital expenditures, retain cash flow, and distributions. Please note this change does not affect our run rate DCF guidance, as we have always assumed a one-times coverage ratio for CQP, and our run rate forecasts to reflect this dynamic. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect to have another outstanding year, and are guiding to $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion of consolidated adjusted EBITDA, and $3.1 billion to $3.6 billion of distributable cash flow. The market today is well above our long-run CMI margin assumption of $2.00 to $2.50, so 2022 should be a landmark year for Cheniere, with all nine trains up and running, and our financial forecast well above our run rate guidance. At CQP, we are forecasting a significant step up in distributions, with guidance ranging from $3.00 to $3.25 per unit. Like our upwardly revised 2021 guidance, our figures for 2022 are largely driven by the continued strength of the LNG market, and our ability to capture higher net backs on our open volumes, which will be higher in 2022 thanks to the accelerated schedule for substantial completion at Sabine Pass Train 6, and continued production optimization at both of our sites. As we enter 2022, we expect to have approximately 150 TBtu of open or unfilled capacity at CMI. Our EBITDA sensitivity to a dollar move in market margins is less than $150 million. While we have assumed some of that 150 TBtu at the current curve, we have also reserved a portion of the open volume strategically as bridging volume, for long-term origination transactions, similar to the ENN and Glencore SPAs. The net volume is therefore marked at prices that blend the near-term curve with the long-term market price. There is a wider guidance range for 2022 than we have provided in previous years due to a number of related factors. Store open capacity for next year is only approximately 7% of our total forecasted P&L production. The higher margins in the market means the EBITDA that each TBtu of LNG contributes is higher, and therefore the impact from each cargo is amplified. In addition, the specific timing of Train 6 substantial completion, as well trajectory of that train reaching stable operations, and the timing of delivery of the CMI cargo scheduled for the very end of this year and early next year, all help justify starting with a slightly wider guidance range than we have historically provided for initial guidance, two months ahead of the year. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions. Hey, Christine. So, we're pretty excited about 2022, will be our first year with nine trains operational. And we should have record production of around 43 million tons for the year or over 2,200 TBtu. So, when you think about 150 TBtu open, that's less than 7% of our total P&L production next year. And then I would say that that open volume is going to contribute, give or take, around $1 billion. And that's after accounting for the fact that though the curve next year is around, let's say, $10.00 or so, we reserved a portion of the cargos of this open capacity for some additional long-term origination deals with bridging volumes similar to how we structured the ENN or Glencore deals. So, that's basically how it's set up. We assume Train 6 is coming online at the end of Q1. And there's some flexibility in there in terms of some of those high-priced LNG cargos. We literally have a couple cargos that are close to almost $100 million of value to us, either being delivered late this year, early next. So, with some flexibility on exactly when substantial completion can occur, and some of that timing, that that just forced us to think about a $500 million range when margins are around that $10.00 versus last year, when we came into the year they were around $0.50, even though we had even more capacity open at the time. And I'll just -- sorry, I was just going to add that it was like literally a year ago we were around 85% contracted as a company, and Jack said the goal was, in the next few years to be 90% contracted. And we're now 90% contracted on the nine-train program through the early 2030s, with all the work that's been done. And with all the deals that we've signed, midterm deals, long-term deals, that Anatol and the commercial team have signed this year, it's over $6 billion of fixed fees, just to give you a sense of how much de-risking has occurred. And Jeremy, I have to say from an operational excellence perspective, I'm so proud of the two sites both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi. They have performed well above my expectations and that team continues to impress me. So, I -- it's more than just market prices. It's you have to make the product and deliver the product. Hey, this is Zach again. And I'll just say it -- we've been very consistent in our openness and simplifying the structure over the years. And at the same time, we're pretty happy being patient and waiting for the right ratio of the stocks. But at this point, we don't see any need to do anything to an extent, two-week, two months ago, we came out with capital allocation instead, we had about $10 billion of available cash just with the curves and the momentum we have, that's maybe $2 billion higher. So, there's nothing holding us back from achieving all of our goals, regardless of the structure and definitely not interested in using any leverage to solve any of the accretion dilution issues with such an exchange or an IDR simplification of that sort. But what we're mainly focused on for the LNG shareholders is at least the $11 of run rate cash flow for nine trains growing to $16 on a sustainable basis. And if there's a way to simplify the structure and maintain that yes, we'd be open to it, but at this point we're pretty content with how things are going. Yes. That approval was in the making for a while and went through all of the necessary regulatory processes, but I'll tell you. I am more and more pleased with our debottlenecking and optimization that we program that we've been able to do at the two sites. And if you're asking -- if I think there's more room to go, I do and we'll be sure to under promise and over-deliver on that aspect of it. Yes. Thank you, Michael. So, I'll start and then I'll turn it over to Anatol. As you know, just in China alone, there's over a 1,000 gigawatts of coal fire generation currently in operation. And I always relate that back to Calpine and when I ran that company, it was around 25,000 or 25 gigawatts and China's got over a 1,000 gigawatts of coal, so just a dramatic number that is multiples of Cheniere's, if they really need reliable supply of natural gas, like we believe they do. I actually think the demand for NatGas and for LNG has been constrained because of the lack of availability of the product. Had we had more product, the demand would've just been in double digits, significantly higher. So, I worry at these high prices, there's a lot of substitution going on and that tends to be a lot more coal and oil being used for power generation. So, we need to get back in balance, longer-term. And then I think folks will actually appreciate that NatGas is here to stay. And part of the solution for cleaner energy mix around the world. Yes, and yes, so we just finished our acquisition of the old Sherwin Alumina facility. That's contiguous to Corpus Christi. So, it's a little over 500 acres and it contains a berth. We believe we could probably add another four large trains, which would be about 20 million tons of additional liquifaction after Stage 3. And then as you know, Michael, we're just completing, we will complete next year berth 3 at Sabine Pass. So, again, we -- I guess it Sabine, it's a long term lease a 99 year land lease. But it's another 500 acres and plenty of room to grow at Sabine, especially with the third berth being completed. It eliminates one of the bottlenecks for us. And Craig, I'll just add. Though you see about a $1.7 billion of cash on the balance sheet at CQP about $500 million of that was just the bond proceeds from the CQP bond we did in September that actually paid off the previous debt on October 1. So, there was an incremental $500 million on the books, an incremental $500 million of debt that went away October 1. And on top of that with this excess cash, we're already going to pay over $400 million down of the SBO bond. That's coming due in '22 through our capital allocation. So, we're taking advantage of it there. And then we're increasing into over $3 on the DPU making that commitment today for next year. So, the money is putting, is being put to use for sure, and again, we bake in quite a bit of development capital to ensure that we're progressing Sabine, maintaining Sabine, and setting ourselves up for some opportunities for expansion or for CQP. You probably know the answer that we're not going to walk you through that in much detail. And I think we actually give quite a bit of detail here today, that we have 150 TBtu open. But, and then you can bake that into how the fact that we are already 90% or so contracted going into this year with all of our long term contracts. But to get to this almost 95%, that is a little bit of hedging. That's just forward sales that we normally do. And there's a bridging volumes for some of the long term deals that are in place as well, like ENN. So, it's a little a mixture of everything. I will say more of the open capacity over time is in the last three quarters of the year versus the first quarter. And that's just because we'll be ramping up Train 6 during that period of time. Ben, right now, we are 100% focused on Stage 3. So, I don't want to divert our attention onto any further growth until I get Stage 3 up and built or at least commercialized. So, the thought that we would sit on our haunches after Stage 3 is interesting to me because as you know, about a 100% of the gas at Corpus Christi right now is currently coming out of the Permian basin. And we are a good credit and a good buyer and a reliable customer of producers to take that gas and convert it and sell it to the global markets. So, we're pretty excited about it. The other aspect of this is probably one of the most transparent industries I've ever been in, to where when we make the filing, you all will know about it, it'll be filed publicly and on a docket and reviewed. And so, you'll have four warning that we've shifted gears. Sure. So, this is Zach, and I'll just say on total derivatives, we had a $3.5 billion loss on an unrealized basis. So, anything forward-looking non-cash it was $3.1 billion. And on the IPM transactions alone, which is literally just three deals with Apache, EOG and Tourmaline, and Tourmaline started in Q3. At least we signed it in Q3. That was $2.5 billion. So, just to put it -- Yes, into perspective how big that is, and the reason for it is that they actually have to look out the entire length of that contract. And it's treated almost like a regular hedge, because instead of buying gas at Henry Hub, we're buying it at Gulf Coast LNG net back less our fixed fee. And every quarter where margins improved like they had a going from two -- like over $10 now and expanding even in the outer years, it makes the big move. Honestly, we kind of joke here. We hope to never see a major unrealized derivative gain because we'll have the opposite of what we're seeing in the market these days and going forward. In terms of margin requirements, clearly when we do a little hedging, we don't go all out all that far, but we did some hedging even going into next year. So, those are some of the unrealized derivative losses. Cash collateral is often called for those; some of the unrealized derivative losses. Cash collateral is often called for those. But at the same time, we have like 15 or so, if not more is the counterparties on hedging and have hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of open credit there. And then, as you could see in our balance sheet, when we talk about over $2 billion cash, untapped, revolvers everywhere, it was a pretty minimal move for the overall company. And that that's how we like it. And that's honestly why we prefer these long-term deals on a Henry Hub plus basis. There's no cash collateral and we lock in the cash flows for even longer periods of time."

At this time, I would turn the conference over to Randy Bhatia, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead.\nRandy Bhatia: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Cheniere\u2019s second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. The slide presentation and access to the webcast for today\u2019s call are available at cheniere.com. Joining me this morning are Jack Fusco, Cheniere\u2019s President and CEO; Anatol Feygin, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Zach Davis, Senior Vice President and CFO. Before we begin, I would like to remind all listeners that our remarks, including answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. And actual results could differ materially from what is described in these statements. Slide 2 of our presentation contains a discussion of those forward-looking statements and associated risks. In addition, we may include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the appendix to the slide presentation. As part of our discussion of Cheniere\u2019s results, today\u2019s call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP or CQP. We do not intend to cover CQP\u2019s results separately from those of Cheniere Energy Inc. The call agenda is shown on Slide 3. Jack will begin with operating and financial highlights, Anatol will then provide an update on the LNG market and Zach will review our financial results and guidance. After prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jack Fusco, Cheniere\u2019s President and CEO.\nJack Fusco: Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today and thank you for your continued support at Cheniere. I\u2019m pleased to be here this morning to review our results from the second quarter and our increased financial guidance for the full year of 2021. Please turn to Slide 5, where I will review some key operational financial highlights from the second quarter. The second quarter was an extremely productive one for us. As we achieved milestones across the enterprise and origination, marketing, operations and engineering and construction just to name a few. Global LNG market fundamentals continue to be extremely constructive and we have begun to see the return of long-term LNG contracts in support of the construction of new liquefaction capacity. For the second quarter, we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $1.023 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $340 million on revenue of over $3 billion. We generated a net loss of approximately $329 million due primarily to the unrealized derivative accounting treatment required on our hedges and on our integrated production marketing or IPM transactions, which is Zach will discuss in more detail in a few minutes. For the third consecutive quarter, we\u2019re raising our full year 2021 financial guidance. We now forecast 2021 consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion. This increase in guidance is being driven by a number of factors. First, the continued strengthening of the LNG market is yielding higher net backs unopened volumes. For context, since our first quarter earnings call in May spot margins for 2021 doubled and our portfolio optimization team has been able to capitalize on that with our open volumes. In addition, we\u2019ve been able to further unlock some additional production for the second half of the year, primarily through maintenance optimization, which has contributed to an upwardly revised production forecast. And lastly, with Henry Hub moving higher over the past quarter, we make some additional lifting margin. So our outlook for the balance of 2021 has improved again based on a very strong LNG market and our very strong operational performance. The fundamentals present in the LNG market are as good or better than at any time since I\u2019ve been at Cheniere. Anatol will cover the market in more detail in a few minutes. Our market dynamics on both the supply side and demand side continue to move in our favor and support our conviction in the long-term growth prospects for natural gas worldwide. Just after the quarter ended, we signed our third IPM agreement in support of Corpus Christi Stage 3, this time with Tourmaline, the largest natural gas producer in Canada. This transaction progresses our commercialization efforts on a shovel-ready Stage 3 expansion project, and helps validate our view of a constructive macro backdrop for long-term contracts. In addition, it reinforces Cheniere\u2019s record of executing collaborative, innovative solutions to meet the needs of our customers. We will continue to leverage our infrastructure platform and commercial advantages to further progress Stage 3 towards FID. During the second quarter, we continue to have meaningful success under our mid-term strategy, placing portfolio volumes into the market under various commercial agreements in increase in the percentage of our total volume that is contracted. So far in 2021, we\u2019ve entered into fixed fee sales agreements for portfolio volumes with multiple counterparties aggregating approximately 12 million tons of LNG volume between this year and 2032 in addition to the IPM deal with Tourmaline. The success of this mid-term strategy underscores the strength in the LNG market today and this strategic competitive advantage of our portfolio volumes. We\u2019ll continue to place these flexible volumes in the market tailoring solutions to meet the growing requirements of LNG customers worldwide. On the production side, the record we set in the first quarter for LNG exports didn\u2019t stand very long as we broke that record in the second quarter with 139 cargoes of LNG exported from our two facilities. Year-to-date, Asia destination of Cheniere cargoes with approximately 45% of our cargoes exported having landed in Asia, followed by Europe with roughly 35% and Latin America with about 20%. South Korea and China are the top two countries importing our LNG so far this year. And those two alone accounts for over a quarter of all cargo deliveries. Our operations and maintenance teams at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi have done an exceptional job thus far in 2021, managing our operating plans to maximize asset availability and LNG production at our facilities, enabling us to increase our production forecast for the year all while ramping Corpus Christi Train 3 to full rates and stable operations quickly and safely. We look forward to the same performance with the addition of Sabine Pass Train 6 early next year. Thinking of Train 6, a significant milestone was met last month with the introduction of fuel gas into the train signaling the start of early commissioning activities. At the site 17 systems were turned over to the startup team in June another 12 in July with a project approximately 90% complete Bechtel continues to progress this project against an accelerated schedule. Turn now to Slide 6, I\u2019ll provide a brief review of Stage 3 in the Corpus Christi site overall as the Stage 3 project comes into focus with our recent commercial momentum and the constructive market we\u2019re in. As a reminder, our Stage 3 project at Corpus Christi is fully permitted and a fully constructed would have over 10 million tons of LNG capacity per year. Stage 3 enjoys brownfield project economics, as it will utilize a significant amount of shared infrastructure constructed as part of trains one through three, which we believe makes Stage 3 very cost competitive LNG capacity addition. As for the path to FID, we have said this before we will maintain our discipline to help ensure that the risk and return profile of Stage 3 is consistent with that or the first nine trains we\u2019ve built. To that end, our origination team is focused on commercializing additional capacity from the project and we\u2019re working closely with Bechtel on front lines and the EPC contract. We remain committed to our growth capital investment parameters, which help ensure discipline in our capital investment decisions and the sanctioning of projects only when they meet the high standard we have set for all FIDs to date. Our excitement around the potential investment opportunities at the Corpus Christi site doesn\u2019t end with Stage 3. As you may recall, we have acquired approximately 500 acres adjacent to our existing site, which provides just with a platform for major future development potential. Any future capacity developed at this site, maybe designed to leverage the infrastructure already in place to provide substantial cost advantages. As you can see from the arrow of view as a land position at Corpus Christi, the site possesses substantial running room for growth well beyond Stage 3, and we may develop additional infrastructure there over time, especially at Stage 3 moves closer to FID. Turn now to Slide 7, last month, we were proud to publish our second annual corporate responsibility report entitled built for the challenge. This report the product of a deep cross functional effort across the entire company provides insight into key actions taken by Cheniere to ensure business resiliency in 2020 and beyond, and is the latest example of our transparency on ESG related issues and how we\u2019re building sustainability into our business model. Built for the challenge is a latest milestone in our ESG journey, which has seen tremendous progress in 2021. Highlights of achievements reach thus far through 2021 included the announcement of our cargo and mission tags, the climate scenario analysis we published our first carbon neutral LNG cargo we announced last quarter, our participation in the first ever study to measure methane emissions on an LNG carrier in our collaboration with leading academic institutions and several of our upstream natural gas suppliers to implement QMRV of greenhouse gas emissions performance and natural gas production sites across several bases. And finally, earlier today we announced the publication of our peer reviewed greenhouse gas lifecycle assessment or LCA, which utilizes greenhouse gas emissions data specific to our LNG supply and will be the foundational analytical tool to estimate greenhouse gas emissions to be included in our CE tags that we provide our customers. The items highlighted on the slide are all steps on a continuous path. And we look forward to leading our industry forward in this area helping to ensure the long-term sustainability of natural gas and helping all participants among the LNG value chain realize the full environmental benefits of our LNG. With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Anatol who will provide some more details on recent LNG market development.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9. Globally, the pace of recovery in LNG markets from the COVID-related lows has exceeded most expectations, especially when looking at demand growth in the fourth quarter of 2020 through the first quarter of 2021. This trend continued in the second quarter with not only meaningful growth over the same period in 2020, but also notably well above the five-year range, supporting our constructive market views on 2021 and subsequent years. We continue to see a fundamentally tight market over the next several years, breaking the trend for seasonal demand norms, even with rebounding LNG supply. As reflected by the historically high LNG prices in both Europe and Asia markets remain tight through this past winter with global LNG demand growing by 9% year-over-year in the second quarter, slightly surpassing the fourth quarter demand levels, despite the second quarter, historically being a shoulder period in the market. Asia and Europe exited spring with sizable storage deficits as the cold winter in Asia and the colder than normal spring in Europe intensified the inter basin competition for LNG supply. Asia and Europe\u2019s robust demand plus spreads between the two regions to narrow, but European net backs even surpassing those in Asia in order to attract the imports amid insufficient LNG supply availability in Q2. Global LNG production rebounded 8% year-over-year in Q2, primarily on U.S. volume growing 80% compared to last year when customers were exercising their cargo cancellation rights. Through the first half of the year, U.S. LNG production is up 43% year-over-year, approximately 35 million tons. However, non-U.S. volumes have lag more than expected during most of 2021 so far and remain below 2020 levels in June. These non-U.S. volumes were impacted by feed gas constraints in Trinidad and maintenance and outages in North Africa and other LNG producing regions. Consequently less LNG flow to Europe year-over-year, as it competed for cargoes with Asia and Latin America. Overall U.S. LNG flows to Asia increased over 10% in the first half of 2021 to 48% of total U.S. exports compared to 38% in the first half of 2020. Meanwhile flows to Europe dropped over 15 percentage points from 51% to 34% year-over-year coinciding with natural gas storage inventories again at multiyear lows. Please turn to Slide 10, where I\u2019ll provide additional insight into the regional dynamics of the market. In Europe, weather driven demand supported the gas market well into the injection season. High carbon prices and low wind generation in June further lifted European gas demand for power generation. However, upstream maintenance across Northwest Europe, flat Russian gas pipeline flows and lower LNG imports kept the market tight and storage inventories at a significant deficit relative to historic norms. LNG flows into Europe were 9% or roughly 2.1 million tons lower year-on-year in Q2, as a result of tight global LNG supply balances. European inventories currently stand at record low levels with a 16 BCM deficit to the five-year average, which is equivalent to roughly 170 LNG cargoes. These supply and demand dynamics were reflected in European gas prices during the second quarter with Dutch TTF settlement averages increasing by over $6/MMBtu to $7.82/MMBtu and almost 350% increase year-over-year. This average was higher than JKM as the basins competed for import volumes. Similarly, in Asia, the continued call on LNG imports to satisfy growing natural gas demand was driven by an early start to the summer, a surge in economic recovery and industrial activity in China, along with heavy nuclear maintenance in Korea. Jack mentioned a moment ago that Korea and China alone imported over 25% of all our LNG production year-to-date. Asia imported 65 million tons of LNG in the second quarter, an increase of 8 million tons or 14% year-on-year. The JKT region contributed over 20% of that growth, despite higher nuclear availability in Japan. 10 nuclear units have restarted in Japan as of July 21, the highest number of operating units since the Fukushima disaster over a decade ago. Japan\u2019s nuclear availability was offset by low nuclear output in Korea and Taiwan. A particular note, Taiwan retire at 25% of its nuclear fleet in the second quarter and has a stated goal to become nuclear free by 2025. So this should continue to support the LNG market in the region for years to come. The majority of growth in Asian LNG demand, however, came from Mainland China. Imports in China surge 22% to 20 million tons in the second quarter, making China the largest LNG importer on a global basis surpassing Japan. LNG imports were supported by harder than normal weather in South China, rising industrial gas demand and increased power sector demand amid low hydro levels. In addition to Asia and Europe, we saw a notable uptick in Latin American demand as Brazil\u2019s imports reached multiyear highs due to severe drought conditions and the resulting lack of hydropower. Latin America\u2019s imports increased more than 70% year-on-year in the second quarter, with Cheniere produced cargoes baking up nearly 40% of total imports. Flows into Latin America represented 17% of total U.S. exports, increasing over 5% from the comparable 2020 period. Clearly, both near-term and long-term dynamics in the LNG market provide a highly constructive backdrop for us to execute on our short, medium and long-term LNG origination strategies. With highly flexible portfolio volumes available today and cost competitive brownfield incremental capacity that we\u2019re actively commercializing, we possess an ideal platform to meet the growing and evolving needs of LNG customers worldwide. Now, turn to Slide 11. As natural gas solidifies its place as a foundational fuel in the global transition to lower carbon energy sources, LNG consumers and producers are seeking to optimize the environmental performance of LNG throughout the value chain. Jack reviewed some of the recent steps, which Cheniere have taken and will continue to take as part of a broader strategy focused on data and transparency through the LNG lifecycle. With the ultimate goal of emissions abatement in order to maximize the climate benefits of our LNG for all. The growing focus on environmental stewardship and performance is beginning to be reflected in pricing mechanics for energy. In the European Union, carbon prices reached all time highs in the second quarter, reaching over \u20ac55 per ton during the quarter and continuing higher to nearly \u20ac60 per ton or roughly $3.50/MMBtu equivalent in early July. Industry commentators view the growth and increased liquidity in the emissions trading market to be an enduring trend, as demand for allowances and offsets grow across the globe driven by decarbonisation efforts. While Europe is by far the most active markets for exchange traded of carbon allowances. We\u2019re seeing increased activity in other parts of the world as well, especially Asia. China recently launched its own national emissions trading market, making it the largest carbon market in the world at its onset. We believe other markets will follow this trend, as progress on climate action will continue to buoy demand for cleaner burning fuels. This is relevant to Cheniere and the LNG market, because the appetite for carbon neutral LNG is increasing and carbon offsets are a necessary tool in certifying cargoes as carbon neutral. While this market is nascent today, as of mid-July, there were 12 carbon neutral LNG cargoes in 2021 globally. There are significant interest in these offerings among both buyers and sellers, given our size, scale and progress to-date, leading on data-driven environmental transparency and performance and some of the other efforts, Jack highlighted. Cheniere expects to play a prominent role in this regard from our life cycle analysis and the cargo emission tags and our QMRV collaboration, we aim to offer increased environmental transparency while providing low emission solutions and competitively structured products for our buyers. Thank you all for your time. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Zach, who will review our financial results and guidance.\nZach Davis: Thanks, Anatol, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to be here today to review our second quarter financial results and our increased full year 2021 guidance. Turning to Slide 13. For the second quarter, we generated revenue of approximately $3 billion, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $340 million, and a net loss of $329 million. As Jack mentioned, our results for the quarter were negatively impacted by the accounting treatment for our derivative instruments, which includes our IPM agreements. As we have discussed in prior quarters, our IPM agreements, certain gas supply agreements, and certain forward sales of LNG qualify as derivatives and require mark-to-market accounting, meaning that from period to period, we will experience gains and losses as movements occur in the underlying forward commodity curves. This accounting treatment coupled with significant volumes, long-term duration and volatility in price basis for certain contracts. Most notably, our IPM agreements will result in fluctuations in fair market value from period-of-period. While operationally, we seek to eliminate commodity risk by matching our natural gas purchases and LNG sales on the same pricing index. Our long-term LNG SPAs do not currently qualify from mark-to-market accounting, meaning that the fair market value impact of only one side of the transaction is often recognized on our financial statements until the sale of LNG occurs. The unfavorable pretax impact from changes in the fair value of our commodity and FX derivatives during second quarter of 2021 was approximately $672 million. Most of which was non-cash, but was the primary driver of our recognized net loss for the second quarter. For the second quarter, we recognized in income 522 TBtu of physical LNG, including 508 TBtu from our projects and 14 TBtu from third-parties. Approximately 80% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SPAs or from volumes procured under our IPM agreements. We received no cargo cancellations and had no impact to revenue recognition timing related to cargo cancellations in the second quarter. We received $36 million related to sales of commissioning cargoes in the second quarter from LNG, which was in transit at the end of the first quarter, corresponding to 6 TBtu of LNG. As a reminder, amounts received from the sale of commissioning cargoes are offset against LNG terminal construction and process. Net of the cost associated with production and delivery of those cargoes. As you may recall, we established an initial debt reduction for 2021 to pay down at least $500 million of outstanding debt. During the second quarter, we fully repaid the remaining outstanding borrowings under Cheniere\u2019s term loan and fully repaid Cheniere\u2019s convertible notes due May 2021. With $500 million of cash on hand and the remainder about $130 million from borrowings under the CEI revolver. So as of June 30, we have already achieved our minimum full year goal of $500 million in debt reduction. With our cash flow profile only improving in the back half of the year, we were poised to exceed that amount this year, along with broadening out our capital allocation plans. Continue with the balance sheet management, since our last call, we have locked in a further $200 million of long-term amortizing fixed rate notes at SPL on a private placement basis with multiple counterparties. Year-to-date, we have locked in approximately $347 million of Dutch, which will fund on a delayed draw basis in late 2021, and will economically refinance a portion of SPL outstanding 6.25% notes due 2022. This continue progress on prudently managing the balance sheets through the near structure, which goes hand-in-hand with our efforts on execution and operational performance was once again recognized by the credit rating agencies during the second quarter. As S&P global ratings change the outlook on the credit ratings of both Cheniere and CQP to positive from negative, as we mentioned on the May call. S&P side of the EBITDA and cash flow growth resulting from the successful completion of eight trains, the accelerated schedule of train sticks and the expectation of significant improvement in leverage levels over the next two years, as we execute on our stated deleveraging plans. Jack and Anatol have both discussed the success we\u2019ve had so far in 2021 on marketing and origination with 12 million tons of midterm deals done as well as the recent 15 year term, terminally IPM transaction. The execution of these transactions not only brings stage three integrator focus, but also supports our long-term balance sheet management priorities by bringing significantly increased cash flow visibility out into the 2030s, given the fixed fees that have always been the bedrock of our commercial strategy. Aggregating the mid-term and IPM transactions we\u2019ve completed year-to-date, we have sold approximately 25 million tons of LNG, which will generate over $3 billion in fixed fees into the next decade, which clearly has de-risked our cash flows further. Turn now to Slide 14. As previously mentioned, today, we are increasing our guidance ranges for full year 2021 consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributed cash flow by $300 million and $200 million respectively. Bringing total increases to $700 million and $600 million respectively. Above the original ranges we provided in November of last year, our revised guidance ranges are $4.6 to $4.9 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion in distributable cash flow. Today\u2019s increase in guidance is largely driven by the continued improvement in global LNG market pricing and our ability to capture higher net backs on our open portfolio volume. Our production forecast, we have again revised upward due primarily to maintenance optimization. And lastly, some added lifting margin due to higher Henry Hub prices. DCF guidance isn\u2019t moving up quite as much as EBITDA guidance, due to some incremental EBITDA accruing at CQP and SPL, where we have accelerated capital spend at Sabine since Train 6 is ahead of schedule. So we expect to realize the benefits over time in DCF as CQP is distributions increased further in the coming years, once fully operational. When we updated guidance on the last call, one of the primary drivers was an improvement in market margins from approximately $2 in February to approximately $3 in May. Since then, that margin has gone up by another over $3 and our production forecast as increased as well. Incremental volume that\u2019s been added to the production forecast is all in the third and fourth quarters. And although, it\u2019s single digit number of cargoes in terms of quantity, the impact on the financial forecast is meaningful with net packs where they are. We currently forecast the dollar change in market margin would impact EBITDA by less than $25 million for the rest of the full year 2021. As we have now sold almost all of our production for the remainder of the year, we would only provide another update if that were to change materially. As well, given a little remaining exposure to the market we have, we are confident in our ability to deliver results within these upwardly revised guidance ranges for the full year. While we don\u2019t guide to free cash flow for over a year now, we\u2019ve described 2021 Cheniere\u2019s cash flow inflection point, another certainly materializing and the results we\u2019ve generated so far this year and in our forecast for the balance of the year. Entering 2021, we forecasted free cash flow at around $1 billion for the year. As DCF guidance has moved up $600 million in the subsequent six months, it\u2019s reasonable to think our FCF forecast has moved up largely in lockstep with DCF, so over $1.5 billion. This incremental cash flow puts us in a great position from a capital allocation perspective, especially, as we work to finalize our comprehensive capital allocation strategy and framework. With that process nearing completion, we expect to be able to provide that to you in the coming months and before the 3Q earnings call in early November, where we will provide you with a first look at 2022 guidance. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lapides: Hey guys. Thank you for taking my question. Congrats on a really good first half of the year so far. Just one maybe for Anatol, just two things. One, how are you thinking about the changes in contract structures that you\u2019re seeing in the market, meaning we\u2019ve seen some other North American LNG players announced deals that are priced at basically a sliding scale tied to JKM. Just curious when you\u2019re thinking about what the market is going to do for new contracts, is your thought that it\u2019s still an SPA driven kind of fixed fee driven type of market. Or do you think it\u2019s going to go to more of a variable type fee structure for future deals?\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Michael. Good morning. Yes. In short, the market is growing maturing and we expect to see all of the above in greater quantities. We\u2019re in the camp that the traditional SPAs long-term are part and parcel of this business and is required for us, for example, to commit capital. And we think that our commercial creativity is one of our main calling cards, right? We introduced the IPM business now over two years ago, and that\u2019s a business where the producer gets exposure to those international indices, we collect our fixed fee and the producer passes allows for that commodity exposure to their underlying resource. So we think all of this stuff is part and parcel of the business going forward. You\u2019ll see traditional SPAs and you\u2019ll see as we mentioned, a lot more midterm business from us that we\u2019ve been so successful with since we launched it less than a year ago.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. And then one quick follow up on Stage 3, just curious, how much more do you think you need to contract before you think you\u2019re getting close to FID?\nJack Fusco: Hey, Michael, I just wanted to add a little bit to Anatol answer to your question, and then we\u2019ll talk about Stage 3. So I would say, we\u2019re in the catbird seat, we have a great position. We\u2019re able to offer solutions for customers. We\u2019ve been very successful on offering short-term, mid-term contracts to those customers that want those that don\u2019t use to grow the business. We\u2019re not in the FID business, we\u2019re in the making money business. So we\u2019re staying extremely financially disciplined on our next expansion project, just like we have on the first nine. But I\u2019ll turn it over to Zach to talk in more specifics on Stage 3.\nZach Davis: Sure. Hey, Michael. So I\u2019ll just start off the saying last November, Jack mentioned that we were around 85% contracted and at this point we\u2019re 90% with all the work that the marketing team has done. And when you think about 90% on a 45 million ton book, that\u2019s a little over 40 million ton, our contracted at this point. So we\u2019re actually pretty darn close to considering a FID of Stage 3 and why we\u2019re so confident about doing that next year. But as noted, as Jack mentioned, it\u2019s all about our discipline approach to just major capital investments, meaning it\u2019s not just about the volume, but about the returns on both the levered and unlevered basis from a highly contracted cash flow. So that when we thanks in a project, it\u2019s value and credit accretive and the very, very best use of our cash. But with that all in mind, it is around, let\u2019s say, four or so mtpa of additional contracting to underpin all of Stage 3, ensure our run rate contracted capacity remains in that 80% to 90% range, even at FID. And of course all the investment parameters are met. So again, we\u2019re pretty confident that a 2022 could be a big year for us.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you guys. Much appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from [indiscernible] from UBS. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning, everyone. This is Brian on for Shneur. Appreciate all the color on the $300 million guidance range. Just curious if you could provide a little bit more color on the changes between 1Q and 2Q guidance. In your prepared remarks, you talked about the maintenance optimization and it was just kind of curious how much capacity Cheniere was actually able to free up at these attractive spot margins. I know you talk about a dollar change in marketing margin equals 25 and even an impact book was just kind of curious if you could provide a little bit more color behind, all of the drivers in the guidance range of $300 million. Thanks.\nJack Fusco: Well, thanks, Brian. And I have to say I\u2019m so pleased with our operations and maintenance personnel and our ability to optimize our maintenance schedules and take advantage of what seems to be a very high price LNG market right now. But as far as the details of how it breaks down, I\u2019ll turn that over to Zach.\nZach Davis: Hey, Brian. So the $300 million upward move in guidance is pretty simple. It\u2019s three things. it\u2019s higher net backs, a bit more production and better lifting margin, but to be clear higher margins on the open capacity and some additional production where the vast majority of the guidance rage. So with the dramatic rise in CMI netbacks since early May from literally just under three bucks to over $6 today for the rest of the year. And with that 40 CBQ previously open that added almost 150 million of that raise. Then combine that with another, let\u2019s say, four or so cargoes from opportunistically managing maintenance for the rest of the year to take advantage of these current market conditions. And that added alone another $100 million. And the rest with just higher Henry Hub prices for the rest of the year, as we expect to literally lift every last drop of LNG, lifting margin made up most of the rest. And that simply gets you $300 million or so.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great appreciate all that color. Maybe to pivot capital allocation and just to follow up on CCL Stage 3, seems to suggest that you\u2019re close to FID at this point, if you can get the necessary contracts, just in the overall scheme of things, with the desire to become IgE and with the recent positive outlooks of the credit agencies. How does growth and leverage reduction and effectively impact your desire around buybacks and a definite dividend initiation at this point? Thanks.\nZach Davis: Sure. I mean, put it this way. We\u2019re going to have $3 billion of BCF per year, and now with how the markets have improved and the curves have improved around $13 billion of available cash through 2025. And the equity check for something like Stage 3, which let\u2019s say it\u2019s around the mid-$3 billion range for the whole thing, is only about 800 million per year, once funded 50-50 with debt and equity, pro rata over time. So as you can see in the results, we\u2019re pretty much at a point in our life cycle, where we can undertake the project with the scale of Stage 3 and not be limited whatsoever from also meeting all of our balance sheet and shareholder capital return goals over the coming years. So nothing\u2019s really holding us back at this point.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Appreciate the color and congrats on the quarter. Have a good day.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nJack Fusco: Good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to pick up with the market outlook a little bit more. Second quarter last year, spot LNG, couple of bucks now LNG prices comfortably trading above a high teens for winter and seasonally high spot rates right now. And I\u2019m just kind of wondering based on carbon prices and structural demand shift. How do you think about, I guess, the pricing dynamic today, has it changed or where do you see us in the cycle? And I guess, how that could impact, I guess, appetite for contract contracting?\nJack Fusco: Well, I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll hand it over to Anatol. The increased volatility and the higher prices just bring more and more customers to want to lock in their energy costs naturally and reduce the volatility to their customer base. So as you know, Jeremy, we focused on selling to end users, we sell most of our product to utilities around the world and they need it. And as more and more of these countries, try to meet their climate goals and clean up their air, especially in and around Asia, you\u2019re seeing the demand for that gas and the demand for LNG rise, fairly significantly and much greater than what was in any of our models initially, but I\u2019ll turn it over to Anatol.\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Thanks, Jack. Thanks, Jeremy. We\u2019ve been fairly bullish on the markets in the first half of this decade and saw 2021 as a transition year, as we\u2019ve touched on previous calls that transitioned faster than we expected, kind of across the board. Asia\u2019s rebound and demand growth and all of this investment that we saw on gas infrastructure and LNG infrastructure and demand is playing out arguably faster than we expected. And in the aggregate, U.S. came to the rescue second half of last year and the first half of this year with additional volumes, but now everything is online obviously. We and everyone else are trying as hard as possible to bring this volume to market. And the market is still tight, right. Demand exceeded supply in Q2, which is why you saw the storage dynamics and the pricing dynamics that you mentioned. And we are only entering this phase of the market, as Jack said, this is the first time that in its tenure at Cheniere that is in the both part of the cycle for the sellers and long-term and mid-term commitments are accelerating as a result, right. It\u2019s not a surprise to anyone that this is playing out, but it is playing out a little bit faster. And Zach mentioned our comfort level with 2022 is that much higher. The other important component that you touched on, on the carbon side, and this is why the journey to get this LCA product out that that we announced this morning was so important. We are highly confident that we have a very low profile, low emissions profile product that will be a major contributor to emissions reductions in Europe, Asia, and everywhere that, that we structurally deliver our product into. So there\u2019s a mention of a case study in there that shows that our product reduces emissions by about 50% when displacing coal in China. And that is a great starting point on this journey that that we\u2019ve announced this morning. So very optimistic about the structure of the market and our ability to offer these solutions both economically and environmentally.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. So it seems like price of carbon could lift the LNG market maybe there. And maybe just kind of building on that last point a bit more, you announced this collaboration with natural gas suppliers and academic institutions to improve emissions monitoring. Just wondering what you\u2019re learning here. I think you\u2019ve touched on some of the points here, but just wondering, it seems like the market is going in this direction. Do you see any other kind of low-hanging fruit for Cheniere here? Some that are looking to compete with you have introduced CCUS strategies. Do you think that\u2019s where the market\u2019s going overall?\nJack Fusco: Look, I think the pathway to the energy transition is a very, very long road and it\u2019s going to need some of everything, a lot of everything, that, that, that we can develop today and 20 years from now. We embarked upon the journey back in 2018. We\u2019ve spent well over the last three years working on a company specific lifecycle analysis in LCA that we published recently with American society of chemical engineers, but it\u2019s not \u2013 we\u2019re \u2013 our program has been very thoughtful and very forward thinking, and we\u2019re hoping to lead the industry into ensuring that our product is viewed as a sustainable provider of cleaner energy for the world. So that\u2019s what it\u2019s all leading to the life cycle analysis is extremely important for us to be able to produce our cargo emission tags or our carbon footprint per cargo for our customers. So we can help them strategize on whether or not what type of offsets, they would like to procure and the quantity those offsets. So \u2013 but \u2013 Anatol you have anything to add on?\nAnatol Feygin: No, we\u2019re \u2013 Jeremy, as you mentioned, we\u2019re taking this leading role in developing these technologies and collaborating and creating the baseline from which improvements will be made over time. We\u2019re starting off at a great point. That\u2019s much better than what had been assumed and what is the national average that\u2019s \u2013 that is out there and with all of these efforts with our producer partners and our downstream partners, and of course at our own facility. As Jack said, we will continue to be laser focused on continuing to improve our emissions profile. We think that that\u2019s a key success factors as we compete in the energy transition.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Please go ahead.\nMatt Taylor: Yes. Thanks for taking my question here. I wanted to keep going on that LCA theme there. My question wants \u2013 focus on the cost. What are you guys seeing on a cost from in BTU basis for offering these cargo emissions tags. And then sort of the follow on comment to that, do you see this being more of a niche type product where customers are willing to pay a premium for those cargoes and offset those additional costs? Or do you just see this being the trend of where the market\u2019s going?\nJack Fusco: On the \u2013 the first one on the cost, so we\u2019re doing a lot of the work in-house, Matt. So we \u2013 the costs are born with our overall SG&A budgets, and there\u2019s a slight amount of a little bit of capital dollars, but it\u2019s insignificant. It\u2019s more of the just the in-house expertise on each of the different areas and our ability to help influence the market. And I\u2019m actually looking at Corey Grindal so on the supplier side to make sure that, that we\u2019re getting good data, that, that we can quantify, monitor, validate, and report on that data and feel good that there\u2019s an auditable trail that, that we can stand behind both from our supplier side, from the midstream and processing folks through our own liquefaction treatment and then in shipping to our customers docs. I do think the carbon emission tags are necessary for first, most of our European counterparts. They\u2019ve applauded us for doing it. They\u2019ve been buying offsets themselves. And in most cases they\u2019re overbuying those offsets. So we \u2013 it just a part of doing business that we need to be able to quantify what the carbon footprint is of those of each and every one of those tankers for our customer base. Whether or not eventually we get paid a premium for having a clean cargo, we\u2019ll see how that market develops. Right now, there\u2019s just a lot of work, a lot of spade work that has to get done before we feel comfortable with actually marketing and selling a product like that.\nMatt Taylor: Thanks for those comments, Jack. And then to finish off here, I know you don\u2019t have formal guidance for 2022 yet, but that\u2019s just how attractive margins, like you\u2019re saying, Zack has become in the Train 6 starting commissioning activity here in July. Did you guys be able to provide some preliminary commentary on how you see earnings trending in 2022 versus your run rate guidance?\nZach Davis: Sure. I\u2019ll give you a little bit, but we plan to present that to you really in on the next call in November, after we go through the 2022 budget process, but it\u2019s really going to come down to where margins are going to be for the winter, and then just timing with how Train 6 commissioning comes along in the first half of the year, but at the rate can SPL construction is going and with margins for 2022, right now, above $6 for the winter and over $3 for the rest of the next year. It\u2019s looking likely that EBITDA should be over $5 billion for 2022 if things don\u2019t move too much from here. So we\u2019re obviously getting closer and closer to run rate.\nMatt Taylor: Thanks, Zach. That\u2019s it for me.\nOperator: Next question comes from Mike Webber from Webber Research. Please go ahead.\nMike Webber: Hey, good morning, guys. How are you?\nJack Fusco: Michael, how are you?\nMike Webber: Good. Jack, I liked your quote earlier now that you\u2019re in the business of making money, not in the FID business, which is relatively appropriate. So along those lines, and then maybe there\u2019s a better question for Anatol. I\u2019m curious how term pricing taking the net back deals kind of a side and because there is actually some term pricing deals that are getting done. If we sent any kind of lifts in terms of term pricing dynamics right now, just given the ramp out of COVID and the kind of homogeneous degree of supply slippage we\u2019ve been seeing, are you getting any support in terms of where that, that long-term SPA level actually sits?\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. I would say thanks, Michael. We have a lot more appetite engagement traction I mean is only six, nine months ago where \u2013 when there was a \u2013 I would say a cadre of the industry that was thinking about remaining open for it\u2019s a sort of fundamental requirements and relying on the spot market that started to fade a quarter after that. And I think that that strategy is \u2013 has not been largely forgotten. So now it\u2019s about portfolio management, engaging and structuring a portfolio of mid-term and long-term volumes. And as a result of those conversations, the economics are stabilizing and firming. And you\u2019ve seen that relatively openly in the slopes that you see on the Brent side, that that\u2019s an easier one to track, where we\u2019ve come off those very low levels. And obviously the economics are stabilizing now for term commitments out of the NYMEX market as well.\nMike Webber: Got you. If I were to think about that \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, go ahead.\nJack Fusco: It depends on when it\u2019s going to begin also. So if you think about a term \u2013 if it\u2019s steep deed on a greenfield project is going to begin five years from now. It\u2019s probably priced at the marginal cost of the next investment or the next train, right. And if it\u2019s like more like a Cheniere portfolio contract that can begin now or next year or any time for that matter. And then you should expect it to be priced at the \u2013 at a higher level, right for more certainty.\nMike Webber: Got you. And I guess my follow-up is how uniform you think that is over the broader market. So if I think about maybe the way you guys have price term business, as kind of IG pricing versus the more aggressive pricing we\u2019ve seen out of some greenfields be it net back or not. Do you think that spread between IG term pricing and greenfield is wider today than it was maybe this time last year or six months ago more than relatively consistent with.\nAnatol Feygin: I think the dramatic changes in that market, in that spread played out probably two or three years ago. I honestly don\u2019t have enough precision to tell you if that\u2019s moved around a bit, but as Jack said there was a premium that the market will pay for certainty and our track record in history. As well as for early volumes that are included in that, that obviously greenfield can provide. So I just don\u2019t have enough precision to give you a good answer on that.\nMike Webber: Fair enough. And then my follow-up for Zach, actually just along the lines of some of the more variable rate deals that we\u2019ve seen in the market, do they directs net back deals or not? When you\u2019re talking to your lenders about those kinds of deals, what kind of guidance do you get in terms of the makeup of a portfolio of a really financeable portfolio? And how should we think about what \u2013 how should we think about the concentration of those kinds of deals within a portfolio of business that is actually financeable?\nZach Davis: I think I just go back to what Jack said, first and foremost, we\u2019re here to create maximum value for LNG shareholders period. So it\u2019s not just about the next FID or signing a contract for the sake of FID to win some race for the lowest price FID or the highest risk FID, I\u2019m sorry, high risk SPA. So luckily with the funnel that Anatol and the team has, we think we\u2019re just going to be clipping fix fees for a vast majority of our volume that will meet all of our investment parameters. And it\u2019s going to be a mix of IPM, DS and FOB deals with each and every one with a credit worthy counter-party and fixed fees for a long, long time. We can\u2019t really speak to other business models. That\u2019s our business model and we\u2019re sticking to it.\nMike Webber: Yes. And I was curious whether you were getting any feedback from your lenders around that, but I can take that offline. All right. Thanks, guys. It\u2019s done.\nJack Fusco: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Next question comes from Ben Nolan from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBen Nolan: Yes, thanks. So I wanted to \u2013 we\u2019ll start with probably an easy one. You talked about the 12 million tons of mid-term volume that you have committed over the next 11 years or so. Maybe we get a sense of sort of what the average contract duration is for that portion?\nJack Fusco: It\u2019s not that easy volume weighted. I would say it\u2019s just inside of five years would be my guess.\nBen Nolan: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Sorry, go ahead.\nZach Davis: I was just going to add, when we\u2019re talking about those mid-term deals, we didn\u2019t mention that all the deals we signed at is about $3 billion of fixed fees through the early 2030s. But just thinking about how much de-risking of our cash flows has just occurred over the past quarter. We now have locked in this year, fixed fees for about $400 million just in 2022 and comfortably over $1.5 billion through 2025. Just to give you perspective of how much has really been locked in the past quarter or so.\nBen Nolan: That\u2019s great color. I appreciate that Zach. And maybe, well, boy, I wish I had more than one. We\u2019ll stick with this one. So as you\u2019re looking at Stage 3 at Corpus Christi, obviously we have higher steel prices, labor inflation is happening all over the place. As it relates to Corpus Christi 3, and maybe just in general expansion of for you and anybody else, are you starting to see any inflation and the cost of projects that might necessitate pushing up margins a little bit in order to generate good returns?\nJack Fusco: Thanks, Ben. And I have to say, we have a very strong relationship with Bechtel having completed nine trains and 45 million tons of liquefaction already. I have complete confidence in Bechtel that they can manage the project to its lowest capital costs out there. We haven\u2019t seen any inflationary environments at this point, but I\u2019ll turn it over to Zach and let him.\nZach Davis: Yes. Just to reiterate, we don\u2019t really see material risks on the cost side and we\u2019re actively pursuing all opportunities through the \u2013 really the end of this year to make it as price competitive as possible. But I\u2019ll just say we feel really good to meet all of those investment parameters based on the contracts we\u2019re seeing and just the synergies we have with Corpus Trains 1, 2, 3. And that let\u2019s say approximately six times multiple on CapEx to EBITDA is still the right one give or take for the full project.\nBen Nolan: Perfect. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey guys, I know we\u2019re getting to the top of the hour, so I\u2019ll make it quick. If I can just come back to the carbon question, especially as you think about some of the advantage credits here, can you talk a little bit more about the specific structuring and how you would take advantage of the 45 to otherwise from a carbon neutrality perspective to the extent possible? And then separately, just how is relatively that position, your expansion opportunities here vis-\u00e0-vis alternatives. Again, I gathered that the geography might be more amenable than others, but that that\u2019s open-ended here. I\u2019d love to hear on that. And then do you have any sensitivity, you can speak to a little bit on the hedge position on the \u2013 to clarify last question there. But I\u2019ll leave it there.\nJack Fusco: Okay. So Julien, let me \u2013 I think I heard your first part of your question was on carbon and carbon sequestration and just carbon and 45\u2026\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes.\nJack Fusco: I had spent weeks ago, I spent a week \u2013 and I will tell anybody that, that $45 to $50 a ton is not going to cut the mustard for especially for post combustion carbon sequestration. It\u2019s not going to work and there\u2019s nothing technically yet that is that economical to make that happen. We do sit on top of a very deep, a very large sailing offer that would be looks to be geologically a good spot to sequester carbon dioxide, doing it though is a whole another challenge. So we\u2019re spending a lot of time and resources on categorizing, everything that can possibly putting a price tag to try and trying to see if four, five that works and so far it doesn\u2019t. So I \u2013 and I am remiss to say that I don\u2019t know why if I\u2019m able to sequester a ton of carbon, that it\u2019s all, I only get $50 of ton, but if someone else uses direct air capture, they get 175 a ton. Or if I drive an EV are in Cheniere electric vehicle, I guess 450 a ton. None of that makes sense to me, if a price of a carbon molecules should be consistent and it should reward those of us that can do something to put the world in a better position, so.\nAnatol Feygin: Then you mentioned something about open capacity 2022 and hedging. And yes, besides those mid-term fields that already locked in around $400 million to fix margin next year, you can expect that the at this point in the year, we\u2019ll already hedging some of our capacity for 2022 in anticipation of giving you guys full your guidance in November, with $6 in there and $3 for the rest of the year. Yes. We\u2019re using some of our capital to the hedge out forward.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: All right, great. I\u2019ll leave it there. It\u2019s noon. Thank you all very much. Have a good day.\nJack Fusco: Thank you, Julien.\nOperator: The next question comes from James Carreker from US Capital Advisors. Please go ahead.\nJames Carreker: Hi guys, thanks for the question. I guess, first off, really quickly, is there a I guess useful guideline to think about margins? When I look at the winter LNG curve at $16 and Henry Hub at $4, I kind of think of a number of potential margin much higher than %6. Am I doing some calculations wrong, or just any quick high level calculation to think about how that gets to a $6 margin.\nJack Fusco: Well, shipping curves have come way up also, James. You have to add, you can either add or subtract the shipping costs to either your JKM $16. You subtract it, or you add it to the $4, but shipping is not insignificant when margins get this high and everything is going to Asia that trip is a lot longer.\nJames Carreker: So it\u2019s just plus or minus $6 shipping costs.\nAnatol Feygin: Not quite that high, but yes, and shipping also just like the curves themselves has a seasonality. So winter shipping is higher than shoulder shipping.\nJames Carreker: Yes. Okay. It just seems like it wouldn\u2019t have moved to that much versus I guess just kind of the standard $2 estimates, but maybe it has. The other question\u2026\nJack Fusco: Sorry. James, we\u2019re also talking about a curve through next year. We\u2019re not talking about like a news blurb on Bloomberg today, but like a trader printing a cargo. So just kind of thing\u2026\nJames Carreker: Right. But you talked about $6 margins in the winter and 43 for the balance of the year.\nJack Fusco: That\u2019s right.\nJames Carreker: Yes. I was referring just to the winter months. Then the other question was just now with the second quarter in a row where you found additional production, does that imply anything maybe about upside to the five mtpa run rate per train long-term?\nJack Fusco: Not at this point, that 49 to 51 mtpa per train is the right one. And honestly, a lot of the outperformance this year is thanks to a really smooth ramp up of Train 3. So yes, we\u2019re still on that 49 to 51 range.\nJames Carreker: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Sean Morgan from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nSean Morgan: Thanks, guys. So the \u2013 I appreciate the creative \u2013 creativity in terms of the commercial aspects with signing up IPMs to start to underpin some of the volumes to going to need for Stage 3. Is there a possibility to kind of back-to-back those IPM agreements with more traditional SPAs and sort of double up on fixed fees there?\nAnatol Feygin: Well, Sean, thanks. It\u2019s Anatol. Look, it\u2019s a large portfolio Zack mentioned it\u2019s over 40 million tons now, and there are a number of positions that, that are managed in the aggregate. So it is exposure that we have and we are managing on behalf of our producer partners. And clearly there are synergies in that business with the downstream exposure that we manage on a day-to-day basis. So the short answer is, its part and parcel of the opportunity set that we have.\nSean Morgan: Okay, great. And then just really quick follow-up then. So those IPMs, I mean, in theory, the banks tend to get, it would be totally fine with you guys filling out that remaining 4 mtpa that you mentioned to get the FID with potentially just supply side deals.\nZach Davis: Technically they would, but we think it\u2019s going to be a mix and keep in mind, we already have a few contracts that are sitting at CMI and not allocated to a project yet, that, that are DS. So not everything will be IPM for sure, but again, it all comes back to credit worthiness, and a fix fee, and the capability to either deliver us the gas, or pick up the LNG and pay us that fixed fee as a percent of their EBITDA and these counterparties like Tourmaline check all those boxes.\nSean Morgan: Okay. Thanks, Zach.\nOperator: Next question comes from Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.\nCraig Shere: Hi, thanks for fitting me in. Doing the math on the disclosed fix fees for the mid-term contracts combined with their third IPM agreement looks like you\u2019re contracting at over 2.30 in the second quarter, a little above first quarter levels. It might have been more 2.25-ish. Given the current market tightness, could that start approaching $2.5 for five to 10-year agreements?\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Craig. I have a spreadsheet in front of me that goes through that. And even with that spreadsheet in front of me, it\u2019s pretty hard to summarize. So look, as Jack mentioned in the prompt for the next number of years, it\u2019s market prices, right. And that, that obviously these sixes and threes that we\u2019ve mentioned on this call filter through into those mid-term economics. So it depends on the tenor, but you should expect us to capture that that market or better for the relatively prompt volumes and then our long-term contract economics for the balance. So can those sprint above 2.5, if it\u2019s a relatively short tenor deal, of course, right. That\u2019s where the market is today.\nCraig Shere: Got you. And I understand the conversation that, hey guys, to clear the market, it\u2019s going to take everything, some demand that used to be long-term fixed and bilateral, we\u2019ll go to the medium and spot. There\u2019ll be new long-term SPAs, they\u2019ll be variable rate contracts. But in terms of the amount of new contracting, I\u2019m not talking about 10 years that is filling in for expiring contracts, and it does support any new capacity. I\u2019m not talking about yourself, I\u2019m talking about maybe some of the Chinese stuff in the first quarter. It just seems like in terms of real SPAs or IPM that can support truly new construction and project finance, it\u2019s been pretty thin. Do you see that starting to open up more? Do you agree? Do you see it starting to open up more? Could you see this in the future being a significant minority of the market, maybe a quarter of the new contracts?\nJack Fusco: I think your view is skewed to U.S. counterparties in those contracts. I think if you look globally, Craig, and you looked at the oil index contracts that are being signed almost daily, you\u2019ll see the market in the contracting market has been very lively. But if you\u2019re talking about just Henry Hub link, U.S. style markets are contracts than it\u2019s been less, but still pretty strong.\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. I just to follow-up on Jack\u2019s comments, 2020 was obviously an anomalous year, but even then you saw a fair amount of long-term contracting. And obviously 2018, 2019 were big years for the NYMEX market. And as we\u2019ve discussed the margin environment and the window is clearly open for more of that engagement now. And I think we\u2019ve viewed that that piece of the market is going to be volumetrically roughly similar to what it has been historically, just as the market grows, it\u2019ll be a smaller percentage of the total.\nCraig Shere: Got you. Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Okay. So that appears, that is all we have time for questions for today. I turn the call back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.\nJack Fusco: I just want to thank everybody for your supportive of Cheniere. It\u2019s been an interesting time with the pandemic. Please be safe out there. Please get vaccinated. And we\u2019ll talk to you, I guess, in November. Thanks. Bye-bye.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Anatol Feygin",
            "content": "Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9. Globally, the pace of recovery in LNG markets from the COVID-related lows has exceeded most expectations, especially when looking at demand growth in the fourth quarter of 2020 through the first quarter of 2021. This trend continued in the second quarter with not only meaningful growth over the same period in 2020, but also notably well above the five-year range, supporting our constructive market views on 2021 and subsequent years. We continue to see a fundamentally tight market over the next several years, breaking the trend for seasonal demand norms, even with rebounding LNG supply. As reflected by the historically high LNG prices in both Europe and Asia markets remain tight through this past winter with global LNG demand growing by 9% year-over-year in the second quarter, slightly surpassing the fourth quarter demand levels, despite the second quarter, historically being a shoulder period in the market. Asia and Europe exited spring with sizable storage deficits as the cold winter in Asia and the colder than normal spring in Europe intensified the inter basin competition for LNG supply. Asia and Europe's robust demand plus spreads between the two regions to narrow, but European net backs even surpassing those in Asia in order to attract the imports amid insufficient LNG supply availability in Q2. Global LNG production rebounded 8% year-over-year in Q2, primarily on U.S. volume growing 80% compared to last year when customers were exercising their cargo cancellation rights. Through the first half of the year, U.S. LNG production is up 43% year-over-year, approximately 35 million tons. However, non-U.S. volumes have lag more than expected during most of 2021 so far and remain below 2020 levels in June. These non-U.S. volumes were impacted by feed gas constraints in Trinidad and maintenance and outages in North Africa and other LNG producing regions. Consequently less LNG flow to Europe year-over-year, as it competed for cargoes with Asia and Latin America. Overall U.S. LNG flows to Asia increased over 10% in the first half of 2021 to 48% of total U.S. exports compared to 38% in the first half of 2020. Meanwhile flows to Europe dropped over 15 percentage points from 51% to 34% year-over-year coinciding with natural gas storage inventories again at multiyear lows. Please turn to Slide 10, where I'll provide additional insight into the regional dynamics of the market. In Europe, weather driven demand supported the gas market well into the injection season. High carbon prices and low wind generation in June further lifted European gas demand for power generation. However, upstream maintenance across Northwest Europe, flat Russian gas pipeline flows and lower LNG imports kept the market tight and storage inventories at a significant deficit relative to historic norms. LNG flows into Europe were 9% or roughly 2.1 million tons lower year-on-year in Q2, as a result of tight global LNG supply balances. European inventories currently stand at record low levels with a 16 BCM deficit to the five-year average, which is equivalent to roughly 170 LNG cargoes. These supply and demand dynamics were reflected in European gas prices during the second quarter with Dutch TTF settlement averages increasing by over $6/MMBtu to $7.82/MMBtu and almost 350% increase year-over-year. This average was higher than JKM as the basins competed for import volumes. Similarly, in Asia, the continued call on LNG imports to satisfy growing natural gas demand was driven by an early start to the summer, a surge in economic recovery and industrial activity in China, along with heavy nuclear maintenance in Korea. Jack mentioned a moment ago that Korea and China alone imported over 25% of all our LNG production year-to-date. Asia imported 65 million tons of LNG in the second quarter, an increase of 8 million tons or 14% year-on-year. The JKT region contributed over 20% of that growth, despite higher nuclear availability in Japan. 10 nuclear units have restarted in Japan as of July 21, the highest number of operating units since the Fukushima disaster over a decade ago. Japan's nuclear availability was offset by low nuclear output in Korea and Taiwan. A particular note, Taiwan retire at 25% of its nuclear fleet in the second quarter and has a stated goal to become nuclear free by 2025. So this should continue to support the LNG market in the region for years to come. The majority of growth in Asian LNG demand, however, came from Mainland China. Imports in China surge 22% to 20 million tons in the second quarter, making China the largest LNG importer on a global basis surpassing Japan. LNG imports were supported by harder than normal weather in South China, rising industrial gas demand and increased power sector demand amid low hydro levels. In addition to Asia and Europe, we saw a notable uptick in Latin American demand as Brazil's imports reached multiyear highs due to severe drought conditions and the resulting lack of hydropower. Latin America's imports increased more than 70% year-on-year in the second quarter, with Cheniere produced cargoes baking up nearly 40% of total imports. Flows into Latin America represented 17% of total U.S. exports, increasing over 5% from the comparable 2020 period. Clearly, both near-term and long-term dynamics in the LNG market provide a highly constructive backdrop for us to execute on our short, medium and long-term LNG origination strategies. With highly flexible portfolio volumes available today and cost competitive brownfield incremental capacity that we're actively commercializing, we possess an ideal platform to meet the growing and evolving needs of LNG customers worldwide. Now, turn to Slide 11. As natural gas solidifies its place as a foundational fuel in the global transition to lower carbon energy sources, LNG consumers and producers are seeking to optimize the environmental performance of LNG throughout the value chain. Jack reviewed some of the recent steps, which Cheniere have taken and will continue to take as part of a broader strategy focused on data and transparency through the LNG lifecycle. With the ultimate goal of emissions abatement in order to maximize the climate benefits of our LNG for all. The growing focus on environmental stewardship and performance is beginning to be reflected in pricing mechanics for energy. In the European Union, carbon prices reached all time highs in the second quarter, reaching over \u20ac55 per ton during the quarter and continuing higher to nearly \u20ac60 per ton or roughly $3.50/MMBtu equivalent in early July. Industry commentators view the growth and increased liquidity in the emissions trading market to be an enduring trend, as demand for allowances and offsets grow across the globe driven by decarbonisation efforts. While Europe is by far the most active markets for exchange traded of carbon allowances. We're seeing increased activity in other parts of the world as well, especially Asia. China recently launched its own national emissions trading market, making it the largest carbon market in the world at its onset. We believe other markets will follow this trend, as progress on climate action will continue to buoy demand for cleaner burning fuels. This is relevant to Cheniere and the LNG market, because the appetite for carbon neutral LNG is increasing and carbon offsets are a necessary tool in certifying cargoes as carbon neutral. While this market is nascent today, as of mid-July, there were 12 carbon neutral LNG cargoes in 2021 globally. There are significant interest in these offerings among both buyers and sellers, given our size, scale and progress to-date, leading on data-driven environmental transparency and performance and some of the other efforts, Jack highlighted. Cheniere expects to play a prominent role in this regard from our life cycle analysis and the cargo emission tags and our QMRV collaboration, we aim to offer increased environmental transparency while providing low emission solutions and competitively structured products for our buyers. Thank you all for your time. I'll now turn the call over to Zach, who will review our financial results and guidance. Thanks, Michael. Good morning. Yes. In short, the market is growing maturing and we expect to see all of the above in greater quantities. We're in the camp that the traditional SPAs long-term are part and parcel of this business and is required for us, for example, to commit capital. And we think that our commercial creativity is one of our main calling cards, right? We introduced the IPM business now over two years ago, and that's a business where the producer gets exposure to those international indices, we collect our fixed fee and the producer passes allows for that commodity exposure to their underlying resource. So we think all of this stuff is part and parcel of the business going forward. You'll see traditional SPAs and you'll see as we mentioned, a lot more midterm business from us that we've been so successful with since we launched it less than a year ago. Yes. Thanks, Jack. Thanks, Jeremy. We've been fairly bullish on the markets in the first half of this decade and saw 2021 as a transition year, as we've touched on previous calls that transitioned faster than we expected, kind of across the board. Asia's rebound and demand growth and all of this investment that we saw on gas infrastructure and LNG infrastructure and demand is playing out arguably faster than we expected. And in the aggregate, U.S. came to the rescue second half of last year and the first half of this year with additional volumes, but now everything is online obviously. We and everyone else are trying as hard as possible to bring this volume to market. And the market is still tight, right. Demand exceeded supply in Q2, which is why you saw the storage dynamics and the pricing dynamics that you mentioned. And we are only entering this phase of the market, as Jack said, this is the first time that in its tenure at Cheniere that is in the both part of the cycle for the sellers and long-term and mid-term commitments are accelerating as a result, right. It's not a surprise to anyone that this is playing out, but it is playing out a little bit faster. And Zach mentioned our comfort level with 2022 is that much higher. The other important component that you touched on, on the carbon side, and this is why the journey to get this LCA product out that that we announced this morning was so important. We are highly confident that we have a very low profile, low emissions profile product that will be a major contributor to emissions reductions in Europe, Asia, and everywhere that, that we structurally deliver our product into. So there's a mention of a case study in there that shows that our product reduces emissions by about 50% when displacing coal in China. And that is a great starting point on this journey that that we've announced this morning. So very optimistic about the structure of the market and our ability to offer these solutions both economically and environmentally. No, we're \u2013 Jeremy, as you mentioned, we're taking this leading role in developing these technologies and collaborating and creating the baseline from which improvements will be made over time. We're starting off at a great point. That's much better than what had been assumed and what is the national average that's \u2013 that is out there and with all of these efforts with our producer partners and our downstream partners, and of course at our own facility. As Jack said, we will continue to be laser focused on continuing to improve our emissions profile. We think that that's a key success factors as we compete in the energy transition. Yes. I would say thanks, Michael. We have a lot more appetite engagement traction I mean is only six, nine months ago where \u2013 when there was a \u2013 I would say a cadre of the industry that was thinking about remaining open for it's a sort of fundamental requirements and relying on the spot market that started to fade a quarter after that. And I think that that strategy is \u2013 has not been largely forgotten. So now it's about portfolio management, engaging and structuring a portfolio of mid-term and long-term volumes. And as a result of those conversations, the economics are stabilizing and firming. And you've seen that relatively openly in the slopes that you see on the Brent side, that that's an easier one to track, where we've come off those very low levels. And obviously the economics are stabilizing now for term commitments out of the NYMEX market as well. I think the dramatic changes in that market, in that spread played out probably two or three years ago. I honestly don't have enough precision to tell you if that's moved around a bit, but as Jack said there was a premium that the market will pay for certainty and our track record in history. As well as for early volumes that are included in that, that obviously greenfield can provide. So I just don't have enough precision to give you a good answer on that. Then you mentioned something about open capacity 2022 and hedging. And yes, besides those mid-term fields that already locked in around $400 million to fix margin next year, you can expect that the at this point in the year, we'll already hedging some of our capacity for 2022 in anticipation of giving you guys full your guidance in November, with $6 in there and $3 for the rest of the year. Yes. We're using some of our capital to the hedge out forward. Not quite that high, but yes, and shipping also just like the curves themselves has a seasonality. So winter shipping is higher than shoulder shipping. Well, Sean, thanks. It's Anatol. Look, it's a large portfolio Zack mentioned it's over 40 million tons now, and there are a number of positions that, that are managed in the aggregate. So it is exposure that we have and we are managing on behalf of our producer partners. And clearly there are synergies in that business with the downstream exposure that we manage on a day-to-day basis. So the short answer is, its part and parcel of the opportunity set that we have. Thanks, Craig. I have a spreadsheet in front of me that goes through that. And even with that spreadsheet in front of me, it's pretty hard to summarize. So look, as Jack mentioned in the prompt for the next number of years, it's market prices, right. And that, that obviously these sixes and threes that we've mentioned on this call filter through into those mid-term economics. So it depends on the tenor, but you should expect us to capture that that market or better for the relatively prompt volumes and then our long-term contract economics for the balance. So can those sprint above 2.5, if it's a relatively short tenor deal, of course, right. That's where the market is today. Yes. I just to follow-up on Jack's comments, 2020 was obviously an anomalous year, but even then you saw a fair amount of long-term contracting. And obviously 2018, 2019 were big years for the NYMEX market. And as we've discussed the margin environment and the window is clearly open for more of that engagement now. And I think we've viewed that that piece of the market is going to be volumetrically roughly similar to what it has been historically, just as the market grows, it'll be a smaller percentage of the total."

            "content": "Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today and thank you for your continued support at Cheniere. I'm pleased to be here this morning to review our results from the second quarter and our increased financial guidance for the full year of 2021. Please turn to Slide 5, where I will review some key operational financial highlights from the second quarter. The second quarter was an extremely productive one for us. As we achieved milestones across the enterprise and origination, marketing, operations and engineering and construction just to name a few. Global LNG market fundamentals continue to be extremely constructive and we have begun to see the return of long-term LNG contracts in support of the construction of new liquefaction capacity. For the second quarter, we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $1.023 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $340 million on revenue of over $3 billion. We generated a net loss of approximately $329 million due primarily to the unrealized derivative accounting treatment required on our hedges and on our integrated production marketing or IPM transactions, which is Zach will discuss in more detail in a few minutes. For the third consecutive quarter, we're raising our full year 2021 financial guidance. We now forecast 2021 consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion. This increase in guidance is being driven by a number of factors. First, the continued strengthening of the LNG market is yielding higher net backs unopened volumes. For context, since our first quarter earnings call in May spot margins for 2021 doubled and our portfolio optimization team has been able to capitalize on that with our open volumes. In addition, we've been able to further unlock some additional production for the second half of the year, primarily through maintenance optimization, which has contributed to an upwardly revised production forecast. And lastly, with Henry Hub moving higher over the past quarter, we make some additional lifting margin. So our outlook for the balance of 2021 has improved again based on a very strong LNG market and our very strong operational performance. The fundamentals present in the LNG market are as good or better than at any time since I've been at Cheniere. Anatol will cover the market in more detail in a few minutes. Our market dynamics on both the supply side and demand side continue to move in our favor and support our conviction in the long-term growth prospects for natural gas worldwide. Just after the quarter ended, we signed our third IPM agreement in support of Corpus Christi Stage 3, this time with Tourmaline, the largest natural gas producer in Canada. This transaction progresses our commercialization efforts on a shovel-ready Stage 3 expansion project, and helps validate our view of a constructive macro backdrop for long-term contracts. In addition, it reinforces Cheniere's record of executing collaborative, innovative solutions to meet the needs of our customers. We will continue to leverage our infrastructure platform and commercial advantages to further progress Stage 3 towards FID. During the second quarter, we continue to have meaningful success under our mid-term strategy, placing portfolio volumes into the market under various commercial agreements in increase in the percentage of our total volume that is contracted. So far in 2021, we've entered into fixed fee sales agreements for portfolio volumes with multiple counterparties aggregating approximately 12 million tons of LNG volume between this year and 2032 in addition to the IPM deal with Tourmaline. The success of this mid-term strategy underscores the strength in the LNG market today and this strategic competitive advantage of our portfolio volumes. We'll continue to place these flexible volumes in the market tailoring solutions to meet the growing requirements of LNG customers worldwide. On the production side, the record we set in the first quarter for LNG exports didn't stand very long as we broke that record in the second quarter with 139 cargoes of LNG exported from our two facilities. Year-to-date, Asia destination of Cheniere cargoes with approximately 45% of our cargoes exported having landed in Asia, followed by Europe with roughly 35% and Latin America with about 20%. South Korea and China are the top two countries importing our LNG so far this year. And those two alone accounts for over a quarter of all cargo deliveries. Our operations and maintenance teams at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi have done an exceptional job thus far in 2021, managing our operating plans to maximize asset availability and LNG production at our facilities, enabling us to increase our production forecast for the year all while ramping Corpus Christi Train 3 to full rates and stable operations quickly and safely. We look forward to the same performance with the addition of Sabine Pass Train 6 early next year. Thinking of Train 6, a significant milestone was met last month with the introduction of fuel gas into the train signaling the start of early commissioning activities. At the site 17 systems were turned over to the startup team in June another 12 in July with a project approximately 90% complete Bechtel continues to progress this project against an accelerated schedule. Turn now to Slide 6, I'll provide a brief review of Stage 3 in the Corpus Christi site overall as the Stage 3 project comes into focus with our recent commercial momentum and the constructive market we're in. As a reminder, our Stage 3 project at Corpus Christi is fully permitted and a fully constructed would have over 10 million tons of LNG capacity per year. Stage 3 enjoys brownfield project economics, as it will utilize a significant amount of shared infrastructure constructed as part of trains one through three, which we believe makes Stage 3 very cost competitive LNG capacity addition. As for the path to FID, we have said this before we will maintain our discipline to help ensure that the risk and return profile of Stage 3 is consistent with that or the first nine trains we've built. To that end, our origination team is focused on commercializing additional capacity from the project and we're working closely with Bechtel on front lines and the EPC contract. We remain committed to our growth capital investment parameters, which help ensure discipline in our capital investment decisions and the sanctioning of projects only when they meet the high standard we have set for all FIDs to date. Our excitement around the potential investment opportunities at the Corpus Christi site doesn't end with Stage 3. As you may recall, we have acquired approximately 500 acres adjacent to our existing site, which provides just with a platform for major future development potential. Any future capacity developed at this site, maybe designed to leverage the infrastructure already in place to provide substantial cost advantages. As you can see from the arrow of view as a land position at Corpus Christi, the site possesses substantial running room for growth well beyond Stage 3, and we may develop additional infrastructure there over time, especially at Stage 3 moves closer to FID. Turn now to Slide 7, last month, we were proud to publish our second annual corporate responsibility report entitled built for the challenge. This report the product of a deep cross functional effort across the entire company provides insight into key actions taken by Cheniere to ensure business resiliency in 2020 and beyond, and is the latest example of our transparency on ESG related issues and how we're building sustainability into our business model. Built for the challenge is a latest milestone in our ESG journey, which has seen tremendous progress in 2021. Highlights of achievements reach thus far through 2021 included the announcement of our cargo and mission tags, the climate scenario analysis we published our first carbon neutral LNG cargo we announced last quarter, our participation in the first ever study to measure methane emissions on an LNG carrier in our collaboration with leading academic institutions and several of our upstream natural gas suppliers to implement QMRV of greenhouse gas emissions performance and natural gas production sites across several bases. And finally, earlier today we announced the publication of our peer reviewed greenhouse gas lifecycle assessment or LCA, which utilizes greenhouse gas emissions data specific to our LNG supply and will be the foundational analytical tool to estimate greenhouse gas emissions to be included in our CE tags that we provide our customers. The items highlighted on the slide are all steps on a continuous path. And we look forward to leading our industry forward in this area helping to ensure the long-term sustainability of natural gas and helping all participants among the LNG value chain realize the full environmental benefits of our LNG. With that I'll turn the call over to Anatol who will provide some more details on recent LNG market development. Hey, Michael, I just wanted to add a little bit to Anatol answer to your question, and then we'll talk about Stage 3. So I would say, we're in the catbird seat, we have a great position. We're able to offer solutions for customers. We've been very successful on offering short-term, mid-term contracts to those customers that want those that don't use to grow the business. We're not in the FID business, we're in the making money business. So we're staying extremely financially disciplined on our next expansion project, just like we have on the first nine. But I'll turn it over to Zach to talk in more specifics on Stage 3. Well, thanks, Brian. And I have to say I'm so pleased with our operations and maintenance personnel and our ability to optimize our maintenance schedules and take advantage of what seems to be a very high price LNG market right now. But as far as the details of how it breaks down, I'll turn that over to Zach. Good morning, Jeremy. Well, I'll start and I'll hand it over to Anatol. The increased volatility and the higher prices just bring more and more customers to want to lock in their energy costs naturally and reduce the volatility to their customer base. So as you know, Jeremy, we focused on selling to end users, we sell most of our product to utilities around the world and they need it. And as more and more of these countries, try to meet their climate goals and clean up their air, especially in and around Asia, you're seeing the demand for that gas and the demand for LNG rise, fairly significantly and much greater than what was in any of our models initially, but I'll turn it over to Anatol. Look, I think the pathway to the energy transition is a very, very long road and it's going to need some of everything, a lot of everything, that, that, that we can develop today and 20 years from now. We embarked upon the journey back in 2018. We've spent well over the last three years working on a company specific lifecycle analysis in LCA that we published recently with American society of chemical engineers, but it's not \u2013 we're \u2013 our program has been very thoughtful and very forward thinking, and we're hoping to lead the industry into ensuring that our product is viewed as a sustainable provider of cleaner energy for the world. So that's what it's all leading to the life cycle analysis is extremely important for us to be able to produce our cargo emission tags or our carbon footprint per cargo for our customers. So we can help them strategize on whether or not what type of offsets, they would like to procure and the quantity those offsets. So \u2013 but \u2013 Anatol you have anything to add on? On the \u2013 the first one on the cost, so we're doing a lot of the work in-house, Matt. So we \u2013 the costs are born with our overall SG&A budgets, and there's a slight amount of a little bit of capital dollars, but it's insignificant. It's more of the just the in-house expertise on each of the different areas and our ability to help influence the market. And I'm actually looking at Corey Grindal so on the supplier side to make sure that, that we're getting good data, that, that we can quantify, monitor, validate, and report on that data and feel good that there's an auditable trail that, that we can stand behind both from our supplier side, from the midstream and processing folks through our own liquefaction treatment and then in shipping to our customers docs. I do think the carbon emission tags are necessary for first, most of our European counterparts. They've applauded us for doing it. They've been buying offsets themselves. And in most cases they're overbuying those offsets. So we \u2013 it just a part of doing business that we need to be able to quantify what the carbon footprint is of those of each and every one of those tankers for our customer base. Whether or not eventually we get paid a premium for having a clean cargo, we'll see how that market develops. Right now, there's just a lot of work, a lot of spade work that has to get done before we feel comfortable with actually marketing and selling a product like that. Michael, how are you? It depends on when it's going to begin also. So if you think about a term \u2013 if it's steep deed on a greenfield project is going to begin five years from now. It's probably priced at the marginal cost of the next investment or the next train, right. And if it's like more like a Cheniere portfolio contract that can begin now or next year or any time for that matter. And then you should expect it to be priced at the \u2013 at a higher level, right for more certainty. Thanks, Mike. It's not that easy volume weighted. I would say it's just inside of five years would be my guess. Thanks, Ben. And I have to say, we have a very strong relationship with Bechtel having completed nine trains and 45 million tons of liquefaction already. I have complete confidence in Bechtel that they can manage the project to its lowest capital costs out there. We haven't seen any inflationary environments at this point, but I'll turn it over to Zach and let him. Okay. So Julien, let me \u2013 I think I heard your first part of your question was on carbon and carbon sequestration and just carbon and 45... I had spent weeks ago, I spent a week \u2013 and I will tell anybody that, that $45 to $50 a ton is not going to cut the mustard for especially for post combustion carbon sequestration. It's not going to work and there's nothing technically yet that is that economical to make that happen. We do sit on top of a very deep, a very large sailing offer that would be looks to be geologically a good spot to sequester carbon dioxide, doing it though is a whole another challenge. So we're spending a lot of time and resources on categorizing, everything that can possibly putting a price tag to try and trying to see if four, five that works and so far it doesn't. So I \u2013 and I am remiss to say that I don't know why if I'm able to sequester a ton of carbon, that it's all, I only get $50 of ton, but if someone else uses direct air capture, they get 175 a ton. Or if I drive an EV are in Cheniere electric vehicle, I guess 450 a ton. None of that makes sense to me, if a price of a carbon molecules should be consistent and it should reward those of us that can do something to put the world in a better position, so. Thank you, Julien. Well, shipping curves have come way up also, James. You have to add, you can either add or subtract the shipping costs to either your JKM $16. You subtract it, or you add it to the $4, but shipping is not insignificant when margins get this high and everything is going to Asia that trip is a lot longer. Sorry. James, we're also talking about a curve through next year. We're not talking about like a news blurb on Bloomberg today, but like a trader printing a cargo. So just kind of thing... That's right. Not at this point, that 49 to 51 mtpa per train is the right one. And honestly, a lot of the outperformance this year is thanks to a really smooth ramp up of Train 3. So yes, we're still on that 49 to 51 range. I think your view is skewed to U.S. counterparties in those contracts. I think if you look globally, Craig, and you looked at the oil index contracts that are being signed almost daily, you'll see the market in the contracting market has been very lively. But if you're talking about just Henry Hub link, U.S. style markets are contracts than it's been less, but still pretty strong. I just want to thank everybody for your supportive of Cheniere. It's been an interesting time with the pandemic. Please be safe out there. Please get vaccinated. And we'll talk to you, I guess, in November. Thanks. Bye-bye."

            "name": "Zach Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Anatol, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our second quarter financial results and our increased full year 2021 guidance. Turning to Slide 13. For the second quarter, we generated revenue of approximately $3 billion, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $340 million, and a net loss of $329 million. As Jack mentioned, our results for the quarter were negatively impacted by the accounting treatment for our derivative instruments, which includes our IPM agreements. As we have discussed in prior quarters, our IPM agreements, certain gas supply agreements, and certain forward sales of LNG qualify as derivatives and require mark-to-market accounting, meaning that from period to period, we will experience gains and losses as movements occur in the underlying forward commodity curves. This accounting treatment coupled with significant volumes, long-term duration and volatility in price basis for certain contracts. Most notably, our IPM agreements will result in fluctuations in fair market value from period-of-period. While operationally, we seek to eliminate commodity risk by matching our natural gas purchases and LNG sales on the same pricing index. Our long-term LNG SPAs do not currently qualify from mark-to-market accounting, meaning that the fair market value impact of only one side of the transaction is often recognized on our financial statements until the sale of LNG occurs. The unfavorable pretax impact from changes in the fair value of our commodity and FX derivatives during second quarter of 2021 was approximately $672 million. Most of which was non-cash, but was the primary driver of our recognized net loss for the second quarter. For the second quarter, we recognized in income 522 TBtu of physical LNG, including 508 TBtu from our projects and 14 TBtu from third-parties. Approximately 80% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SPAs or from volumes procured under our IPM agreements. We received no cargo cancellations and had no impact to revenue recognition timing related to cargo cancellations in the second quarter. We received $36 million related to sales of commissioning cargoes in the second quarter from LNG, which was in transit at the end of the first quarter, corresponding to 6 TBtu of LNG. As a reminder, amounts received from the sale of commissioning cargoes are offset against LNG terminal construction and process. Net of the cost associated with production and delivery of those cargoes. As you may recall, we established an initial debt reduction for 2021 to pay down at least $500 million of outstanding debt. During the second quarter, we fully repaid the remaining outstanding borrowings under Cheniere's term loan and fully repaid Cheniere's convertible notes due May 2021. With $500 million of cash on hand and the remainder about $130 million from borrowings under the CEI revolver. So as of June 30, we have already achieved our minimum full year goal of $500 million in debt reduction. With our cash flow profile only improving in the back half of the year, we were poised to exceed that amount this year, along with broadening out our capital allocation plans. Continue with the balance sheet management, since our last call, we have locked in a further $200 million of long-term amortizing fixed rate notes at SPL on a private placement basis with multiple counterparties. Year-to-date, we have locked in approximately $347 million of Dutch, which will fund on a delayed draw basis in late 2021, and will economically refinance a portion of SPL outstanding 6.25% notes due 2022. This continue progress on prudently managing the balance sheets through the near structure, which goes hand-in-hand with our efforts on execution and operational performance was once again recognized by the credit rating agencies during the second quarter. As S&P global ratings change the outlook on the credit ratings of both Cheniere and CQP to positive from negative, as we mentioned on the May call. S&P side of the EBITDA and cash flow growth resulting from the successful completion of eight trains, the accelerated schedule of train sticks and the expectation of significant improvement in leverage levels over the next two years, as we execute on our stated deleveraging plans. Jack and Anatol have both discussed the success we've had so far in 2021 on marketing and origination with 12 million tons of midterm deals done as well as the recent 15 year term, terminally IPM transaction. The execution of these transactions not only brings stage three integrator focus, but also supports our long-term balance sheet management priorities by bringing significantly increased cash flow visibility out into the 2030s, given the fixed fees that have always been the bedrock of our commercial strategy. Aggregating the mid-term and IPM transactions we've completed year-to-date, we have sold approximately 25 million tons of LNG, which will generate over $3 billion in fixed fees into the next decade, which clearly has de-risked our cash flows further. Turn now to Slide 14. As previously mentioned, today, we are increasing our guidance ranges for full year 2021 consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributed cash flow by $300 million and $200 million respectively. Bringing total increases to $700 million and $600 million respectively. Above the original ranges we provided in November of last year, our revised guidance ranges are $4.6 to $4.9 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion in distributable cash flow. Today's increase in guidance is largely driven by the continued improvement in global LNG market pricing and our ability to capture higher net backs on our open portfolio volume. Our production forecast, we have again revised upward due primarily to maintenance optimization. And lastly, some added lifting margin due to higher Henry Hub prices. DCF guidance isn't moving up quite as much as EBITDA guidance, due to some incremental EBITDA accruing at CQP and SPL, where we have accelerated capital spend at Sabine since Train 6 is ahead of schedule. So we expect to realize the benefits over time in DCF as CQP is distributions increased further in the coming years, once fully operational. When we updated guidance on the last call, one of the primary drivers was an improvement in market margins from approximately $2 in February to approximately $3 in May. Since then, that margin has gone up by another over $3 and our production forecast as increased as well. Incremental volume that's been added to the production forecast is all in the third and fourth quarters. And although, it's single digit number of cargoes in terms of quantity, the impact on the financial forecast is meaningful with net packs where they are. We currently forecast the dollar change in market margin would impact EBITDA by less than $25 million for the rest of the full year 2021. As we have now sold almost all of our production for the remainder of the year, we would only provide another update if that were to change materially. As well, given a little remaining exposure to the market we have, we are confident in our ability to deliver results within these upwardly revised guidance ranges for the full year. While we don't guide to free cash flow for over a year now, we've described 2021 Cheniere's cash flow inflection point, another certainly materializing and the results we've generated so far this year and in our forecast for the balance of the year. Entering 2021, we forecasted free cash flow at around $1 billion for the year. As DCF guidance has moved up $600 million in the subsequent six months, it's reasonable to think our FCF forecast has moved up largely in lockstep with DCF, so over $1.5 billion. This incremental cash flow puts us in a great position from a capital allocation perspective, especially, as we work to finalize our comprehensive capital allocation strategy and framework. With that process nearing completion, we expect to be able to provide that to you in the coming months and before the 3Q earnings call in early November, where we will provide you with a first look at 2022 guidance. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions. Sure. Hey, Michael. So I'll just start off the saying last November, Jack mentioned that we were around 85% contracted and at this point we're 90% with all the work that the marketing team has done. And when you think about 90% on a 45 million ton book, that's a little over 40 million ton, our contracted at this point. So we're actually pretty darn close to considering a FID of Stage 3 and why we're so confident about doing that next year. But as noted, as Jack mentioned, it's all about our discipline approach to just major capital investments, meaning it's not just about the volume, but about the returns on both the levered and unlevered basis from a highly contracted cash flow. So that when we thanks in a project, it's value and credit accretive and the very, very best use of our cash. But with that all in mind, it is around, let's say, four or so mtpa of additional contracting to underpin all of Stage 3, ensure our run rate contracted capacity remains in that 80% to 90% range, even at FID. And of course all the investment parameters are met. So again, we're pretty confident that a 2022 could be a big year for us. Hey, Brian. So the $300 million upward move in guidance is pretty simple. It's three things. it's higher net backs, a bit more production and better lifting margin, but to be clear higher margins on the open capacity and some additional production where the vast majority of the guidance rage. So with the dramatic rise in CMI netbacks since early May from literally just under three bucks to over $6 today for the rest of the year. And with that 40 CBQ previously open that added almost 150 million of that raise. Then combine that with another, let's say, four or so cargoes from opportunistically managing maintenance for the rest of the year to take advantage of these current market conditions. And that added alone another $100 million. And the rest with just higher Henry Hub prices for the rest of the year, as we expect to literally lift every last drop of LNG, lifting margin made up most of the rest. And that simply gets you $300 million or so. Sure. I mean, put it this way. We're going to have $3 billion of BCF per year, and now with how the markets have improved and the curves have improved around $13 billion of available cash through 2025. And the equity check for something like Stage 3, which let's say it's around the mid-$3 billion range for the whole thing, is only about 800 million per year, once funded 50-50 with debt and equity, pro rata over time. So as you can see in the results, we're pretty much at a point in our life cycle, where we can undertake the project with the scale of Stage 3 and not be limited whatsoever from also meeting all of our balance sheet and shareholder capital return goals over the coming years. So nothing's really holding us back at this point. Sure. I'll give you a little bit, but we plan to present that to you really in on the next call in November, after we go through the 2022 budget process, but it's really going to come down to where margins are going to be for the winter, and then just timing with how Train 6 commissioning comes along in the first half of the year, but at the rate can SPL construction is going and with margins for 2022, right now, above $6 for the winter and over $3 for the rest of the next year. It's looking likely that EBITDA should be over $5 billion for 2022 if things don't move too much from here. So we're obviously getting closer and closer to run rate. I think I just go back to what Jack said, first and foremost, we're here to create maximum value for LNG shareholders period. So it's not just about the next FID or signing a contract for the sake of FID to win some race for the lowest price FID or the highest risk FID, I'm sorry, high risk SPA. So luckily with the funnel that Anatol and the team has, we think we're just going to be clipping fix fees for a vast majority of our volume that will meet all of our investment parameters. And it's going to be a mix of IPM, DS and FOB deals with each and every one with a credit worthy counter-party and fixed fees for a long, long time. We can't really speak to other business models. That's our business model and we're sticking to it. I was just going to add, when we're talking about those mid-term deals, we didn't mention that all the deals we signed at is about $3 billion of fixed fees through the early 2030s. But just thinking about how much de-risking of our cash flows has just occurred over the past quarter. We now have locked in this year, fixed fees for about $400 million just in 2022 and comfortably over $1.5 billion through 2025. Just to give you perspective of how much has really been locked in the past quarter or so. Yes. Just to reiterate, we don't really see material risks on the cost side and we're actively pursuing all opportunities through the \u2013 really the end of this year to make it as price competitive as possible. But I'll just say we feel really good to meet all of those investment parameters based on the contracts we're seeing and just the synergies we have with Corpus Trains 1, 2, 3. And that let's say approximately six times multiple on CapEx to EBITDA is still the right one give or take for the full project. Technically they would, but we think it's going to be a mix and keep in mind, we already have a few contracts that are sitting at CMI and not allocated to a project yet, that, that are DS. So not everything will be IPM for sure, but again, it all comes back to credit worthiness, and a fix fee, and the capability to either deliver us the gas, or pick up the LNG and pay us that fixed fee as a percent of their EBITDA and these counterparties like Tourmaline check all those boxes."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Randy Bhatia, VP of IR. Please, go ahead, sir. \nRandy Bhatia: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Cheniere's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. The slide presentation and access to the webcast for today's call are available@cheniere.com. Joining me this morning are Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO; Anatol Feygin, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Zach Davis, Senior Vice President and CFO. Before we begin, I would like to remind all listeners that our remarks, including answers to your questions. may contain forward-looking statements. And actual results could differ materially from what is described in these statements. Slide two of our presentation contains a discussion of those forward-looking statements and associated risks. In addition, we may include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measure can be found in the appendix to the slide presentation. As part of our discussion of Cheniere's results, today's call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP or CQP. We do not intend to cover CQP's results separately from those of Cheniere Energy Inc. The call agenda is shown on slide three. Jack will begin with operating and financial highlights, Anatol will then provide an update on the LNG market and Zach will review our financial results and guidance. After prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO.\nJack Fusco: Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today and thank you for your continued support of Cheniere. I'm pleased to be here this morning to review our outstanding results from the first quarter. Before covering our results and outlook, I want to spend a minute addressing winter storm Uri and its impact on Cheniere. As we described back in February, we were impacted by the widespread power outages in Texas, which resulted in our Corpus Christi facility being down for a few days. I'm extremely proud of our operating personnel at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi for rising to yet another weather challenge and working so diligently to manage our operations smoothly throughout the freeze event. From hurricanes the fog, to now historic freezes, the Cheniere platform has withstood whatever Mother Nature throws our way and our focus on safe and reliable operations continues to benefit our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders. As a result of the winter storm, there was no material impact on our assets or operations and we were able to fill some cargoes at Sabine Pass and restore Corpus Christi to normal operating levels quickly, to mitigate impacts on our delivery obligations. We did recognize a financial benefit as a result of some optimization activity in the period leading up to the storm. But the magnitude of that benefit is not material to our expected full year 2021 financial results. More importantly, the global LNG market has recovered significantly for 2021 and beyond, as demand has outstripped supply, resulting in higher prices, even during the shoulder and summer months. I continue to believe in the long-term viability and sustainability of LNG as an essential fuel source in the low-carbon future. Please turn to slide five, where I will review some key operational and financial highlights from the first quarter, including our upwardly revised 2021 guidance. After delivering on our 2020 guidance, despite a myriad of challenges, we continued our momentum into the first quarter and are off to a fast start. Now, full year 2021, is looking even better for us, than it did on our last call in February. For the first quarter, we generated approximately $1.5 billion of consolidated adjusted EBITDA, approximately $750 million of distributable cash flow and almost $400 million in net income on revenue of approximately $3.1 billion. We've often described 2021 as Cheniere's cash flow inflection point and you can see progress on that early in the year in our first quarter financial results. Zach will cover these numbers in more detail in a few minutes. During the first quarter, we exported a quarterly record of 133 cargoes of LNG from our two facilities, with production incentivized by strong global LNG margins during the quarter and we had the benefit of Corpus Christi Train 3 commissioning volumes. This record production is also despite Corpus, being down a few days, as a result of the winter storm in February. A sustained stronger LNG margin environment, together with our results for the first quarter, contribute to our ability to raise our full year 2021 financial guidance for the second consecutive quarter. Our outlook for the balance of the year has improved since our last call in February, with a slightly higher production forecast, augmenting the impact of the improved LNG margins, we see throughout the balance of the year. We now forecast consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $4.3 billion to $4.6 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion for the full year 2021. Near the end of the quarter, Train 3 at Corpus Christi achieved substantial completion within budget and in line with the accelerated time line, we've previously communicated. With the completion of Train 3, the Cheniere and Bechtel relationship has now delivered eight LNG trains ahead of schedule and within project budgets, which is truly world class execution. And that execution excellence continues with our ninth train. As construction on Train 6, at Sabine Pass, continues to progress against accelerated schedules. The estimated substantial completion time line has accelerated once again. Substantial completion is now projected to be achieved in the first half of next year. As I hope, you all saw this morning; we issued a press release, announcing we supplied a carbon-neutral LNG cargo to Shell, whereby Cheniere and Shell jointly offset the full life cycle emissions of a cargo. The carbon offsets covered full life cycle emissions from the wellhead, through consumption, with Cheniere delivering the cargo to Shell FOB at Sabine Pass and Shell delivering the cargo to a European regasification facility. This first carbon neutral cargo is another step in Cheniere's environmental efforts I've discussed over the past several months. Our efforts emphasize enhanced transparency, as a critical step towards improving environmental performance and maximizing the benefits of our LNG, for Cheniere, our customers and our value chain partners. Today's carbon neutral cargo announcement, follows our February announcement of cargo emissions tags development. The response to our CE tax from current and prospective customers has been extremely positive and has spurred further engagement. Our focus is to ensure the long-term benefits of natural gas as an affordable, reliable and clean energy source for the world. Turn now to slide 6, where I'll discuss what I'm seeing in the market today and why I'm so optimistic about Cheniere's future prospects. In the short-term market, we're beginning to see the impact of the structural shift to natural gas as a primary energy source for the world as evidenced by the global LNG demand growth we saw in 2020 despite the pandemic. There was constructive LNG demand tension between Europe and Asia earlier this year that left some countries short of natural gas. In addition, South America is entering its winter demand month and is contributing to the tightness in the global LNG market. With natural gas storage below normal levels in Europe and precious little new supply entering the market this year, we also have a constructive backdrop in the LNG market for the balance of this year and into next year in 2023. With Corpus Christi Train 3 completed very early and the completion time line for Sabine Pass Train 6 recently accelerated again to the first half of next year. We are ideally positioned to benefit from these near-term market dynamics. In the longer term, the supply and demand fundamentals in the global LNG market are even stronger and reinforce our confidence in the value of our existing platform and in our ability to commercialize our Corpus Christi Stage III expansion project. In the four-year period from 2017 to 2020, the global LNG market added almost 120 million tons of capacity, an average of almost 30 million tons per year. In the subsequent four-year period that average is expected to drop to approximately 11 million tons a year, a significant slowdown in supply growth, which will be amplified by output declines from older legacy projects. On the demand side, the structural shift to gas on a global basis is evidenced by the near-term doubling of LNG importing nations in the last 10 years and hundreds of billions of dollars of natural gas oriented infrastructure being built around the world today. LNG consumers recognize and value LNG's flexibility, reliability, affordability and the critical role natural gas plays in improving environmental performance and achieving decarbonization goals. We forecast that global LNG trade will approximately double expanding by approximately 350 million tons per annum to over 700 million tons per annum by 2040, which would support additional approximately 225 million tons per annum of incremental global supply. Our constructive long-term view on the LNG market was recently reinforced for the results of a comprehensive climate scenario analysis we conducted with a leading global management consulting firm. We published this analysis last month and it's available on our website. This study analyzed Cheniere's business over the long-term under various energy transition scenarios and concluded that even under the most aggressive energy transition scenario analyzed, demand for LNG and natural gas is expected to grow for decades to come. In that not only are Cheniere's existing assets well-positioned to take advantage of that, but new LNG capacity will be needed to meet that demand. With regard to Cheniere specifically, our accomplishments and progress over the past five years of LNG operations have been nothing short of transformative and position the company to take full advantage of the constructive market, we see in front of us. We have established ourselves as a premier LNG operator, demonstrating LNG buyers worldwide the reliability and certainty associated with a long-term supply agreement with Cheniere. In addition, our continuous improvement efforts have yielded efficiency gains and debottlenecking has unlocked a significant amount of extremely cost-effective volume across our projects, which further improves our competitive position and increases financial returns. As construction ramps down, the long-awaited financial results of our multiyear capital programs are bearing fruit as evidenced by today's results. This year, we expect to generate well over $1 billion of free cash flow, and we are quickly approaching our expected run rate metrics. Our run rate forecast of $11 per share, and distributable cash flow not only has a high degree of visibility, but also empowers us to execute on an all of the above strategy for capital allocation, which includes achieving investment-grade credit metrics, funding a significant portion of Corpus Christi Stage 3 with cash flow after that project is commercialized, and returning significant capital to shareholders, via buybacks and dividend. Zach and his team, and I are working diligently with the Board and the rest of management on our detailed capital allocation plans, which we will communicate to you later this year. I'm excited about what we are seeing in the LNG market, how Cheniere is positioned to capitalize with our portfolio volumes, a shovel-ready brownfield expansion project, commercial offerings tailored to customers' needs, and an improving credit and cash flow profile. With that, I'll turn the call over to Anatol, who will provide some more details on recent LNG market developments.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide 8. The global LNG market exited 2020 on a positive note, as cold weather across Asia and continued economic expansion in China helped contribute to an increase in Asian LNG imports in Q4. As non-US supply was slow to respond, markets tightened as Asia pulled cargoes from Europe, a trend which continued in Q1 of 2021. In the first quarter, global LNG supply showed positive year-on-year growth for the first time, since the first quarter of 2020, but net growth was modest as a healthy 17% growth in US exports, was largely offset by declines at several LNG facilities around the globe, which were either shut down or underperforming, including facilities in Norway, Nigeria, Australia, Trinidad and Tobago, and Russia. Extreme cold weather in Asia and then Europe during the first quarter combined with the supply constraints and a tight shipping market caused unprecedented price spikes in JKM in the early part of the quarter, to all-time highs of over $30 in January. Since then extreme temperature conditions have passed and JKM prices have moderated. However, price levels are still well above where they were a year ago, with March JKM settling at $8.26, and June trading above $9 currently. Well above prices around the $2 in MMBtu level a year ago, indicating an underlying structural tightening of the market, supported by strengthening demand fundamentals. As I just mentioned, in Asia LNG imports were very strong in Q1 up over 7 million tons or 11% year-on-year. China added nearly 5 million tons of LNG demand despite robust domestic gas production and increased Russian pipeline gas imports. Early reports of total gas demand in China, show an increase of approximately 15% year-on-year in Q1. Weather continued coal-to-gas switching and a remarkable over 18% increase in Q1, GDP drove the demand increase. In the Japan, Korea, Taiwan area LNG imports increased 8% or 3 million tons year-on-year, due partly to scheduled nuclear and coal outages. From a structural demand level, 10 years after the Fukushima earthquake most Japanese nuclear plants remain offline with only 9 units totaling 9.1 gigawatts resuming operation as of Q1, 2021 compared with 42 gigawatts in 2010, solidifying LNG as a critical fuel for the stability of the energy system in Japan and in the region as a whole. In Europe gas demand in major markets rose by 9% year-on-year during Q1 and stronger heating and gas-fired power demand. Significant draw-downs from storage through winter and into April has left European storage approximately 34 BCM or around 50% lower than the prior year by the end of April and approximately 11 BCM or approximately 375 Bcf below the 5-year average. To attract LNG volumes away from Asia to help replenish storage, TTF prices remain elevated. April TTF settled higher than JKM at $6.46 an MMBtu that was 13% higher on the month and up almost 200% year-on-year. Current prop margins are in the $3 range, inclusive of a dramatic upward shift in charter rates from the $30,000 a day range well above the $80,000 a day range today. Based on these demand fundamentals although specific conditions during the first quarter led to ssome dramatic LNG price volatility, we believe we have also seen indications that the structural tightening that we've been predicting for some time is now underway. As such, we have continued to transact incremental volumes aligned with our midterm strategy. The team has secured an additional approximately 1.7 million tons locking in over $200 million in fixed fees across 2022 and '23. We see strong appetite for midterm agreements as both intermediaries and end users add diversity security and flexibility to their portfolios. Turning now to Slide 9 where I will discuss some longer-term aspects of the market. We've discussed over the last few years that we viewed 2021 as a transition year to a tight market. And as we just described that has played out somewhat faster than we expected. Forward margins today during the Northern Hemisphere Spring shoulder season are higher than they have been at any point for this season since we began operating just over five years ago. A number of market conditions that have been headwinds to entering into long-term commitments have more recently become tailwinds. And such as oil price, prompt margins and forward supply growth just to name a few. We remain quite sanguine on the long-term contracting market for our products over the coming quarters and years as the demand for LNG will continue to increase over time with many current markets expanding and new markets continuing to be added. Specific to Asia, along with China and India markets in South and Southeast Asia have shown keen interest in expanding their natural gas infrastructure from pipelines to power plants to support their rapidly growing economies. In power generation, forecast suggests that gas is expected to be the second highest growth segment after renewables in terms of capacity additions. The need to expand access to reliable energy across the region means that natural gas is expected to play a crucial role in ensuring sustainable economic growth, while reducing emissions intensity. Of the roughly 3,000 gigawatts of forecast incremental power generation capacity in Asia by 2040 over 300 gigawatts is expected to be gas fired. Just for reference, a gigawatt of combined cycle natural gas generation operated as baseload requires approximately 1 million tons of LNG per annum. A significant portion of that sum will be in China, but almost half of it is expected to satisfy growth in South and Southeast Asian countries such as India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Vietnam and the Philippines. Some of these countries are already well-established gas users with indigenous resources which are mature and declining. Data from Wood Mackenzie suggest that the region could lose more than 20 Bcf a day of domestic output by 2040, and while current upstream developments are considered unlikely to offset more than just a small fraction of that decline. In addition, gas demand in the region is currently expected to grow by at least 18 Bcf a day during the period to 2040 creating a gap of more than 35 Bcf a day of gas, which we expect to be satisfied in large part by LNG. Again for reference, 35 Bcf a day is equivalent to approximately 250 million tons per annum of LNG. Please turn to slide 10. LNG demand growth across the various markets of South and Southeast Asia is in aggregate very significant. LNG demand growth in South and Southeast Asia is expected to accelerate and potentially grow fivefold by 2040 adding between 160 million and 200 million tons to global trade. We believe that over the next two decades, over 20% of the growth in Asian demand will come from China and approximately 70% will come from South and Southeast Asia as these countries prioritize gas over pull to secure economic growth and meet their climate goals. This region consumed over 17% of global coal and was responsible for more than one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2019. While most net zero pledges came from outside the region, we believe that nations in South and Southeast Asia have been increasingly determined to improve environmental performance and find ways to fuel growth in a more environmentally sustainable manner. We see Cheniere's LNG as a secure, reliable and cost-effective fuel for the region and which along with renewables will displace more polluting fuels. Jack already touched on our leadership and initiatives in ESG, and I'll just add that we are seeing increasing interest and engagement from both existing and potential customers on the environmental opportunities we are developing. Cheniere stands ready to work with customers in the region and all over the world to create practical solutions that fit their commercial needs and satisfy global environmental imperatives. We believe our low emitting LNG standards will play a role in supporting the region's environmental goals and its energy priorities. Thank you all for your time. I'll now turn the call over to Zach, who will review our financial results and guidance.\nZach Davis: Thanks Anatol, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our first quarter financial results and key financial updates, as well as our increased 2021 guidance. Turning to slide 12. For the first quarter, we generated net income of $393 million, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.5 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $750 million. Our financial results for the first quarter were positively impacted by increased global LNG prices and margins, particularly margins realized on spot and short-term cargoes sold through our marketing affiliate and a higher than normal contribution from LNG and natural gas portfolio optimization activities due to significant volatility in LNG and natural gas markets during the quarter.  As we have discussed in prior quarters, our IPM agreements, certain gas supply agreements and certain forward sales of LNG qualify as derivatives and require mark-to-market accounting, meaning that from period to period, we will experience non-cash gains and losses as movements occur in the underlying forward commodity curves. The impact of shifts in these curves on the fair value of our commodity and FX derivatives during first quarter 2021 was a net loss of approximately $120 million, which was substantially all non-cash.  For the first quarter, we recognized an income 456 TBtu of physical LNG, including 442 TBtu from our projects and 14 TBtu from third parties. 84% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SPA or IPM agreements. During and after this winter storm, we were able to work with our long-term customers on cargo schedules as well as shift some volumes from Corpus to Sabine, leading to no material impact to our production for the quarter.  We received no cargo cancellation notices and had no revenue related to cargo cancellations in the first quarter. However, we previously recognized $38 million of revenues during fourth quarter 2020 related to canceled cargoes that would have been lifted in the first quarter.  Commission activities for Corpus Train 3 went well as Jack discussed and we received $191 million related to sales of commissioning cargoes in the first quarter, corresponding to 25 TBtu of LNG. As a reminder, amounts received from the sale of commissioning cargoes are offset against LNG, terminal, construction and process, net of the costs associated with production and delivery of those cargoes. 6 TBtu of LNG-related to commissioning activities was on the water at the end of the first quarter and will be recorded as an offset to construction in process upon delivery.  Turning to the balance sheet. We prioritized debt reduction since raising this near-term loan to refinance convertible notes last year and have committed to pay down at least another $500 million of outstanding debt in 2021. We made good progress toward that goal during the first quarter when we paid down $148 million in outstanding borrowings under the Cheniere term loan.  I'll provide some additional color in a few moments. But we are in an excellent position to reach and likely surpass our minimum debt reduction target this year. In February, we locked in an approximately $150 million private placement of long-term amortizing fixed rate notes at SPL, that are committed to fund in late 2021 at a rate of 2.95%, the lowest yielding bond ever secured across the Cheniere complex.  In March, CQP opportunistically issued $1.5 billion of 4% senior notes through 2031, the proceeds of which together with cash on hand were used to extend the maturity and accretively refinance all of CQP's 5.25% senior notes due 2025. Our efforts on execution, performance and prudently managing the balance sheet throughout the Cheniere structure continue to be recognized by the credit rating agencies.  As we mentioned on our last call, in February, Fitch revised the outlook of SPL's senior secured notes rating to positive from stable while reaffirming its existing BBB minus investment-grade rating.  In April, S&P revised the outlook of both Cheniere Engineered Partners BB ratings to positive from negative, a signal that ratings upgrades may be coming. In addition, S&P's commentary indicated a leverage level of 4.5 to five times on a debt-to-EBITDA basis in the next couple of years could be consistent with an investment-grade rating, commentary which is in line with and supportive of our deleveraging plan and goal of investment-grade credit metrics throughout the structure. Turning now to Slide 13. As Jack mentioned, today we are again increasing our guidance ranges for full year 2021 consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow by $200 million, bringing total increases to $400 million above the original ranges we provided in November of last year. Our revised guidance ranges are $4.3 billion to $4.6 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion in distributable cash flow. Today's increase in guidance is largely driven by our strong results in the first quarter, the continued improvement in global LNG market pricing and our ability to execute additional higher-margin forward sales into the stronger pricing. Since the last call, we have continued to lock in additional volumes for the remainder of the year. Though those sales have been offset by an upwardly revised production forecast, driven by maintenance optimization, some favorable weather, and a much faster than expected ramp-up to steady Train 3 volumes. We currently forecast that a $1 change in market margin would impact EBITDA by approximately $40 million for full year 2021. As we have now sold almost all of our production for the remainder of the year and have completed and placed Corpus Stage 3 into service in line with our previously forecasted timing. Our remaining exposure this year is not material and we only plan to provide another update, if that were to change. We are confident in our ability to deliver results within these upwardly revised guidance ranges for the full year. With Train 3 now in operation, we've also now passed the free cash flow inflection point, we have long discussed with our stakeholders. We expect to generate meaningful free cash flow this year for the first time in Cheniere's history of well over $1 billion. We originally committed to $500 million in debt reduction this year but we now think $500 million is conservative due to our strong performance and cash flow generation year-to-date and the forward sales of LNG, we have executed in a strong LNG market. We are continuing to work on our long-term capital allocation strategy with our Board and we anticipate communicating this multiyear plan to you in the second half of the year, including more comprehensive plans for the remainder of free cash flow this year after meeting our initial 2021 debt reduction goal of $500 million. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nJack Fusco: Good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Just want to start off with the kind of improving LNG market here and see what that could mean for Cheniere. It seems like you guys are able to kind of sign some more contracts here. So I'm wondering, how much visibility do you have? Do you think the market is tightening, where longer-term contracts might be at attractive rates that you would look to sign or even just looking at 2022, just how much spreads are you able to capture at this point kind of de-risk your outlook for 2022?\nJack Fusco: So Jeremy, this is Jack. I'll start, and then I'll turn it over to Anatol, and then Zach maybe. But we'll start off with -- first, like I'm extremely pleased with my operating staff and their ability to debottleneck and optimize our maintenance program. So during the freeze at Corpus, we were actually able to do quite a bit of maintenance on the facility. So, when we came back, we came back strong and we revised our production forecast and we found significant number of additional cargoes that we can monetize this year. And that's my expectation with the staff and the team is continuing to work on operating efficiency and our effectiveness and drive our production appropriately with market conditions. Anatol, Jeremy's question was around the market for, I guess, mid and long-term contracting.\nAnatol Feygin: Sure. Good morning, Jeremy. Things are, as we mentioned, turning around even faster than we had expected. Some of it is in a system from weather. Some of it is an assist from other facilities that are having operational issues and legacy production declines. We've talked at length over the last couple of years, quarters about the investment that's being made that, Jack mentioned in his remarks on the pipeline re-gas facilities, additional countries that are investing hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars in long-dated commitments to natural gas. And a lot of those places want to have security of supply. And one of the things as Jack mentioned, we've displayed is that through thick and thin through ups and downs, not only do we reliably perform on those commitments. Our product happens to have the lowest volatility, the most price stability of any of the other long-term contracting options. So, we're entering into a very good period. We are right around the same level that we saw in 2018 in terms of forward margins for the next three, four years. That was, as you know a very good period for us. That's not a necessary condition, but it's certainly very helpful. And the difference between 2018 and now is that was a bit of a countercyclical rally in the market that was driven by a surprising strength in demand out of Asia, primarily China, and frankly delays in terms of some infrastructure coming online like some of the other US projects. So, the difference now, as Jack said, 30 million tons a year, we're added 17 through 2020. You look forward through the middle of this decade. There's not a lot of supply coming in and we are very well positioned with these additional volumes that we're transacting in the short and mid-term. As you may recall, bridging volumes were a key part of our commercial offering and that's something that allows our customers and load serving utilities to sleep at night with that reliability and production. So again, feel very good about the hand that we're playing and feel very good about securing additional margin. And now, I'll hand it over to Zach to clean up.\nZach Davis: Sure. Thanks, Anatol, and hey, Jeremy. Today, we obviously aren't going to give you a look at our open capacity for 2022 yet. Really we have to get through that budget process. We have the annual delivery program or ADP process. And by November, we'll give you our best outlook for 2022 and the open position and probably have even a better sense of when trains fixed, is coming online. But you can expect we're already proactively thinking about it and executing on 2022 and the attractive margins now in the curve over the next few years. And with the success that CMI has had on terming out physically, including through mid-term deals, some of our debottleneck capacity. This has really helped lock in fixed fees this year for the next few years actually. And post-2021, we've already secured over let's say over $500 million and in just in 2022 over $200 million. So, you can say we've already been pretty proactive in locking up a portion of that open capacity for next year. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. Maybe just shifting to carbon here. I was just wondering if you could provide thoughts as far as this new transaction you did the value chain carbon neutral LNG cargo to Shell. How do you see that market developing? How much appetite do you think that could be for that over time? And when it comes to carbon capture do you think the current five Q provides sufficient economics for Cheniere to pursue CCS given the dense Purity stream of CO2 that come off LNG facilities? \nJack Fusco: Yes. Well, Jeremy thanks. And as I'll add is I was very pleased to work with Shell one of our largest foundation customers on that first carbon neutral cargo. And I think it's successful execution just ensures that Cheniere's capabilities ensures our capabilities to actually operate across the entire value chain. I think offering climate solutions to our customers is going to be a bigger and bigger portion of our business and right in line with what our value proposition is for the customer. As I've talked about before in the past our first goal though is to monitor validate and report on our carbon footprint. And that's when we announced our cargo emission tags or the CE tags. We're well on our way on that aspect of it. You mentioned CCS. CCS is important our initial blush is that it looks very promising at our facilities. I think we're committed and have committed some real dollars to development and engineering resource. To flush out CCs and its potential capability to help us both at Sabine and at Corpus Christi. But I think our customers are going to expect us to continue to offer a sustainable LNG product. Anatol do you have anything to add? \nAnatol Feygin: Thanks Jack. Just very quickly as Jack said transparency and our ability to offer that to our customers is very important. This is another arrow in our quiver and it is part of the comprehensive offering that allows us to capture -- to continue to capture market share. So, this is another box that we have checked in terms of our capabilities and we're grateful to have a partner like Shell as we navigate this and continue to develop our ESG offerings. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Thank you very much for the thoughts.\nJack Fusco: Thanks Jeremy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. \nShneur Gershuni: Hi, good morning everyone. I just kind of wanted to follow-up on the first question that was asked. Just given the fact that you've been successful negotiating incremental contracts into 2023 and kind of the volatility that we've seen and so forth and kind of the forecast that you laid out how close are we to securing enough contracts to give the board comfort in sanctioning Stage 3 to an FID process? And would you do it all at once, or would you do it kind of in a piecemeal type of approach?\nJack Fusco: So, just to be clear we are 100% focused on making sure that Stage 3 gets commercialized as soon as possible. But as I talked about, on previous calls, I mean, we literally have a virtual train of LNG that we need to sell and secure, which is what our mid-term product offering is helping us do. So through our de-bottlenecking efforts and maintenance optimization there was at least 7 million tons of LNG additional LNG coming off the portfolio, that we're blessed to have, quite honestly. So that's first and foremost, is making sure that we secure the existing nine trains worth of LNG, before we go off and build Stage 3 another 11 million tons. But I don't know, Anatol or Zach do you have anything to add?\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks for the question sure. We're -- again we're very optimistic. And this all contributes to our goals of increasing the contractual coverage. And we will not waver on our investment commitments which require roughly, we talk about this 1.7 million tons that's total tonnage over time. As Jack said, this is a $10-plus million ton project, plus the volume we have in the portfolio. Per annum, right? So you're talking about kind of an order of magnitude more commercialization that's required, but we feel very good about what we're seeing today and for the coming quarters.\nShneur Gershuni: Great. No. I appreciate the color. And maybe for a follow-up, during the quarter you prepaid $148 million on the term-loan, you've been able to issue debt at 4%. You've had positive outlook revisions from both S&P and Fitch. And you kind of touched on it on your prepared remarks. But I was wondering, if you can expand on the guidance or soft targets around leverage levels to get the upgrade to BB+ and then to investment grade. Any expanded discussion on that would be super helpful. Thank you.\nZach Davis: Hey, no problem. This is Zach here. And I think the S&P note last month for the outlook upgrade at CEI and CQP this really validates everything we've been communicating to you all for the last few years on capital allocation. And it's pretty consistent with how we step-by-step got our -- even our project ratings over time from high-yield to investment grade. That's the being in Corpus by every agency. And now looking ahead, there's a, I guess a defined path of EBITDA growth plus debt paydown to get below six times consolidated leverage to get to BB+ in the next year or so. And then leverage down to sub five times to get to BBB in the next few years. So our path is pretty straightforward to get to IG with S&P, as metrics improve and as we simply grow into our run-rate and follow through with capital allocation and debt paydown of up to $4 billion pretty much consistent with what we've told you. So that's the plan and that's on a consolidated debt-to-EBITDA basis.\nShneur Gershuni: Perfect. Thank you very much. Really appreciate the color. Take care, guys. Have a great day.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays.\nChristine Cho: Good morning. When I look at your shareholder list, I think there's probably still some turnover needed in the stock. Maybe it's lack of dividends or debt levels that keeping some of the investors out of stock. But as you think about capital allocation, how are you thinking about bringing new investment? As you talk to investors, who you like in the stock, but aren't currently what do they want? And how is that going to be factored into the broader framework that you're going to come out with later in the year?\nJack Fusco: Christine, it's good to hear from you. I'll start. And I'll turn it over to Zach. I am concerned about the lack of float that we've had in the stock lately. I mean, I think it's consistent with some of the oil and gas industry, overall, but I'd like to see the float get up a little bit more. I think larger investors, especially, index funds, at least in my experience, like to be able to get into stock and then get out of the stock without having too much pain. And so, we need to work on expanding our horizon and being more desirable for the investment community at large. And I think, a big portion of that is what Zach has highlighted is, getting our credit metrics under control. We don't screen very well on a Bloomberg screen. And we need to rectify that. We think we -- we're at an inflection point where we're going to have an opportunity here to give our shareholders back their investment. And we need to be thoughtful about it, which is why we're spending a lot of time trying to make sure that we get this capital allocation program done right the first time.\nZach Davis: And I'll just add to what Jack said, Christine. And I think it's pretty obvious, if we can get to investment-grade in the next couple of years, or even just get into the S&P 500 index it'd be helpful to bring more and more new investors into the stock. And I think it's pretty safe to say, we're on track for both of those with a bit more time. And it's probably time. That's the operative word for this company, because every day that goes by, we'll be making progress on our leverage get closer and closer to our run rate cash flows. And $11 is just going to be too hard to ignore.\nChristine Cho: Okay. Thanks.\nZach Davis: Especially, as that goes with capital allocation and growth. The other thing I'd note -- Christine, I'll just add one thing to that, is that it's more than fair to say that over time we're interested in attracting more and more income investors to the stock as well. But we know our leverage goes hand-in-hand with that, to ensure that any shareholder return really is just sustainable, not just for a few years but for decades. So I think the all-of-the-above type strategy to capital allocation, like Jack mentioned in the prepared remarks, is exactly what we're going to try to bring to you all in the next year or so.\nChristine Cho: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe if I can move on to contracting. In the last several weeks months, we've seen a number of long-term contracts signed in the market. And most of them have been with Chinese counterparties. So just curious, with no U.S.-China trade deal how should we think about interest from portfolio companies, especially with delays that are going on with other ongoing LNG projects that are in construction?\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Thanks, Christine. That's absolutely fair. It is a -- the market continues to contract for term. We've always been in the camp that long-term contracts are a key building block to this market, as it continues to grow and develop. And as we talked with Seer, it is a period -- we've gone through a period where oil indexation was more attractive to buyers than NYMEX. Now we're entering a period where we firmly believe the opposite will be true. We are quite optimistic on the Chinese market for gas and for LNG. We think this is a critical component of its economic and environmental objectives. 14th five-year plan continues to commit to that President Xi has committed to limit and actually decrease the amount of coal generation in subsequent five-year plans, which all bodes quite well for us. We're very proud of what we have done to date. We have a great commercial engagement with our Chinese counterparties, the SOEs and the Tier 2 and Tier 3 players and we fully expect to have more commercial success there. It is a very large and important market. As Jack has said in previous calls, it can double the size of Cheniere in and of itself. And we continue to be quite engaged there. But I will tell you one of the reasons we highlighted on this call non-China Asian markets is because there's there is a broad range of opportunities beyond China as well. So just like on capital allocation it will be all of the above. And again, we're entering now what we see as a multiyear period where NYMEX based contracting long-term contracting will be very attractive. \nChristine Cho: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. \nMichael Lapides: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question and congrats for good start to the year. Can you talk a little bit about Sabine 6, just like when you talk about bringing it up into the first half of 2022 are you talking just a couple of months ahead of what you were originally planning, or is it conceivable you could get it very early in the course of next year online? \nJack Fusco: Hi, Michael, it's Jack. And thanks for the kind words. Sabine Pass, which is what you would expect Train 6 is actually our Train number 9 with Bechtel. And I'd like to say we have figured out how to stick build these trains faster and better than probably anywhere else in the world. And it is way ahead of accelerated schedule probably close to a year ahead. So I would expect that barring decent weather because we are about ready to head into the hurricane season again, which seems almost never-ending anymore. But baring decent weather that we'll be producing LNG and commissioning on that train before the end of the year. And so we're hopeful that we can exceed the first half of the year guidance that we've given. And by November when we talk about 2022 guidance, we might be able to be more specific than just the first half of the year. But it's tracking in the right way right now. And in terms of cost there's $600 million to $700 million remaining of unlevered costs there before contingency and a large majority of that is this year. So things are really ramping up there. \nMichael Lapides: Got it. Super helpful. And then just trying to think about stage three at Corpus. Is there a material benefit in your, kind of, your cost to construct to be able to take that FID before -- basically before the major construction work that you've done over the last five-plus, seven-plus years with Bechtel kind of winds down. Meaning if Bechtel leaves the site does that make a material change in your sites plural does that make a material change to what stage three would cost, or put another way if you had a two year or three year pause before FID in stage three does that kind of change the outlook for the economics of it and the cost of it? \nJack Fusco: Not necessarily, Michael. For me it's more about the team. We got a great team at Cheniere, Bechtel has a great team supporting us right now. If there's that much of a delay, I'm sure those folks will get assigned elsewhere around the world. They're an international EPC contractor and they're not going to keep their people waiting. So for me it's more about the team and less about mobilization and demobilization costs because those are quite frankly, kind of, immaterial to the total investment. And I would just add that, we're partnering with Bechtel, as we speak actively looking at ways to make it cheaper and cheaper, and more cost competitive. So they'll be around.\nMichael Lapides: Okay. And then last one just real quick. You mentioned kind of doing short-term contracts one or two-year $200 million of incremental revenue roughly 1.7 million tons. Just real back of the envelope that's a little over $2 in MMBtu. I would assume that all kind of drops to the bottom line, or almost all drops to the bottom line?\nJack Fusco: Absolutely. That's the beauty of some of these midterm deals. It just gives us even more clarity on how much cash is available for the company to support capital allocation efforts as we give you guys an update later this year.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciate it.\nJack Fusco: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Hi, good morning. Qatar has taken some steps the last few months to move forward with their mega expansion. A lot of investors that I talked to that's their biggest worry is that Qatar could price low enough to keep any other new projects from moving forward? You're obviously in the market. So I just wanted to hear your comment on, if this price pressure is a real thing that you're seeing?\nJack Fusco: Anatol?\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks Jean Ann. It's Anatol. Every supply stack that, we've ever put together has our friends at on the far left. And there's no question that, that thing gets dispatched and gets built, but its 32 million tons, right? And as we've mentioned and Jack just mentioned, this market, when it was a smaller market grew at 30-plus million tons per year. So if you \u2013 as we look at that supply curve, and we've talked about this over the last year and half, there were a lot of things in that \u2013 we thought even a year ago were a foregone conclusion that now may not even materialize this year. The QP North field expansion, of course has been FID and we're always fully expecting that it will get placed into the market. It will be done on an oil index basis most likely. And it's one of our two main competitors that we see kind of as a foregone conclusion being in the market. So we're not afraid of that. We're part of the sort of diversification of supply and contracting structure along with QP and our friends at Novatek.\nJack Fusco: And Jean Ann, I would say that, Zach mentioned, we're working very closely with Bechtel to ensure that our expansion at Corpus Christi is the most competitive economic Henry Hub indexed expansion in the US.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Great. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, if you can disclose this and I apologize if it was in the early somewhere, but how much on a per MMBtu basis did the carbon neutral offset ad for the Shell cargo?\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Jean Ann. This is Anatol. We are not disclosing that. Again, we partnered with Shell on that, and Shell has the lead in using its methodology as we continue to develop our LCA and get that completely buttoned up pure reviewed et cetera. But those commercial terms and economics we are not disclosing.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Okay. No problem. That's all for me. Thank you.\nJack Fusco: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. Good morning everyone. I just had a really a clarification question on the midterm contracts you've been signing. Are you purposely signing these shorter-term contracts for your open capacity, or is that just what the market is willing to bear right now? And given the improving market fundamentals that you described earlier, do you see that changing at all?\nJack Fusco: Michael, midterm contracts have been around in this market forever. So we're not the first and only LNG provider to offer midterm contracts, but it's a great way for us to meet with some of increase our customer base and meet what their objectives are which -- and quite honestly compete with the Qataris or the Russians and -- or the French Total and offering these shorter term midterm contracts. So we found a pretty good appetite of customers. They are not traditionally I would say the customers the utility customers that we see on the long-term side. But there's a good market for that and that helps us manage some of these excess volumes from our production. Anatol?\nAnatol Feygin: And Jack, you covered everything. It's just another product in our portfolio one that we we're not offering in and of itself as recently as a year ago. We did do midterm contracts that were effectively stapled to long-term, but it is something that as Jack said helps us engage and broadens our commercial offering. And again, fully expect that long-term contracting will resume in short order given the current margin environment and where we are in the cycle.\nMichael Blum: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien, we are unable to hear you, please check your mute function. Okay. Our next question comes from Greg [Indiscernible].\nUnidentified Analyst : Thanks for squeezing me in and congratulations on the good quarter. Jack, did I hear you say Corpus Christi Stage 3 could be an 11 MTPA project? And then a related question any updates on further upsizing opportunities for the legacy nine train position?\nJack Fusco: Absolutely Corpus Christi Stage 3 could be 11 million-ton project. And that's currently as we continue to work on value engineering with Bechtel. We continue to drive not only the production of those trains, but also drive the cost down. Greg. And then I'm sorry I missed the last half.\nUnidentified Analyst: The rest was on debottlenecking, further debottlenecking on the nine trains.\nJack Fusco: Yeah. So we've the debottlenecking effort has went well above at least my expectations the team has just done a great job at I'd say picking the low-hanging fruit, but they -- and they continue to identify different choke points within the LNG liquefaction process that we can make modifications to continue to drive more output through it. So I do think there's more to come. We'll be giving you some guidance on that as we identify and feel comfortable that we can deliver it over the long-term.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Tsung with Webber Research.\nChris Tsung: Hi, good morning gentlemen. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to just touch on the color you're talking about for the supply curve. And are you able to provide any thoughts on the Mozambique LNG deferral with the projected debt size on 13 NTPA being deferred by at least a year, have you noticed any impact due to market? And has -- is there an impact for Stage 3 with that capacity? Thanks.\nJack Fusco: No. Look I only know about the Mozambique delay with what I read as well as what you read that from Total and Exxon. And it's a sad situation and I hope everybody is safe and healthy that were there to experience at unrest. But, no, I don't think it's -- I don't -- again it's a different business paradigm than what we offer. So we offer a full value product. The customer doesn't have to invest in equity. Customer doesn't have to worry about the E&P side of the business, because we've been able to buy at our peak almost 7Bs a day of U.S. nat gas from almost 100 different producers on 26 different pipelines and deliver it to our two facilities. So we take care of a lot of what the customer needs unlike them having to invest equity or be intimately involved in the E&P side of the business. But Anatol do you have anything to add on Mozambique?\nAnatol Feygin: No. Thanks Jack.\nChris Tsung: Right. No that's the point. It seems like the project is challenged and you guys are able to offer a product without equity, and you're able to deliver this product. So could you guys possibly be able to absorb some of that off-take or have discussions with those customers that are impacted as the project is delayed, what are your\u2026?\nJack Fusco: Absolutely. Most customers are interested in the diversity of supply and having a reliable supply of LNG and that's what we offer, but absolutely yeah.\nChris Tsung: Okay, okay. All right. And just one more on the -- I guess the ESG front, you guys introduced the cargo and mission tags early in February, and it looks like you guys were able to deliver your first carbon mutual cargo to Shell. It looks like these are measures taken to assuage the European businesses and customers with regards to the carbon intensity of your product. So I guess given -- I guess, how have those conversations change, or have they stayed consistent in the first half of this year?\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks Chris. This is Anatol. This is again continued progress by the team, the work that we have done over the last couple of years made us very comfortable with our environmental footprint and emissions footprint. And we are working on again quantifying, validating and having that properly assessed before we roll it out as you know in 2022, we are confident that we are part of the solution for decades to come. We just have to deliver on that transparency and that is something that we're working on. Obviously, the engagement with Shell, demonstrates steps in that direction as well. It is part and parcel of our commercial discussions and that we are -- we fully expect it to be an increasingly important component of those discussions. So, again dealt a very good hand that will continue to improve over time and contribute solutions as our customers move forward.\nChris Tsung: Great. Thanks so much and congrats on a great quarter.\nJack Fusco: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sean Morgan with Evercore.\nSean Morgan: Hi. This question is probably best for maybe Anatol. But last time, I talked to Anatol, we were talking about the disruption I guess to customers posed by the super spike that we saw with JKM. I think that maybe causes a little bit of difficulty in terms of customer assurance of signing long-term deals. But have you -- because you saw Henry Hub really hanging with a lot less volatility, is there any kind of demand response that you're seeing now the benefits Cheniere, that maybe more customers looking to sign up Henry Hub based price volumes because of the kind of consistency of pricing there?\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Sean. If I may redirect a little bit, what I think, we're discussing is, if we were in a world where natural gas prices, global natural gas prices spiked to such elevated levels, it could create long-term headwinds to natural gas' market share in the primary energy mix. What we've always said is that, that disruption that played out in the short-term spot market was a great advertisement if you will for long term contracting, right? Our customers enjoyed almost perfect reliability and almost perfect price stability over that period. And what's being highlighted now, as prices and margins have normalized is that, again, the attractiveness of a $3 minus-ish NYMEX product, plus our economics on the long-term side are very stable and very attractive and we think a key part of a diversified and flexible portfolio. So if anything just like some other price excursions that we've seen over the last couple of years, it continues to highlight the attractiveness of our turb commercial offering. And we're very well positioned for these coming years? Sean, did I lose you?\nSean Morgan: Sorry about that. Yes. Just going back to Mozambique real quick, I noticed that...\nJack Fusco: We're going to -- hey Sean, we're over on our time. So I'm going to go and we still have people in the queue. So, I'm going to ask that everyone left just one question please.\nSean Morgan: Sure. Thanks. Thanks, Jack.\nJack Fusco: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Nolan with Stifel.\nBen Nolan: Hi, thanks. Appreciate squeeze in here Jack. I wanted to -- and I apologize this is overly simplistic. But just sort of looking at the quarter, you did $1.5 billion of EBITDA, but then sort of extrapolating the guidance for the remainder of the year, it's only about $1 billion a quarter and that's even with not full contribution from Train 3 in the first quarter. Can I don't know Zach or anyone, can you maybe walk through how you're thinking about what the moving parts are to that level of guidance relative to sort of the performance in the first quarter?\nZach Davis : Sure. I think many folks smooth out our quarters over the course of the year and maybe that underestimated what many of you thought we would produce for Q1. But Q1, Q4 often the colder quarters of the year. They're not shoulder season. So there's less demand for LNG as well, and there's more volatility at the same time. All of that adds to higher EBITDA higher figures for the beginning and the end of the year. So this was as expected to us, and we've made it pretty simple that for the rest of the year there's only about 40 TBtu even open. When those cargoes are delivered, that depends on some of the FOB versus Des deals that we have. But this is right on track for where we thought we would be for Q1 with some additional optimization of higher LNG margins, and then for the rest of the year.  Q - Ben Nolan All right. Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Alex Kania with Wolfe Research.\nAlex Kania: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a follow-up on the Shell deal. Long-term as you just think about the European carbon market developing, we've seen higher prices there, and they\u2019ve potential for kind of import kind of tariffs, I guess, associated with carbon. Do you actually envision doing a carbon-neutral or carbon-free product kind of being value additive rather than just providing a good ARB rather than just getting a European buyer just pay more money for kind of for just kind of a generic premium, or is it going to ultimately be a positive for you guys just on an ARB basis? \nJack Fusco : Yes. Alex, I would say, first and foremost, in Brussels or in Europe is the US gas market is the most transparent market in the world. So the first thing we need to do is get our LCA done, get it published, get it reviewed by all the scientists of how we're going to calculate the life cycle emissions of the whole LNG train, because there's a lot of disinformation out there. And there is not a very good process for defining terms that everyone agrees to. So when we talk about transparency about monitoring, validating and reporting our carbon footprint that's in direct response to a lot of misinformation and miscalculation to say the least. And then secondly, I do think there's going to be a premium to carbon offsets and our ability to generate and produce carbon offset to help our customers, and those offsets need to be with their appropriate registrar. They need to be validated. I think it's all in line with what our offerings are for our customer and part of our business line and business proposition. But and I -- yes, I think the first go around will be European or a European customer is initially, but I think worldwide the whole industry will move this way. Go ahead Anatol.\nAnatol Feygin : Yes. Just to follow-up on Jack's points. We have very good engagement across the world on these issues and metrics. Europe has the most liquid and most transparent carbon emissions market. As you pointed out, it's trading around $60 a ton today. That is a very good sign of the benefits that the natural gas and to the extent that we're comfortable with our LCA and our emissions footprint. Cheniere's LNG is the value that can contribute to that market. But also good engagement really all over Asia as the world continues to focus and we continue to focus on improving our value chain and life cycle emissions profile that we're quite optimistic about. So kind of again, just like capital allocation all of the above. \nAlex Kania: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Carreker with US Capital Advisors. \nJames Carreker : Hi. Thanks for the question. Circling back to guidance. I was wondering if we could talk a little bit about what kind of change between now and the Q4 call? I think it was late February and the large spot price LNG spikes had kind of subsided. It was kind of post the storm. And I think you only had 50 TBtus of open capacity at that time. So kind of maybe can you talk a little bit about -- between now and then what has changed to yield $200 million have additional upside? \nZach Davis: Sure. This is Zach. And as you mentioned, we were able to raise guidance last time in February by $200 million. Our 200 TBtu of open capacity went down to 50 TBtu. And as the market went up, we were able to take advantage of that. Since that call, the rest of the year had been looking around $2. That's going up another dollar. And at the same time, our operations folks have been pretty opportunistic on the production. Just with the colder weather Train 3 actually ramping up pretty smoothly after March 26th and then just some opportunistic maintenance during the freeze and fog. That they added around 10 more cargoes to the forecast, that's over 30 TBtu. So when you add those two things together that gets to your $200 million pretty much. \nJames Carreker : Okay. And is there any amount of that you could quantify that's kind of gas optimization related to the storm? \nZach Davis: Not really, considering I just gave you a number that's maybe three, four if not more of a 200 move. \nJames Carreker : Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: And those are all the questions we have on today's call. That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Anatol Feygin",
            "content": "Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide 8. The global LNG market exited 2020 on a positive note, as cold weather across Asia and continued economic expansion in China helped contribute to an increase in Asian LNG imports in Q4. As non-US supply was slow to respond, markets tightened as Asia pulled cargoes from Europe, a trend which continued in Q1 of 2021. In the first quarter, global LNG supply showed positive year-on-year growth for the first time, since the first quarter of 2020, but net growth was modest as a healthy 17% growth in US exports, was largely offset by declines at several LNG facilities around the globe, which were either shut down or underperforming, including facilities in Norway, Nigeria, Australia, Trinidad and Tobago, and Russia. Extreme cold weather in Asia and then Europe during the first quarter combined with the supply constraints and a tight shipping market caused unprecedented price spikes in JKM in the early part of the quarter, to all-time highs of over $30 in January. Since then extreme temperature conditions have passed and JKM prices have moderated. However, price levels are still well above where they were a year ago, with March JKM settling at $8.26, and June trading above $9 currently. Well above prices around the $2 in MMBtu level a year ago, indicating an underlying structural tightening of the market, supported by strengthening demand fundamentals. As I just mentioned, in Asia LNG imports were very strong in Q1 up over 7 million tons or 11% year-on-year. China added nearly 5 million tons of LNG demand despite robust domestic gas production and increased Russian pipeline gas imports. Early reports of total gas demand in China, show an increase of approximately 15% year-on-year in Q1. Weather continued coal-to-gas switching and a remarkable over 18% increase in Q1, GDP drove the demand increase. In the Japan, Korea, Taiwan area LNG imports increased 8% or 3 million tons year-on-year, due partly to scheduled nuclear and coal outages. From a structural demand level, 10 years after the Fukushima earthquake most Japanese nuclear plants remain offline with only 9 units totaling 9.1 gigawatts resuming operation as of Q1, 2021 compared with 42 gigawatts in 2010, solidifying LNG as a critical fuel for the stability of the energy system in Japan and in the region as a whole. In Europe gas demand in major markets rose by 9% year-on-year during Q1 and stronger heating and gas-fired power demand. Significant draw-downs from storage through winter and into April has left European storage approximately 34 BCM or around 50% lower than the prior year by the end of April and approximately 11 BCM or approximately 375 Bcf below the 5-year average. To attract LNG volumes away from Asia to help replenish storage, TTF prices remain elevated. April TTF settled higher than JKM at $6.46 an MMBtu that was 13% higher on the month and up almost 200% year-on-year. Current prop margins are in the $3 range, inclusive of a dramatic upward shift in charter rates from the $30,000 a day range well above the $80,000 a day range today. Based on these demand fundamentals although specific conditions during the first quarter led to ssome dramatic LNG price volatility, we believe we have also seen indications that the structural tightening that we've been predicting for some time is now underway. As such, we have continued to transact incremental volumes aligned with our midterm strategy. The team has secured an additional approximately 1.7 million tons locking in over $200 million in fixed fees across 2022 and '23. We see strong appetite for midterm agreements as both intermediaries and end users add diversity security and flexibility to their portfolios. Turning now to Slide 9 where I will discuss some longer-term aspects of the market. We've discussed over the last few years that we viewed 2021 as a transition year to a tight market. And as we just described that has played out somewhat faster than we expected. Forward margins today during the Northern Hemisphere Spring shoulder season are higher than they have been at any point for this season since we began operating just over five years ago. A number of market conditions that have been headwinds to entering into long-term commitments have more recently become tailwinds. And such as oil price, prompt margins and forward supply growth just to name a few. We remain quite sanguine on the long-term contracting market for our products over the coming quarters and years as the demand for LNG will continue to increase over time with many current markets expanding and new markets continuing to be added. Specific to Asia, along with China and India markets in South and Southeast Asia have shown keen interest in expanding their natural gas infrastructure from pipelines to power plants to support their rapidly growing economies. In power generation, forecast suggests that gas is expected to be the second highest growth segment after renewables in terms of capacity additions. The need to expand access to reliable energy across the region means that natural gas is expected to play a crucial role in ensuring sustainable economic growth, while reducing emissions intensity. Of the roughly 3,000 gigawatts of forecast incremental power generation capacity in Asia by 2040 over 300 gigawatts is expected to be gas fired. Just for reference, a gigawatt of combined cycle natural gas generation operated as baseload requires approximately 1 million tons of LNG per annum. A significant portion of that sum will be in China, but almost half of it is expected to satisfy growth in South and Southeast Asian countries such as India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Vietnam and the Philippines. Some of these countries are already well-established gas users with indigenous resources which are mature and declining. Data from Wood Mackenzie suggest that the region could lose more than 20 Bcf a day of domestic output by 2040, and while current upstream developments are considered unlikely to offset more than just a small fraction of that decline. In addition, gas demand in the region is currently expected to grow by at least 18 Bcf a day during the period to 2040 creating a gap of more than 35 Bcf a day of gas, which we expect to be satisfied in large part by LNG. Again for reference, 35 Bcf a day is equivalent to approximately 250 million tons per annum of LNG. Please turn to slide 10. LNG demand growth across the various markets of South and Southeast Asia is in aggregate very significant. LNG demand growth in South and Southeast Asia is expected to accelerate and potentially grow fivefold by 2040 adding between 160 million and 200 million tons to global trade. We believe that over the next two decades, over 20% of the growth in Asian demand will come from China and approximately 70% will come from South and Southeast Asia as these countries prioritize gas over pull to secure economic growth and meet their climate goals. This region consumed over 17% of global coal and was responsible for more than one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2019. While most net zero pledges came from outside the region, we believe that nations in South and Southeast Asia have been increasingly determined to improve environmental performance and find ways to fuel growth in a more environmentally sustainable manner. We see Cheniere's LNG as a secure, reliable and cost-effective fuel for the region and which along with renewables will displace more polluting fuels. Jack already touched on our leadership and initiatives in ESG, and I'll just add that we are seeing increasing interest and engagement from both existing and potential customers on the environmental opportunities we are developing. Cheniere stands ready to work with customers in the region and all over the world to create practical solutions that fit their commercial needs and satisfy global environmental imperatives. We believe our low emitting LNG standards will play a role in supporting the region's environmental goals and its energy priorities. Thank you all for your time. I'll now turn the call over to Zach, who will review our financial results and guidance. Sure. Good morning, Jeremy. Things are, as we mentioned, turning around even faster than we had expected. Some of it is in a system from weather. Some of it is an assist from other facilities that are having operational issues and legacy production declines. We've talked at length over the last couple of years, quarters about the investment that's being made that, Jack mentioned in his remarks on the pipeline re-gas facilities, additional countries that are investing hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars in long-dated commitments to natural gas. And a lot of those places want to have security of supply. And one of the things as Jack mentioned, we've displayed is that through thick and thin through ups and downs, not only do we reliably perform on those commitments. Our product happens to have the lowest volatility, the most price stability of any of the other long-term contracting options. So, we're entering into a very good period. We are right around the same level that we saw in 2018 in terms of forward margins for the next three, four years. That was, as you know a very good period for us. That's not a necessary condition, but it's certainly very helpful. And the difference between 2018 and now is that was a bit of a countercyclical rally in the market that was driven by a surprising strength in demand out of Asia, primarily China, and frankly delays in terms of some infrastructure coming online like some of the other US projects. So, the difference now, as Jack said, 30 million tons a year, we're added 17 through 2020. You look forward through the middle of this decade. There's not a lot of supply coming in and we are very well positioned with these additional volumes that we're transacting in the short and mid-term. As you may recall, bridging volumes were a key part of our commercial offering and that's something that allows our customers and load serving utilities to sleep at night with that reliability and production. So again, feel very good about the hand that we're playing and feel very good about securing additional margin. And now, I'll hand it over to Zach to clean up. Thanks Jack. Just very quickly as Jack said transparency and our ability to offer that to our customers is very important. This is another arrow in our quiver and it is part of the comprehensive offering that allows us to capture -- to continue to capture market share. So, this is another box that we have checked in terms of our capabilities and we're grateful to have a partner like Shell as we navigate this and continue to develop our ESG offerings. Thanks for the question sure. We're -- again we're very optimistic. And this all contributes to our goals of increasing the contractual coverage. And we will not waver on our investment commitments which require roughly, we talk about this 1.7 million tons that's total tonnage over time. As Jack said, this is a $10-plus million ton project, plus the volume we have in the portfolio. Per annum, right? So you're talking about kind of an order of magnitude more commercialization that's required, but we feel very good about what we're seeing today and for the coming quarters. Thanks. Yes. Thanks, Christine. That's absolutely fair. It is a -- the market continues to contract for term. We've always been in the camp that long-term contracts are a key building block to this market, as it continues to grow and develop. And as we talked with Seer, it is a period -- we've gone through a period where oil indexation was more attractive to buyers than NYMEX. Now we're entering a period where we firmly believe the opposite will be true. We are quite optimistic on the Chinese market for gas and for LNG. We think this is a critical component of its economic and environmental objectives. 14th five-year plan continues to commit to that President Xi has committed to limit and actually decrease the amount of coal generation in subsequent five-year plans, which all bodes quite well for us. We're very proud of what we have done to date. We have a great commercial engagement with our Chinese counterparties, the SOEs and the Tier 2 and Tier 3 players and we fully expect to have more commercial success there. It is a very large and important market. As Jack has said in previous calls, it can double the size of Cheniere in and of itself. And we continue to be quite engaged there. But I will tell you one of the reasons we highlighted on this call non-China Asian markets is because there's there is a broad range of opportunities beyond China as well. So just like on capital allocation it will be all of the above. And again, we're entering now what we see as a multiyear period where NYMEX based contracting long-term contracting will be very attractive. Thanks Jean Ann. It's Anatol. Every supply stack that, we've ever put together has our friends at on the far left. And there's no question that, that thing gets dispatched and gets built, but its 32 million tons, right? And as we've mentioned and Jack just mentioned, this market, when it was a smaller market grew at 30-plus million tons per year. So if you \u2013 as we look at that supply curve, and we've talked about this over the last year and half, there were a lot of things in that \u2013 we thought even a year ago were a foregone conclusion that now may not even materialize this year. The QP North field expansion, of course has been FID and we're always fully expecting that it will get placed into the market. It will be done on an oil index basis most likely. And it's one of our two main competitors that we see kind of as a foregone conclusion being in the market. So we're not afraid of that. We're part of the sort of diversification of supply and contracting structure along with QP and our friends at Novatek. Thanks, Jean Ann. This is Anatol. We are not disclosing that. Again, we partnered with Shell on that, and Shell has the lead in using its methodology as we continue to develop our LCA and get that completely buttoned up pure reviewed et cetera. But those commercial terms and economics we are not disclosing. And Jack, you covered everything. It's just another product in our portfolio one that we we're not offering in and of itself as recently as a year ago. We did do midterm contracts that were effectively stapled to long-term, but it is something that as Jack said helps us engage and broadens our commercial offering. And again, fully expect that long-term contracting will resume in short order given the current margin environment and where we are in the cycle. No. Thanks Jack. Thanks Chris. This is Anatol. This is again continued progress by the team, the work that we have done over the last couple of years made us very comfortable with our environmental footprint and emissions footprint. And we are working on again quantifying, validating and having that properly assessed before we roll it out as you know in 2022, we are confident that we are part of the solution for decades to come. We just have to deliver on that transparency and that is something that we're working on. Obviously, the engagement with Shell, demonstrates steps in that direction as well. It is part and parcel of our commercial discussions and that we are -- we fully expect it to be an increasingly important component of those discussions. So, again dealt a very good hand that will continue to improve over time and contribute solutions as our customers move forward. Thanks, Sean. If I may redirect a little bit, what I think, we're discussing is, if we were in a world where natural gas prices, global natural gas prices spiked to such elevated levels, it could create long-term headwinds to natural gas' market share in the primary energy mix. What we've always said is that, that disruption that played out in the short-term spot market was a great advertisement if you will for long term contracting, right? Our customers enjoyed almost perfect reliability and almost perfect price stability over that period. And what's being highlighted now, as prices and margins have normalized is that, again, the attractiveness of a $3 minus-ish NYMEX product, plus our economics on the long-term side are very stable and very attractive and we think a key part of a diversified and flexible portfolio. So if anything just like some other price excursions that we've seen over the last couple of years, it continues to highlight the attractiveness of our turb commercial offering. And we're very well positioned for these coming years? Sean, did I lose you? Yes. Just to follow-up on Jack's points. We have very good engagement across the world on these issues and metrics. Europe has the most liquid and most transparent carbon emissions market. As you pointed out, it's trading around $60 a ton today. That is a very good sign of the benefits that the natural gas and to the extent that we're comfortable with our LCA and our emissions footprint. Cheniere's LNG is the value that can contribute to that market. But also good engagement really all over Asia as the world continues to focus and we continue to focus on improving our value chain and life cycle emissions profile that we're quite optimistic about. So kind of again, just like capital allocation all of the above."

            "name": "Jack Fusco",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today and thank you for your continued support of Cheniere. I'm pleased to be here this morning to review our outstanding results from the first quarter. Before covering our results and outlook, I want to spend a minute addressing winter storm Uri and its impact on Cheniere. As we described back in February, we were impacted by the widespread power outages in Texas, which resulted in our Corpus Christi facility being down for a few days. I'm extremely proud of our operating personnel at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi for rising to yet another weather challenge and working so diligently to manage our operations smoothly throughout the freeze event. From hurricanes the fog, to now historic freezes, the Cheniere platform has withstood whatever Mother Nature throws our way and our focus on safe and reliable operations continues to benefit our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders. As a result of the winter storm, there was no material impact on our assets or operations and we were able to fill some cargoes at Sabine Pass and restore Corpus Christi to normal operating levels quickly, to mitigate impacts on our delivery obligations. We did recognize a financial benefit as a result of some optimization activity in the period leading up to the storm. But the magnitude of that benefit is not material to our expected full year 2021 financial results. More importantly, the global LNG market has recovered significantly for 2021 and beyond, as demand has outstripped supply, resulting in higher prices, even during the shoulder and summer months. I continue to believe in the long-term viability and sustainability of LNG as an essential fuel source in the low-carbon future. Please turn to slide five, where I will review some key operational and financial highlights from the first quarter, including our upwardly revised 2021 guidance. After delivering on our 2020 guidance, despite a myriad of challenges, we continued our momentum into the first quarter and are off to a fast start. Now, full year 2021, is looking even better for us, than it did on our last call in February. For the first quarter, we generated approximately $1.5 billion of consolidated adjusted EBITDA, approximately $750 million of distributable cash flow and almost $400 million in net income on revenue of approximately $3.1 billion. We've often described 2021 as Cheniere's cash flow inflection point and you can see progress on that early in the year in our first quarter financial results. Zach will cover these numbers in more detail in a few minutes. During the first quarter, we exported a quarterly record of 133 cargoes of LNG from our two facilities, with production incentivized by strong global LNG margins during the quarter and we had the benefit of Corpus Christi Train 3 commissioning volumes. This record production is also despite Corpus, being down a few days, as a result of the winter storm in February. A sustained stronger LNG margin environment, together with our results for the first quarter, contribute to our ability to raise our full year 2021 financial guidance for the second consecutive quarter. Our outlook for the balance of the year has improved since our last call in February, with a slightly higher production forecast, augmenting the impact of the improved LNG margins, we see throughout the balance of the year. We now forecast consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $4.3 billion to $4.6 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion for the full year 2021. Near the end of the quarter, Train 3 at Corpus Christi achieved substantial completion within budget and in line with the accelerated time line, we've previously communicated. With the completion of Train 3, the Cheniere and Bechtel relationship has now delivered eight LNG trains ahead of schedule and within project budgets, which is truly world class execution. And that execution excellence continues with our ninth train. As construction on Train 6, at Sabine Pass, continues to progress against accelerated schedules. The estimated substantial completion time line has accelerated once again. Substantial completion is now projected to be achieved in the first half of next year. As I hope, you all saw this morning; we issued a press release, announcing we supplied a carbon-neutral LNG cargo to Shell, whereby Cheniere and Shell jointly offset the full life cycle emissions of a cargo. The carbon offsets covered full life cycle emissions from the wellhead, through consumption, with Cheniere delivering the cargo to Shell FOB at Sabine Pass and Shell delivering the cargo to a European regasification facility. This first carbon neutral cargo is another step in Cheniere's environmental efforts I've discussed over the past several months. Our efforts emphasize enhanced transparency, as a critical step towards improving environmental performance and maximizing the benefits of our LNG, for Cheniere, our customers and our value chain partners. Today's carbon neutral cargo announcement, follows our February announcement of cargo emissions tags development. The response to our CE tax from current and prospective customers has been extremely positive and has spurred further engagement. Our focus is to ensure the long-term benefits of natural gas as an affordable, reliable and clean energy source for the world. Turn now to slide 6, where I'll discuss what I'm seeing in the market today and why I'm so optimistic about Cheniere's future prospects. In the short-term market, we're beginning to see the impact of the structural shift to natural gas as a primary energy source for the world as evidenced by the global LNG demand growth we saw in 2020 despite the pandemic. There was constructive LNG demand tension between Europe and Asia earlier this year that left some countries short of natural gas. In addition, South America is entering its winter demand month and is contributing to the tightness in the global LNG market. With natural gas storage below normal levels in Europe and precious little new supply entering the market this year, we also have a constructive backdrop in the LNG market for the balance of this year and into next year in 2023. With Corpus Christi Train 3 completed very early and the completion time line for Sabine Pass Train 6 recently accelerated again to the first half of next year. We are ideally positioned to benefit from these near-term market dynamics. In the longer term, the supply and demand fundamentals in the global LNG market are even stronger and reinforce our confidence in the value of our existing platform and in our ability to commercialize our Corpus Christi Stage III expansion project. In the four-year period from 2017 to 2020, the global LNG market added almost 120 million tons of capacity, an average of almost 30 million tons per year. In the subsequent four-year period that average is expected to drop to approximately 11 million tons a year, a significant slowdown in supply growth, which will be amplified by output declines from older legacy projects. On the demand side, the structural shift to gas on a global basis is evidenced by the near-term doubling of LNG importing nations in the last 10 years and hundreds of billions of dollars of natural gas oriented infrastructure being built around the world today. LNG consumers recognize and value LNG's flexibility, reliability, affordability and the critical role natural gas plays in improving environmental performance and achieving decarbonization goals. We forecast that global LNG trade will approximately double expanding by approximately 350 million tons per annum to over 700 million tons per annum by 2040, which would support additional approximately 225 million tons per annum of incremental global supply. Our constructive long-term view on the LNG market was recently reinforced for the results of a comprehensive climate scenario analysis we conducted with a leading global management consulting firm. We published this analysis last month and it's available on our website. This study analyzed Cheniere's business over the long-term under various energy transition scenarios and concluded that even under the most aggressive energy transition scenario analyzed, demand for LNG and natural gas is expected to grow for decades to come. In that not only are Cheniere's existing assets well-positioned to take advantage of that, but new LNG capacity will be needed to meet that demand. With regard to Cheniere specifically, our accomplishments and progress over the past five years of LNG operations have been nothing short of transformative and position the company to take full advantage of the constructive market, we see in front of us. We have established ourselves as a premier LNG operator, demonstrating LNG buyers worldwide the reliability and certainty associated with a long-term supply agreement with Cheniere. In addition, our continuous improvement efforts have yielded efficiency gains and debottlenecking has unlocked a significant amount of extremely cost-effective volume across our projects, which further improves our competitive position and increases financial returns. As construction ramps down, the long-awaited financial results of our multiyear capital programs are bearing fruit as evidenced by today's results. This year, we expect to generate well over $1 billion of free cash flow, and we are quickly approaching our expected run rate metrics. Our run rate forecast of $11 per share, and distributable cash flow not only has a high degree of visibility, but also empowers us to execute on an all of the above strategy for capital allocation, which includes achieving investment-grade credit metrics, funding a significant portion of Corpus Christi Stage 3 with cash flow after that project is commercialized, and returning significant capital to shareholders, via buybacks and dividend. Zach and his team, and I are working diligently with the Board and the rest of management on our detailed capital allocation plans, which we will communicate to you later this year. I'm excited about what we are seeing in the LNG market, how Cheniere is positioned to capitalize with our portfolio volumes, a shovel-ready brownfield expansion project, commercial offerings tailored to customers' needs, and an improving credit and cash flow profile. With that, I'll turn the call over to Anatol, who will provide some more details on recent LNG market developments. Good morning, Jeremy. So Jeremy, this is Jack. I'll start, and then I'll turn it over to Anatol, and then Zach maybe. But we'll start off with -- first, like I'm extremely pleased with my operating staff and their ability to debottleneck and optimize our maintenance program. So during the freeze at Corpus, we were actually able to do quite a bit of maintenance on the facility. So, when we came back, we came back strong and we revised our production forecast and we found significant number of additional cargoes that we can monetize this year. And that's my expectation with the staff and the team is continuing to work on operating efficiency and our effectiveness and drive our production appropriately with market conditions. Anatol, Jeremy's question was around the market for, I guess, mid and long-term contracting. Yes. Well, Jeremy thanks. And as I'll add is I was very pleased to work with Shell one of our largest foundation customers on that first carbon neutral cargo. And I think it's successful execution just ensures that Cheniere's capabilities ensures our capabilities to actually operate across the entire value chain. I think offering climate solutions to our customers is going to be a bigger and bigger portion of our business and right in line with what our value proposition is for the customer. As I've talked about before in the past our first goal though is to monitor validate and report on our carbon footprint. And that's when we announced our cargo emission tags or the CE tags. We're well on our way on that aspect of it. You mentioned CCS. CCS is important our initial blush is that it looks very promising at our facilities. I think we're committed and have committed some real dollars to development and engineering resource. To flush out CCs and its potential capability to help us both at Sabine and at Corpus Christi. But I think our customers are going to expect us to continue to offer a sustainable LNG product. Anatol do you have anything to add? Thanks Jeremy. So, just to be clear we are 100% focused on making sure that Stage 3 gets commercialized as soon as possible. But as I talked about, on previous calls, I mean, we literally have a virtual train of LNG that we need to sell and secure, which is what our mid-term product offering is helping us do. So through our de-bottlenecking efforts and maintenance optimization there was at least 7 million tons of LNG additional LNG coming off the portfolio, that we're blessed to have, quite honestly. So that's first and foremost, is making sure that we secure the existing nine trains worth of LNG, before we go off and build Stage 3 another 11 million tons. But I don't know, Anatol or Zach do you have anything to add? Christine, it's good to hear from you. I'll start. And I'll turn it over to Zach. I am concerned about the lack of float that we've had in the stock lately. I mean, I think it's consistent with some of the oil and gas industry, overall, but I'd like to see the float get up a little bit more. I think larger investors, especially, index funds, at least in my experience, like to be able to get into stock and then get out of the stock without having too much pain. And so, we need to work on expanding our horizon and being more desirable for the investment community at large. And I think, a big portion of that is what Zach has highlighted is, getting our credit metrics under control. We don't screen very well on a Bloomberg screen. And we need to rectify that. We think we -- we're at an inflection point where we're going to have an opportunity here to give our shareholders back their investment. And we need to be thoughtful about it, which is why we're spending a lot of time trying to make sure that we get this capital allocation program done right the first time. Hi, Michael, it's Jack. And thanks for the kind words. Sabine Pass, which is what you would expect Train 6 is actually our Train number 9 with Bechtel. And I'd like to say we have figured out how to stick build these trains faster and better than probably anywhere else in the world. And it is way ahead of accelerated schedule probably close to a year ahead. So I would expect that barring decent weather because we are about ready to head into the hurricane season again, which seems almost never-ending anymore. But baring decent weather that we'll be producing LNG and commissioning on that train before the end of the year. And so we're hopeful that we can exceed the first half of the year guidance that we've given. And by November when we talk about 2022 guidance, we might be able to be more specific than just the first half of the year. But it's tracking in the right way right now. And in terms of cost there's $600 million to $700 million remaining of unlevered costs there before contingency and a large majority of that is this year. So things are really ramping up there. Not necessarily, Michael. For me it's more about the team. We got a great team at Cheniere, Bechtel has a great team supporting us right now. If there's that much of a delay, I'm sure those folks will get assigned elsewhere around the world. They're an international EPC contractor and they're not going to keep their people waiting. So for me it's more about the team and less about mobilization and demobilization costs because those are quite frankly, kind of, immaterial to the total investment. And I would just add that, we're partnering with Bechtel, as we speak actively looking at ways to make it cheaper and cheaper, and more cost competitive. So they'll be around. Absolutely. That's the beauty of some of these midterm deals. It just gives us even more clarity on how much cash is available for the company to support capital allocation efforts as we give you guys an update later this year. Thanks, Michael. Anatol? And Jean Ann, I would say that, Zach mentioned, we're working very closely with Bechtel to ensure that our expansion at Corpus Christi is the most competitive economic Henry Hub indexed expansion in the US. Thank you. Michael, midterm contracts have been around in this market forever. So we're not the first and only LNG provider to offer midterm contracts, but it's a great way for us to meet with some of increase our customer base and meet what their objectives are which -- and quite honestly compete with the Qataris or the Russians and -- or the French Total and offering these shorter term midterm contracts. So we found a pretty good appetite of customers. They are not traditionally I would say the customers the utility customers that we see on the long-term side. But there's a good market for that and that helps us manage some of these excess volumes from our production. Anatol? Absolutely Corpus Christi Stage 3 could be 11 million-ton project. And that's currently as we continue to work on value engineering with Bechtel. We continue to drive not only the production of those trains, but also drive the cost down. Greg. And then I'm sorry I missed the last half. Yeah. So we've the debottlenecking effort has went well above at least my expectations the team has just done a great job at I'd say picking the low-hanging fruit, but they -- and they continue to identify different choke points within the LNG liquefaction process that we can make modifications to continue to drive more output through it. So I do think there's more to come. We'll be giving you some guidance on that as we identify and feel comfortable that we can deliver it over the long-term. No. Look I only know about the Mozambique delay with what I read as well as what you read that from Total and Exxon. And it's a sad situation and I hope everybody is safe and healthy that were there to experience at unrest. But, no, I don't think it's -- I don't -- again it's a different business paradigm than what we offer. So we offer a full value product. The customer doesn't have to invest in equity. Customer doesn't have to worry about the E&P side of the business, because we've been able to buy at our peak almost 7Bs a day of U.S. nat gas from almost 100 different producers on 26 different pipelines and deliver it to our two facilities. So we take care of a lot of what the customer needs unlike them having to invest equity or be intimately involved in the E&P side of the business. But Anatol do you have anything to add on Mozambique? Absolutely. Most customers are interested in the diversity of supply and having a reliable supply of LNG and that's what we offer, but absolutely yeah. Thank you. We're going to -- hey Sean, we're over on our time. So I'm going to go and we still have people in the queue. So, I'm going to ask that everyone left just one question please. Thank you. Yes. Alex, I would say, first and foremost, in Brussels or in Europe is the US gas market is the most transparent market in the world. So the first thing we need to do is get our LCA done, get it published, get it reviewed by all the scientists of how we're going to calculate the life cycle emissions of the whole LNG train, because there's a lot of disinformation out there. And there is not a very good process for defining terms that everyone agrees to. So when we talk about transparency about monitoring, validating and reporting our carbon footprint that's in direct response to a lot of misinformation and miscalculation to say the least. And then secondly, I do think there's going to be a premium to carbon offsets and our ability to generate and produce carbon offset to help our customers, and those offsets need to be with their appropriate registrar. They need to be validated. I think it's all in line with what our offerings are for our customer and part of our business line and business proposition. But and I -- yes, I think the first go around will be European or a European customer is initially, but I think worldwide the whole industry will move this way. Go ahead Anatol."

            "name": "Zach Davis",
            "content": "Thanks Anatol, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our first quarter financial results and key financial updates, as well as our increased 2021 guidance. Turning to slide 12. For the first quarter, we generated net income of $393 million, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.5 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $750 million. Our financial results for the first quarter were positively impacted by increased global LNG prices and margins, particularly margins realized on spot and short-term cargoes sold through our marketing affiliate and a higher than normal contribution from LNG and natural gas portfolio optimization activities due to significant volatility in LNG and natural gas markets during the quarter.  As we have discussed in prior quarters, our IPM agreements, certain gas supply agreements and certain forward sales of LNG qualify as derivatives and require mark-to-market accounting, meaning that from period to period, we will experience non-cash gains and losses as movements occur in the underlying forward commodity curves. The impact of shifts in these curves on the fair value of our commodity and FX derivatives during first quarter 2021 was a net loss of approximately $120 million, which was substantially all non-cash.  For the first quarter, we recognized an income 456 TBtu of physical LNG, including 442 TBtu from our projects and 14 TBtu from third parties. 84% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SPA or IPM agreements. During and after this winter storm, we were able to work with our long-term customers on cargo schedules as well as shift some volumes from Corpus to Sabine, leading to no material impact to our production for the quarter.  We received no cargo cancellation notices and had no revenue related to cargo cancellations in the first quarter. However, we previously recognized $38 million of revenues during fourth quarter 2020 related to canceled cargoes that would have been lifted in the first quarter.  Commission activities for Corpus Train 3 went well as Jack discussed and we received $191 million related to sales of commissioning cargoes in the first quarter, corresponding to 25 TBtu of LNG. As a reminder, amounts received from the sale of commissioning cargoes are offset against LNG, terminal, construction and process, net of the costs associated with production and delivery of those cargoes. 6 TBtu of LNG-related to commissioning activities was on the water at the end of the first quarter and will be recorded as an offset to construction in process upon delivery.  Turning to the balance sheet. We prioritized debt reduction since raising this near-term loan to refinance convertible notes last year and have committed to pay down at least another $500 million of outstanding debt in 2021. We made good progress toward that goal during the first quarter when we paid down $148 million in outstanding borrowings under the Cheniere term loan.  I'll provide some additional color in a few moments. But we are in an excellent position to reach and likely surpass our minimum debt reduction target this year. In February, we locked in an approximately $150 million private placement of long-term amortizing fixed rate notes at SPL, that are committed to fund in late 2021 at a rate of 2.95%, the lowest yielding bond ever secured across the Cheniere complex.  In March, CQP opportunistically issued $1.5 billion of 4% senior notes through 2031, the proceeds of which together with cash on hand were used to extend the maturity and accretively refinance all of CQP's 5.25% senior notes due 2025. Our efforts on execution, performance and prudently managing the balance sheet throughout the Cheniere structure continue to be recognized by the credit rating agencies.  As we mentioned on our last call, in February, Fitch revised the outlook of SPL's senior secured notes rating to positive from stable while reaffirming its existing BBB minus investment-grade rating.  In April, S&P revised the outlook of both Cheniere Engineered Partners BB ratings to positive from negative, a signal that ratings upgrades may be coming. In addition, S&P's commentary indicated a leverage level of 4.5 to five times on a debt-to-EBITDA basis in the next couple of years could be consistent with an investment-grade rating, commentary which is in line with and supportive of our deleveraging plan and goal of investment-grade credit metrics throughout the structure. Turning now to Slide 13. As Jack mentioned, today we are again increasing our guidance ranges for full year 2021 consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow by $200 million, bringing total increases to $400 million above the original ranges we provided in November of last year. Our revised guidance ranges are $4.3 billion to $4.6 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion in distributable cash flow. Today's increase in guidance is largely driven by our strong results in the first quarter, the continued improvement in global LNG market pricing and our ability to execute additional higher-margin forward sales into the stronger pricing. Since the last call, we have continued to lock in additional volumes for the remainder of the year. Though those sales have been offset by an upwardly revised production forecast, driven by maintenance optimization, some favorable weather, and a much faster than expected ramp-up to steady Train 3 volumes. We currently forecast that a $1 change in market margin would impact EBITDA by approximately $40 million for full year 2021. As we have now sold almost all of our production for the remainder of the year and have completed and placed Corpus Stage 3 into service in line with our previously forecasted timing. Our remaining exposure this year is not material and we only plan to provide another update, if that were to change. We are confident in our ability to deliver results within these upwardly revised guidance ranges for the full year. With Train 3 now in operation, we've also now passed the free cash flow inflection point, we have long discussed with our stakeholders. We expect to generate meaningful free cash flow this year for the first time in Cheniere's history of well over $1 billion. We originally committed to $500 million in debt reduction this year but we now think $500 million is conservative due to our strong performance and cash flow generation year-to-date and the forward sales of LNG, we have executed in a strong LNG market. We are continuing to work on our long-term capital allocation strategy with our Board and we anticipate communicating this multiyear plan to you in the second half of the year, including more comprehensive plans for the remainder of free cash flow this year after meeting our initial 2021 debt reduction goal of $500 million. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions. Sure. Thanks, Anatol, and hey, Jeremy. Today, we obviously aren't going to give you a look at our open capacity for 2022 yet. Really we have to get through that budget process. We have the annual delivery program or ADP process. And by November, we'll give you our best outlook for 2022 and the open position and probably have even a better sense of when trains fixed, is coming online. But you can expect we're already proactively thinking about it and executing on 2022 and the attractive margins now in the curve over the next few years. And with the success that CMI has had on terming out physically, including through mid-term deals, some of our debottleneck capacity. This has really helped lock in fixed fees this year for the next few years actually. And post-2021, we've already secured over let's say over $500 million and in just in 2022 over $200 million. So, you can say we've already been pretty proactive in locking up a portion of that open capacity for next year. Hey, no problem. This is Zach here. And I think the S&P note last month for the outlook upgrade at CEI and CQP this really validates everything we've been communicating to you all for the last few years on capital allocation. And it's pretty consistent with how we step-by-step got our -- even our project ratings over time from high-yield to investment grade. That's the being in Corpus by every agency. And now looking ahead, there's a, I guess a defined path of EBITDA growth plus debt paydown to get below six times consolidated leverage to get to BB+ in the next year or so. And then leverage down to sub five times to get to BBB in the next few years. So our path is pretty straightforward to get to IG with S&P, as metrics improve and as we simply grow into our run-rate and follow through with capital allocation and debt paydown of up to $4 billion pretty much consistent with what we've told you. So that's the plan and that's on a consolidated debt-to-EBITDA basis. And I'll just add to what Jack said, Christine. And I think it's pretty obvious, if we can get to investment-grade in the next couple of years, or even just get into the S&P 500 index it'd be helpful to bring more and more new investors into the stock. And I think it's pretty safe to say, we're on track for both of those with a bit more time. And it's probably time. That's the operative word for this company, because every day that goes by, we'll be making progress on our leverage get closer and closer to our run rate cash flows. And $11 is just going to be too hard to ignore. Especially, as that goes with capital allocation and growth. The other thing I'd note -- Christine, I'll just add one thing to that, is that it's more than fair to say that over time we're interested in attracting more and more income investors to the stock as well. But we know our leverage goes hand-in-hand with that, to ensure that any shareholder return really is just sustainable, not just for a few years but for decades. So I think the all-of-the-above type strategy to capital allocation, like Jack mentioned in the prepared remarks, is exactly what we're going to try to bring to you all in the next year or so. Sure. I think many folks smooth out our quarters over the course of the year and maybe that underestimated what many of you thought we would produce for Q1. But Q1, Q4 often the colder quarters of the year. They're not shoulder season. So there's less demand for LNG as well, and there's more volatility at the same time. All of that adds to higher EBITDA higher figures for the beginning and the end of the year. So this was as expected to us, and we've made it pretty simple that for the rest of the year there's only about 40 TBtu even open. When those cargoes are delivered, that depends on some of the FOB versus Des deals that we have. But this is right on track for where we thought we would be for Q1 with some additional optimization of higher LNG margins, and then for the rest of the year.  Q - Ben Nolan All right. Okay. Thanks. Sure. This is Zach. And as you mentioned, we were able to raise guidance last time in February by $200 million. Our 200 TBtu of open capacity went down to 50 TBtu. And as the market went up, we were able to take advantage of that. Since that call, the rest of the year had been looking around $2. That's going up another dollar. And at the same time, our operations folks have been pretty opportunistic on the production. Just with the colder weather Train 3 actually ramping up pretty smoothly after March 26th and then just some opportunistic maintenance during the freeze and fog. That they added around 10 more cargoes to the forecast, that's over 30 TBtu. So when you add those two things together that gets to your $200 million pretty much. Not really, considering I just gave you a number that's maybe three, four if not more of a 200 move."

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Randy Bhatia. Please go ahead.\nRandy Bhatia: Thank you. Operator. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to Cheniere's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. The slide presentation and access to the webcast for today's call are available at cheniere.com. Joining me this morning are Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO; Anatol Feygin, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Zach Davis, Executive Vice President and CFO, another members of the Cheniere management team. Before we begin, I'd like to remind all listeners that our remarks, including answers to your questions, may contain forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from what is described in these statements. Slide 2 of our presentation contains a discussion of those forward-looking statements and associated risks. In addition, we may include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the appendix to the slide presentation. As part of our discussion of Cheniere's results, today's call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP, or CQP. We do not intend to cover CQP's results separately from those of Cheniere Energy, Inc. The call agenda is shown on Slide 3. Jack will begin with operating and financial highlights, Anatol will then provide an update on the LNG market, and Zach will review our financial results and 2023 guidance. After prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO.\nJack Fusco: Thank you, Randy. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning ad we will review an incredibly rewarding and transformational 2022 and provide our outlook for what we expect to be another very busy and successful year for Cheniere in 2023. To say 2022 was an incredible year for Cheniere would be an understatement. Disruption and volatility dominated energy markets the world over as geopolitical tension and the weaponization of energy supply turbocharged already volatile markets suffering from years of underinvestment in infrastructure. The criticality of reliable natural gas supply in a normally functioning energy system and the vital role natural gas plays throughout a developed economy was put on full display as the world watched some of the wealthiest nations in the developed world scramble to ensure reliable energy supply for their populations and economies. And while it appears now that a severe energy crisis in Europe over the winter has been narrowly avoided, the situation there only further reinforces the vital need for a reliable, affordable, secure and diverse energy mix. At Cheniere, we were proud to play an important role in helping balance global energy markets at a time when it was needed most. With the early completion and advanced startup of Train 6 at Sabine Pass, as well as optimizing our maintenance schedule, we produced approximately 44 million tons of LNG during 2022, 72% of which was directed to Europe, further illustrating the value of destination flexibility which Cheniere pioneered. And of course, over the summer we reached FID on Corpus Christi Stage 3, which will bring an additional 10 million tons of much needed LNG to the global market and our long term customers beginning in 2025. Over the course of 2022, the focus of the global natural gas industry for both suppliers and consumers, crystallized for the trilemma of energy security, affordability, and long term environmental performance. On each of these critical points, Cheniere offers a market leading solution which instills my confidence in our growth potential, which I'll speak to in a few minutes. Please turn to slide 5 where I will review key operational and financial highlights from the fourth quarter and full year 2022 and introduce our 2023 financial guidance. We generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year total to approximately $11.6 billion above the high end of our guidance range. We generated approximately $2.3 billion of distributable cash flow in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year 2022 DCF total to approximately $8.7 billion, also above the high end of our guidance range. Looking back at the original guidance provided in November of 2021, we beat the midpoint of each of those guidance ranges by over $5 billion, illustrating the extraordinary nature of the global gas markets and the value of our ability to be a reliable operator and supplier during the year. For the fourth quarter, we generated over $3.9 billion of net income, and our annual total is a positive $1.4 billion. Our net income continues to be impacted by noncash unrealized derivatives, which worked in our favor in the fourth quarter as global gas markets moderated. During the fourth quarter, Zach and his team made excellent progress on our capital allocation plan, deploying billions of dollars into capital return via debt repayment, share repurchases, and increased dividends as well into disciplined accretive growth at Corpus Christi Stage 3. He's sitting here next to me, anxious to cover capital allocation in more detail, so I'll stop there before stealing too much of his thunder. Operationally, the fourth quarter and full year 2022 were exceptional. Fortifying Cheniere status as a leading global operator, reliably producing LNG with safety at the foundation of every action we take. During the quarter, we exported a record 166 cargoes from our facilities, bringing our annual total to a record of 638 cargoes. I'd like to recognize Cheniere\u2019s approximately 1,550 professionals who worked tirelessly in 2022 for demonstrating Cheniere\u2019s execution and operations leadership to the global marketplace and helping enable the outstanding results we reported this morning, all while achieving record safety metrics throughout the year. Now, shifting our focus to 2023, I'm pleased to introduce our 2023 financial guidance of $8 billion to $8.5 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA, $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion in distributable cash flow and $4 to $4.25 in per unit distributions of CQP. I am pleased to provide 2023 guidance figures that are significantly higher than our more normalized 9 Train run rate, and I believe that the stabilization of both prices and volatility in the international gas markets will support stronger and faster demand growth, ultimately, this should support my long-term health conviction and the structural shift to natural gas worldwide. Turn out to slide 6, where I'll cover my key priorities for 2023. First and foremost, we have an established track record earned over multiple years of delivering on our promises, and I expect that to be maintained in 2023. We have set ambitious but achievable guidance ranges for the year, and our focus will be on strengthening that track record by delivering on our financial guidance. In 2023, with less CMI volume and without the variable of new capacity entering service, we have a higher degree of visibility on our metrics than we did a year ago to hit our forecasted production estimates and continue to progress on our 2020 vision capital allocation plan. Second, we expect to lead with organic growth and have over 30 million tons currently under development or under construction. Our 40 plus billion in infrastructure investments is one of the biggest competitive advantages we have, as it enables economically advantaged capacity expansions such as Corpus Christi Stage 3. Construction activities at Stage 3 is progressing. And while it's too early to say we are ahead of schedule, since we are about 2% complete on construction, Bechtel was beginning to execute on some aspects of early construction ahead of plan. On the growth front beyond Stage 3, we are progressing through the prefiling process on midscale Trains 8, 9 at Corpus Christi, and we expect to submit the full filing to FERC before the end of the first quarter. Over at Sabine Pass, I hope you saw our announcement this morning that we have just initiated the permitting process for a significant capacity expansion there by submitting pre filing documentation to FERC. I'll discuss this project in more detail on the next slide, but we are extremely excited about developing this expansion of Sabine Pass, which could add approximately 20 million tons of additional capacity at the site. Moving this project through the engineering and construction and permitting process will be a major priority in 2023. Anatol, Ramzi and the team are actively commercializing this new potential investment. Third, we'll further advance our climate and sustainability initiatives, which we'd like to describe as actionable, not aspirational. Despite the industrywide focus on energy security in 2022, improving environmental performance remains a long-term goal and establishing and maintaining environmental competitiveness is critical for continued natural gas adoption and therefore the long-term resiliency of LNG. The programs we have discussed on recent calls such as our QMRV program, our cargo emission tags, and joining the UN's oil and Gas Methane Partnership are all efforts on which I expect continuous focus, improvement and refinement to further reinforce genre's leadership position on these crucial efforts. Now turn to slide 7 where I'll share some details about our next major capacity expansion at Sabine Pass. We've just commenced the permitting process on this large scale project by submitting the prefiling documentation to FERC. We expect to submit the full filing before the end of the year and look forward to working with FERC on permitting this major brownfield capacity expansion. The Sabine Pass expansion project is being designed for approximately 20 million tons of LNG. The project is expected to consist of up to three large scale Liquefaction trains utilizing the same Liquefaction process technology that's deployed on the six operating trains at SPL. Each train is expected to have a nominal production capacity of approximately 6.5 million tons. The project is also expected to include a Boil-Off Gas Re-Liquefaction Unit which would add almost a million tons of production, and two full containment LNG storage tanks. You can see the rendering of the project on the slide. We have been hard at work on early stage development of this project and have Bechtel already engaged on front end engineering and design work and are excited about transforming the engineering drawing on the slide into reality at Sabine Pass. We will develop the Sabine Pass expansion project utilizing the same rigorous and financially disciplined approach to project development and capital investment you've become accustomed to from Cheniere. The SPL expansion project is consistent with the significant growth plans we laid out in our capital allocation presentation in September. We showed a potential 90 million ton platform across the Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi. Our infrastructure platform is an enormous competitive advantage which this project is expected to capitalize on in order to deliver Brownfield economics. As the world calls for more LNG capacity, Cheniere is in an economically and environmentally advantaged position to provide that incremental capacity. We look forward to updating you on this large scale growth project at Sabine Pass as well as the developments at Corpus as we move through this process. Thank you again for your continued support of Cheniere. I'll now turn the call over to Anatol who will provide an update on the LNG market.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks Jack and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide 9. An accelerated post pandemic recovery followed by the curtailment of Russian gas flows into Europe made for a sharp increase in LNG demand in 2022, with limited new liquefaction capacity and several production outages, the LNG market remained extremely tight throughout the year as we saw prices reach all-time highs and remain elevated. Despite the supply side challenges, global LNG trade grew by approximately 5% from 2021, or an additional approximately 19 million tons. Overall, US exports increased 9% year-on-year, up 6.3 million tons to 76.5 Mtpa in 2022 despite the freeport outage during the second half of the year. US LNG represented nearly 40% of the growth in global LNG supply, and the early completion of our 9 Train meaningfully contributed to that growth. As Zack noted, our increase in production enabled Cheniere to help answer Europe's call for reliable, flexible natural gas supply. Having lost Russia as a significant supplier, Europe became a substantial demand center for LNG, attracting approximately 70% of all US LNG in 2022 as prices reached record levels and redirected destination flexible US LNG volumes to address the deficit. The TTF monthly settlement prices averaged around $40 per MMBtu in 2022, over 180% higher than the $14 average in 2021. In the fourth quarter, TTF monthly settlement prices averaged $42 per MMBtu or 46% higher year-on-year, but significantly lower than the peak of nearly $100 in MMBtu in late August. Similarly, the 2022 JKM average settlement price increased by over 125% year-on-year to an average of $34 per MMBtu with the fourth quarter average price increasing 38% year-on-year to an average of $38, but well below the summer peak of nearly 70. In the US, Henry Hub price averaged nearly $7.22, but has moderated considerably since the peak in September and is now trading well below $3 per MMBtu. This rapid correction, driven by North American production growth, again demonstrates the relative attractiveness of Cheniere\u2019s Henry Hub denominated long-term FOB and DS contracts and underpins producers desire to diversify away from solely domestic indices. Despite the retreat of global gas prices to prewar levels beginning in the fourth quarter and into 2023 on the back of a mild winter and demand reduction efforts in Europe, the overall market remains volatile. And we expect volatility to remain elevated as Europe sorts out its near and long term gas supply strategies and the impact of a post COVID China on the market becomes more apparent. Let's now turn to slide 10 to address regional dynamics in some more detail. As noted, much of the flexible LNG in the market was directed to Europe and was able to offset a large part approximately 84% of the 74 Bcm, or 55 million ton reduction in Russian gas supply. Europe's LNG imports totaled over 120 million of which 110 million tons went to EU plus UK, which is a 69% increase year-on-year. US LNG to the block plus the UK totaled 48 million tons, a 165% increase year-on-year. Clearly, destination flexible US LNG was able to answer Europe's call for natural gas supply in 2022. Throughout the year, the EU implemented several extraordinary measures to mitigate the potential impact of a complete cutoff of Russian gas and a potentially cold winter amid low nuclear and hydrogeneration output. As Zack noted, the challenges that European nations faced were significant. But these measures, along with mild weather and demand price response, enabled Europe to replenish its inventories and avoid a potentially crippling energy crisis in the near term. Some of the coordinated initiatives included a regulatory push to immediately increase LNG import infrastructure, diversify supply sources and reduce natural gas demand. To date, five new regasification terminals have commenced service in Europe since September, a key enabler of Europe's ability to grow LNG imports to record levels in the fourth quarter. Demand reduction efforts have also been made across Europe. Residential, commercial and industrial customers were able to reduce aggregate demand by an estimated 12% during the year as power generation resorted to increase coal usage, a trend that we think will reverse in 2023 given elevated gas storage levels and again, a mild weather outlook. At present, it appears the European gas system will make it through this winter without the enforced supply restrictions many had feared. Amid historically high LNG prices, the global inflationary environment, lower economic activity and lower market liquidity, some of the more price sensitive Asian buyers withdrew from the spot LNG market. Imports into Asia declined by 20 million tons, or 7%, year-on-year, with nearly 16 million tons of the drop attributable to China. This was the first substantial annual decline in LNG imports since the country began importing in 2006. China's economy faced extended COVID restrictions, a property sector crisis and severe drought, all of which led to a drop in total gas demand of 4 Bcm in 2022, with a decline led by the industrial and power generation sectors. Similar to parts of Europe, low hydro output and high gas prices supported increased coal generation in the second half of 2022. However, with JKM and TTF prices moderating, we expect to see price sensitive Asian LNG demand resume on indications of higher industrial activity in China as COVID restrictions are lifted. The latter, of course, could have a potentially material impact on next winter's global balance. Let's move to slide 11. Europe shift away from Russia created an immediate supply gap of approximately 70 Bcm in 2022, which will likely rise to approximately 110 Bcm in 2023. Assuming Russian pipeline supplies are eventually fully curtailed, the gap created of 100 Mtpa is equivalent to around a quarter of the current global LNG market. The magnitude of this supply shock stressed the global LNG market in 2022, resulting in some demand destruction in certain regions during the year. More important, however, as Zack noted, the market dynamics of \u201822 highlighted the critical role of LNG in ensuring energy security, underscoring the importance of long-term contracted reliable LNG supply in the global energy mix. While short-term dynamics have dominated headlines and narratives over the last year, the long term fundamentals are central to our strategic planning and positioning, and the need for further investment in LNG capacity was again laid bare last year. Over the next few decades, both the supply and demand side are supportive of new liquefaction infrastructure. In addition to high project development hurdles, capital intensity and long construction timelines for new LNG facilities, legacy plant utilization rates worldwide continued to decline as a result of outages, feedstock limitations and fleet inefficiencies, as well as competing domestic demand in some markets. Since 2010, the volume produced from these legacy projects has declined by 23%, or over 25 million tons, further contributing to the need for more capacity. While these facilities produced about a quarter of all total volume last year, their contribution will likely decline over time as feedstock resources deplete, their ability to export declines and their performance potentially degrades. Meanwhile, investment in downstream LNG infrastructure continues to grow, not only in Europe, but also in other parts of the world. Over 370 million tons of regas capacity is under development, which is equivalent to about 80% of global LNG trade today. Furthermore, nine new markets are expected to enter the LNG trade in the next two years, including Vietnam, the Philippines, and Ghana, just to name a few. Investments in new LNG supply are critically needed not only to address the current market imbalance and meet the expected long term demand growth, but also to offset declining production from certain legacy production facilities. To this end, Cheniere is doing its part with over 10 million tons under construction and another 20 plus million tons in the permitting process we aim to leverage our many advantages to economically contribute to the overall reliability, security, affordability and scale of the global LNG market. With commercial support for capacity beyond Corpus Christi Stage 3 in hand, the team is well positioned to leverage that success as we develop and commercialize the SPL expansion project. With that, I will turn the call over to Jack to review our financial results and guidance.\nZach Davis: Thanks Anatol and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results and key financial accomplishments and 2023 financial guidance. As Zack and Anatol have noted, 2022 was quite a year for our company, our stakeholders and our industry as a whole. And the financial results we reported today once again reflect the Cheniere team's unwavering commitment to operational excellence, execution and financial discipline, which is especially important throughout this period of prolonged volatility in the global energy markets. Turning to slide 13, for the fourth quarter and full year, we generated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $3.1 billion and $11.6 billion, respectively, and distributable cash flow of approximately $2.3 billion and $8.7 billion, or approximately $35 of annual cash flow per share. With the full year results exceeding the high end of our latest guidance ranges provided in September. Thanks to these full year results ending up close to $5.5 billion higher than our original 2022 guidance. We've been able to transform our capital allocation objectives now as an investment grade company with Stage 3 construction fully underway and a sharpened focus on more robust shareholder returns in the form of our upsized $4 billion buyback program and our competitively growing dividend. During the fourth quarter and full year, we recognized an income 591 and 2,317 TBtu of physical LNG, respectively which included 581 and 2,288 TBtu from our projects and 10 and 29 TBtu sourced from third parties, respectively. Approximately 80% of these LNG volumes recognized in income in both periods were sold under long term SPA or IPM agreements with terms greater than 10 years. Our fourth quarter and full year results once again were supported by increased margins realized on our LNG delivered, which were primarily driven by the elevated market pricing throughout the year and higher volumes produced at both of our sites, thanks to the early completion and ramp up of SPL Train 6 and the maintenance optimization announced in May. Our total margins also benefited from portfolio optimization activities in addition to the proceeds from the early termination of the Chevron TUA. In addition, I would like to highlight that we generated net income of $3.9 billion and $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. As we've noted in prior earnings calls, our net income line is impacted by the unrealized noncash derivative impact, primarily related to the mismatch of accounting methodology for the purchase of natural gas and the corresponding sale of LNG under our long term IPM agreements. While this resulted in unfavorable changes throughout most of 2022 as international gas prices rose, during the fourth quarter, the moderating of international gas price curves provided a significant benefit, allowing us to hit an inflection point with cumulative positive net income for the preceding 12-months for the first time in a few years. Before discussing our financial guidance and priorities for 2023, I'd like to recap some of our key financial accomplishments for 2022 and how effective we've been in allocating the capital back into the business and to our shareholders. First and foremost, I'm pleased to highlight that our commitment to achieving and maintaining a sustainable balance sheet was recognized by the rating agencies, with 13 distinct upgrades to our credit ratings across our corporate structure over the last year, including the achievement of two investment grade ratings at each of our parent entities. solidifying Cheniere as officially investment grade. In November, S&P upgraded Cheniere and CQP by two notches to BBB, with a stable outlook marking Cheniere's first and CQP second investor grade rating not long after Fitch initiated its coverage of Cheniere with a BBB minus rating and a stable outlook. As you all know, achieving investment grade has long been a goal of ours, as we believe it best positions Cheniere for the future and validates the long-term value and sustainability of our platform. During the quarter, we prepaid approximately $2.2 billion in consolidated long-term indebtedness, bringing our total debt paydown to just over $6.6 billion through the fourth quarter since launching our original capital allocation plan in 2021, with over $5 billion of debt reduction in 2022 alone. Since our third quarter call in November, we also issued $500 million of senior secured amortizing notes due 2037 in the public and private debt capital markets, the proceeds of which were used along with cash on hand to redeem the remaining SPL 2023 notes. In December, we also repurchased over 750 million of the outstanding 2024 notes at CCH pursuant to a tender offer. And in January redeemed the remaining nearly $500 million outstanding with cash on hand. We also continued to utilize our open market repurchase program and in the fourth quarter repurchased over $400 million in principle of outstanding CCH notes with maturities ranging from 2025 to 2039. With all that said, today we have almost $10 billion of consolidated available liquidity, including our bank facilities, investment grade balance sheets throughout the Cheniere structure, and our nearest maturity is not until next year. I'm very proud of what our team has accomplished at such an accelerated pace, as each of these transactions reflects our focus on managing our debt across the corporate structure, opportunistically and strategically for the long term. As we mentioned back in November, now that we've solidified our balance sheet and reached our initial investment grade goals, we have balanced out our priorities, recalibrating our debt pay down to share repurchase ratio from four to one, to one to one as outlined in our revised capital allocation from last September. In fact, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares for over $700 million, bringing our total shares repurchased during 2022 to 9.3 million for approximately $1.4 billion. Given our one to one cumulative goal over time, you can expect that we will continue the share buyback momentum with growing relative buyback allocations for 2023. In order to achieve our cumulative one to one target ratio with debt paydown. We also paid $1.0385 per common share in dividends last year, inclusive of a 20% increase for the third quarter, and declared and paid our 6th quarterly dividend of $0.0395 for the fourth quarter this past month. We intend to follow through with our previous guidance of growing our dividend annually by approximately 10% into the mid-2020s through construction of Stage 3. Turn now to slide 14, where I will discuss our 2023 guidance and update you on our open capacity for the remainder of the year. For 2023, our guidance is $8 billion to $8.5 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $5.5 billion to $6 billion in distributable cash flow or over $20 of cash flow per share. These ranges reflect current international gas prices curves as well as our significantly smaller open position relative to 2022, given the start of several long term contracts this year and our planned maintenance at Sabine Pass. 2022 was an unprecedented year, with EBITDA and DCF approaching double and triple our respective 9 Train run rate guidance levels for those metrics. 2023 is shaping up to be another incredible year with guidance ranges multiple billions of dollars above the run rate levels for both, thanks to proactive management of our open capacity despite a higher contribution from long- term contracts in 2023. Our focus remains on achieving the 2020 vision of generating over $20 billion of cash and over $20 DCF per share, and our expectation on accomplishing that plan hasn't wavered despite the moderation in near-term prices highlighting the stability and visibility of our long-term cash flow profile. With regard to open capacity, we have less than 70 TBtu of unsold LNG remaining 20, which are reserved for long term origination, and we currently forecast that a $1 change in market margin would impact EBITDA by approximately $50 million for the balance of 2023. The marketing team has done an excellent job proactively selling our open capacity since November from 150 TBtu, which has allowed us to come out with this guidance range of over $8 billion today and keep us on track with our 2020 vision. In addition, our results could be impacted by the timing of certain year end cargoes heading into 2024. Our distributable cash flow for 2023 could also be affected by certain contemplated changes in the tax code under the IRA. However, the guidance provided today is based on the current IRA tax law guidance, in which we would not qualify for the minimum corporate tax of 15% this year. However, both of these dynamics would mainly affect timing and not materially impact our cumulative cash flow generation through the mid-2020s as we think about overall capital allocation deployment. Looking back on 2022, the year was filled with uncertainty across global energy markets, but the Cheniere team remained focused on what we could control the reliable, safe and seamless operations of Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi, which enabled us to achieve extraordinary results across our business, accelerate our follow through on our commitment to capital allocation by deploying over $8 billion towards our all the above plans, including our growth objectives with Stage 3. Our conviction and the critical long-term role of natural gas across the globe to address the trilemma of energy security, affordability and long-term environmental performance has only grown in the wake of energy market volatility last year. We are positioning Cheniere for the future in everything that we do, including our accretive growth projects, our investment grade balance sheet, and our long term commitment to generating meaningful and sustainable shareholder returns. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Reynolds with UBS.\nBrian Reynolds: Good morning, everyone and congrats on now qualifying for S&P 500 eligibility. Maybe to start off just on the macro, we see a much different headline TTF and JKM price versus our time together on the last conference call. That said, we are starting to see some green shoots on demand recovery in both Europe and Asia. And I was curious if you could broadly discuss perhaps what are you seeing in terms of near term demand coming back, supporting the spot market and then as a follow up, perhaps on a longer term basis with a more normalized headline price. Are you seeing a pickup in contracting activity from counterparties? Thanks.\nJack Fusco : Thanks Brian. I'll turn it over to Anatol. He can talk about the demand growth that we're seeing across the globe.\nAnatol Feygin: Hey, Brian. Good morning. Thanks. We've had very good engagement throughout \u201822, as you can imagine, as we've discussed in the prepared remarks and throughout the last few years, the value of that long term contract, the stability, reliability and getting these volumes at a quarter or a third of that headline price has never been clearer than it was throughout \u201822. So we're very encouraged by what we're seeing. While we obviously saw short term demand destruction, to your point, most countries remain very committed to gas, continue to invest substantially in infrastructure, whether that's China, India, other Southeast Asian markets, et cetera. Europe, of course. And we're very encouraged by a very brief mix of committed interest to our product. So feel very optimistic about the hand we're dealt and obviously very excited that now the SPL expansion is out there for us to really hit the ground running.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. Thanks. And as a follow up on just capital allocation, recent investment grade upgrades by two agencies and growth CapEx and dividends seems to be spoken for the next couple of years. Should we view Cheniere through the lines of a return of cash story via buybacks? Or are there any moving pieces that we should think about for use of excess cash flow and the excess balance sheet capacity that you have now? Thanks.\nZach Davis: Hey, this is Zach, and I think you got it right. But the over $700 million of buybacks and Q4 was the most we've ever done strategically as we were thinking about late last year and early this year. We were really just trying to take care of the ratings. And then we overloaded the debt pay down to get there once and for all with Fitch and S&P. So though the guidance is one to one, we did pay down a bit more debt in the last quarter or so. So it is time to catch up this year and going forward to get back to one to one on a cumulative basis. And as you think about how much debt paydown we did over the last year was like $5 plus billion just in 2022, there's probably about $2 billion plus buybacks on a relative basis to debt pay down that needs to happen over the next year or two. So we'll be keenly focused on that and obviously not a bad time to be buying back for at lower levels than we thought we would be at this point. And it will just help us solidify the 2020 vision that we remain on track for.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Good morning. I just want to start off here on Sabine Pass. At the risk of putting the cart ahead of the horse here, just wondering if we could get any more color about how this commercialization process could look down the road. And specifically, if you're looking for gas sourcing, would this likely come from the Permian new pipe there? We think about financing, would CQP be issuing equity? What type of timeline for contract commercialization will be thinking just any bits of information you could provide as far as thoughts on what this could look like would be super helpful.\nJack Fusco : Thanks, Jeremy. As you can tell from our prepared remarks, we are so excited about the Sabine Pass expansion. If you look at trying to see what slide number it was, Randy 7 of ours, you can see the rendition from Bechtel of what it would look like. That property is currently being utilized right now as lay down area. So it's primed and ready to go, which is one of the advantages that we have as a brownfield site. The infrastructure is there at the facility and there's a huge push and pull from the customer base worldwide. So you all remember back in 2016 when I started. We had 13 foundation customers; we now have over 33. Those are customers that take at least a cargo a month and have a tenure of over 20 years. And that customer diversity has grown dramatically as our contract structures have grown between FOB, DS, IPMS, et cetera, and who knows what's next but that Anatol and Ramzi have in their back pocket. But I will turn it over to Jack to talk about some of the more specific details.\nZach Davis: Sure. And then I'll hand it off to Anatol, can give you a little update on how he's thinking about contracting the project going forward. But basically we're just starting that permitting process and engineering work with Bechtel, and it's going to be quite some time before we spend even more than $100 million as we develop that over the coming year or so. But obviously, since it's brownfield, it should be cost advantage, but it is 20 million tons. So you can imagine we'll approach it like we've approached everything, likely even in stages, as we've done on previous projects, just to be more efficient with the bank debt, capital raises and spreading out the equity over time. But the key component for us as we think about financing it is the fact that we now have this base plus variable distribution policy at CQP. So we can go through a major expansion at Sabine, maintain the base distribution, which is over $3.10 and live within our cash flows and stick to the same amount of 50% give or take of leverage and make it work which is a pretty neat place to be. So CQP works as is, and obviously it goes without saying that we'll hold to our investment parameters, make sure that it's accretive not just on a value basis, but a credit basis, too. And have all the other bells and whistles that you're accustomed to having with us when we FID a project, Anatol?\nAnatol Feygin: Yes, just to dive in a little bit to your question, as you know, the integration of upstream infrastructure solutions and gas supply has been a key success factor of ours and be one of our main kind of structural advantages. So we take that extremely seriously and we'll have robust solutions for that. And the customer mix, the crystal ball is fairly similar to what we have experienced over the last three to four years in a very healthy, credit worthy mix that does include producer customers, which partially includes not only the liquefaction fee but also the gas supply component and the opportunities to optimize those volumes flexibly downstream. So you are going to see from the commercial side producers, you are going to see European and Asian buyers and I think everyone is excited about this opportunity to continue to serve the market with this growth.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you. And just want to kind of touch on some of the other points you listed on that slide as far as it relates to the Boil-Off Gas Re-Liquefaction Unit and accommodation for waste heat removal and CCS. Just wondering if you could talk a bit more about these projects. What type of economics to these CapEx, do these projects have? Does it compete versus the facilities themselves? And did things such as 45-Q, I guess, possibly help economics here?\nJack Fusco : Yes. Jeremy. So on the Boil-Off Gas, right now, the Boil-Off Gas is the facility gets redirected back into the trains and gets reprocessed, and that takes up space in the train. So our production numbers look the same, but our feed gas flows aren't as high as they otherwise would be. And we have run the math and figured that the Boil-Off Gas Re-Liquefaction Unit would substantially help us increase the production throughout the rest of the facility. So that's an added benefit that we don't currently have at either of the sites. And then secondly, you mentioned some of the heat recovery units. As you know, I've been in power my whole life, and I think being able to capture the hot flue gas out of the end of the gas turbines, run them, produce steam, use that to make power, just makes the whole process more efficient, makes us much more competitive overall. So we need to utilize that waste heat, and it helps with our environmental profile. So you should expect us to do what's right, and that would be utilizing that waste heat and reinjecting or sequestering the AGRU stream that comes off the gas stream efficiently.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's great to hear about further optimization and squeezing every penny out. Zack, thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from the line of Marc Solecitto with Barclays.\nMarc Solecitto: Hi, thanks. Good morning. With the formal upgrade to IG, could you talk about some of the benefits that come with that either commercially and or on the operational side with respect to either working capital management or collateral requirements related to hedges or forward sales?\nJack Fusco : Sure. So getting to IG is more than just symbolic. We actually have lower pricing now on our working capital facilities and revolvers. And both the corporate revolvers are now officially unsecured, which gives us even more flexibility going into the future. So that's all helpful. In addition to that, all the optimization that CMI does sometimes even sourcing from third parties. We're not posting nearly as much as we used to with LCS and things like that. We can just use a parent guarantee considering CMI is wholly owned by CEI. So that's pretty helpful. And then in terms of open credit, we're getting more that's a work in progress as we speak. But basically, when it comes to financial derivatives and hedging, that's still all about liquidity. Yes, we might have a little open capacity, but as we saw with the volatility this past year, that's still a liquidity thing. And what I mentioned on the call, we literally have $10 billion of total liquidity with the term loan that's available, the revolvers and the cash on hand. So we have legged in a bit on financial hedging. And that's been helpful partially to why we're down to only 50 TBtu really open going forward.\nMarc Solecitto: Great. That's helpful. And then following up on a potential expansion at SPL, how should we think about the key potential cadence there? Could you do that one train at a time? And then for the 20 million tons of expanded capacity, is there the potential for some additional debottlenecking on the existing capacity with some of the investment in the ancillary infrastructure?\nJack Fusco : My operating team never ceases to stop amazing me with what they're able to do as far as our debottlenecking and optimization efforts. So I would say yes and yes. It's our intent that we would commercialize these trains like we have in the past and, as Jack said, could potentially build them individually or in stages.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from the line of Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein.\nJean Salisbury: Hi. Good morning. Just one more follow up on the commercialization of the Sabine Pass expansion. Anatol, can you give some color on how much of a disadvantage it is to not have the FERC approval in hand when you're out trying to commercialize versus all these other approved but untested operators in the market today? Maybe it doesn't matter because Cheniere's reputation is so strong, but just wondering.\nJack Fusco : What you said, Jean Ann, so we -- very fair question. And we've thought about a lot, as you know, and we've discussed over the years what that opportunity could potentially buy us. And as you saw last year, as we were commercializing Corpus Stage 3, we ended up commercializing things that were well beyond Stage 3 and are sitting in an enviable position of having that portfolio of offtake in hand with almost 3 million tons at our option to convert to SPA. So it's great to have this maps and renderings, of course help, but as you said, that reputation and what the Cheniere platform has armed us with on the commercial side is that great track record and execution that really is unmatched in the LNG market. So it's great to have this in hand, but it is not, we don't see it as a disadvantage that don't have the full 20 million tons approved today.\nJean Salisbury: Great. Thank you. And can you kind of discuss the pros and cons that you weighed in your decision to return to full size trains for your next project rather than mid-scale?\nJack Fusco : Yes. So, Jean Ann, now we have all the tools in our toolkit. And when we looked at Sabine Pass and looked at potential different power solutions, the most economical trains there are the large scale ConocoPhillips trains versus the smaller midscale units. And as you know, when you look at your life cycle analysis from start to finish, you have to consider what the power mix is and could be. And unfortunately, at Sabine Pass, the power would come from Texas, which is, as you know, a predominantly coal fired power generation most of the year. And that's not , that\u2019s more, not quite as clean on a life cycle analysis as having gas fired turbines do the compression for us there. So that's what led to our decision on larger trains. It just made sense for Sabine.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from the line of Spiro Dounis with Citi.\nSpiro Dounis: Thanks. Operator. Good morning, team. First question is just on EPC costs, seen escalation, I guess, abroad, just given all the inflation, seeing labor shortages as well lingering theme here and really across the rest of energy. Historically, you and B Bechtel have a great track record there, managing costs and timelines. So just curious, as you guys think about those challenges on some of your upcoming projects. Are you balancing the ability to offer a competitive liquefaction fee while also maintaining your target returns on these future projects?\nJack Fusco : Now, look, we have a very strong relationship with Bechtel. It's been built over the last decade. They, with us, have gotten together. We've used limited notices to proceed. We've paid at risk money early to lock in materials and supplies, and we've been able to manage the inflation and escalation very effectively to meet our returns that we all have told you about in the past. So I would expect us to be able to do the same here. In regards to labor shortages, we haven't seen it. We alluded to the fact that Bechtel is ahead of schedule on Corpus Stage 3. It's my expectation that they continue to deliver well ahead of the guaranteed dates that are in the contract. I'm witnessing it again as we look at Stage 3. So I think for the right employer for the right cost and Bechtel is a great employer on the Gulf Coast that they're able to attract and retain some very productive Gulf Coast workers.\nSpiro Dounis: Great. Second question is just on spot volumes. You put away quite a bit on that side since the last update, so I'm just curious if that level of activity has continued. And as you think about placing the remaining 50 TBtu open for spot, do you see value in waiting a little bit longer or just given some of those green shoots you mentioned? Or could we actually see you close out that remaining book even before the next earnings call?\nJack Fusco : Spiro, it's a great question and I have Corey Grindal, sitting next to me, Corey and the team. As you know, Corey is our new Chief Operating Officer as of this year, but prior to that, he was in London and Corey and the London team have done a great job at putting away some of these cargoes for us. I'll let Corey answer the question.\nCorey Grindal: I think the simplest answer, Spiro, is we're going to have to wait on some of them because with our operational track record and the reputation that we try to keep, we're going to have to keep some behind for later in the year, possible activities like hurricanes, as well as we have some planned maintenance that we're going to do this summer that we've been very clear about, we keep some behind just in case our maintenance takes a little bit longer. So as we have opportunities and cargoes get firmed up, we'll continue to sell them. But what we've sold is pretty much all of our firm cargoes right now, and we'll just continue to place it throughout the year.\nJack Fusco : And I'll just add Spiro, as people think about the guidance and clearly people were pretty focused on how much did we proactively sell going into this call. The CMI team did an incredible job selling probably over $20 last year going into this year and still over $10 this year. And as you think about the $8 billion and $8.5 billion of EBITDA with only 50 TBtu really outstanding. That's priced right now on the curb sub $10 dollars. So it's less than a $0.5 billion in the whole grand scheme of things. So it just shows how locked in things are right now and I imagine Corey and the team will sell that as they can efficiently and we'll come up with a smaller number than 50 on the next call and the call after that.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from the line of Sean Morgan with Evercore.\nSean Morgan: Hey, thanks guys for taking the question. So I think one thing that obviously the market's been a little bit surprised by the scale and scope of Sabine Pass and I think that's going to be a positive surprise as we kind of go through the next couple of weeks in terms of people sort of reevaluating CQP growth. But CQP has historically been very attuned to the investors. They're attuned to sort of the distribution. It looks like with the guidance now, you're basically maintaining most of this variable distribution component along with your sort of base distribution. So how do you sort of thinking about how you're balancing future CapEx to scope out and grow Sabine Pass with kind of the distribution mandate that you have?\nAnatol Feygin: Sure I mentioned it a little earlier on, but the fact that we came out last year with the base plus variable DPU was for this purpose to give us the flexibility at some point down the line, we can go back to the base distribution and decide how much is variable that we're willing to distribute out and hold on to the rest as we build accretive projects that clearly meet all our investment parameters. So right now we're talking about a four to $4 to $4.25 DPU for \u201823. Our base distribution is $3.10. So there's at least a $1 or so in there of variable distribution. And that's because look, we're not going to be spending all that much money on this project during development, maybe 100 plus million dollars. And if you count for a few hundred million dollars of debt pay down, yes, we can to pay over $4. But when it comes down to it, in a few years, say \u201825, \u201826, \u201827 timeframe, yes, we would ramp down that dollar of incremental variable distribution so that we could live within cash flows and just fund the project steadily over time with that cash flow and the debt.\nSean Morgan: Thanks, Jack. That's really helpful. And then on the expansion, I think this is going to be pretty exciting for LNG investors as well. Sort of puts that growth catalyst back on the table that's maybe been a little bit lacking since Stage 3 kind of went in everyone's model. So question on the existing CMI marketing agreement between SPL and CMI, will that be enforced for the 20 million Sabine Pass expansion as well? And sort of if that's the case, what are we looking at in terms of sort of incremental volumes to CMI on a run rate basis, that'd be like three to five Mtpa per year once it's sort of commercialized and done and dusted.\nJack Fusco : A few things there in that question, but the agreement between CMI and both projects are consistent, and it would be the same for the expansions at Sabine and the expansions at Corpus that would pay up to $3 to take the volumes around the world. So that's answer number one. And then the second question was how much volume this year? Yes, in terms of how much volume, we're going to stick to our parameters. We're not going to FID if we don't hold ourselves to the same parameters we've done in the past. So we're talking about 90% contracted when it's all done and dusted. Meaning that, yes, there's going to be a couple of million tons, two to three, let's say, of open capacity added to the CMI coffers to manage over time, but that's about it.\nSean Morgan: Okay, thanks. Obviously, we don't want to over promise, but future debottleneck is kind of where I was getting to that higher range. But understood that you guys don't like to over promise, so we'll just leave it at that.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from the line of John Mackay with Goldman Sachs.\nJohn Mackay: Hey, thanks for the time. Maybe just thinking about the, I guess, new kind of boil-off unit proposed for this expansion and then also the CCS that you're going to tie into it. Is this -- are both of those options at Corpus on the existing footprint and kind of once the Stage 3 is online, or if not, maybe, why not maybe difference between two sites or something.\nJack Fusco : They are at Corpus. Corpus is a little bit different. It's not currently in our plans, neither the CCS or the boil-off gas unit right now. So it would require us to file with FERC and get approval for those. But we hope to get the technology down at Sabine, get comfortable with it, all aspects of it, and then roll it out to the rest of our facilities and Corpus would be our next choice.\nJohn Mackay: Thanks for that. And you touched on this a little bit earlier, but just going back for getting all this gas to Sabine going to kind of require longer, higher pipeline access. Just are your customers and I know it's early days, but are your customers kind of looking at that, at your ability to secure that feed gas before they're willing to commit to it? Or is that track record kind of good enough there.\nJack Fusco : John, today we bought 7.5 Bcf from 70 different producers throughout all of North America, including Canada, and we delivered it to our facilities and it will be processed and loaded up on two tankers and shipped off. So this is a blip in the grand scheme of things. We, as you know, we're the largest purchaser of physical gas in the US and the largest holder of gas transport pipeline. We like touching all of the basins. Because we have to deliver the molecule, so you should expect us to come up with a creative solution.\nOperator: And the last question comes from the line of Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.\nCraig Shere: Hi. Thanks for fitting me in. I just have one. As we think longer term about this one to one ratio for capital allocation, when you're an FID-ing projects at perhaps 3x EBITDA, which should be further balance sheet stabilizing, does that particularly if there are large projects, does that alter the longer term need for the one to one ratio?\nZach Davis: Want to correct the 3x EBITDA first. Well, it is around 3x, give or take, when we can build on a CapEx to EBITDA at 6x, and we do 50:50. But again, that alone is, yes, going to be pretty helpful to delever the story over time as we get through construction. But mind you, construction is going to take four to five years where we're going to have the debt before the EBITDA shows up. So we're going to be pretty mindful of that, that we continue to look just as good on a Bloomberg screen as we do today as we build these projects. So the one to one is going to continue. Clearly, we need to catch up on the buyback over the coming quarters and year plus to get back to one to one. And then you could see us follow through with that cadence through that 2026 time frame that was the capital allocation guidance in September, and we'll go from there. But this way we can build these multibillion dollar projects accretively and still look pretty darn good on an LTM basis.\nCraig Shere: Got you. And I guess as a follow up, you mentioned, Zach, about four to five years. Given these are larger size trains than you've ever built before, even though it's brownfield. Can we see the first liquefaction and still under four years, or would it naturally take longer?\nJack Fusco : I would imagine the technology is the same, Craig, it's just a little bit bigger. So I would imagine that the ENC team can deliver like they have in the past and where the guarantee dates may be four years, the actual first LNG will be significantly faster than that.\nJack Fusco : And thank you, everybody. We appreciate all the support and we hope to see you all soon.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Anatol Feygin",
            "content": "Thanks Jack and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide 9. An accelerated post pandemic recovery followed by the curtailment of Russian gas flows into Europe made for a sharp increase in LNG demand in 2022, with limited new liquefaction capacity and several production outages, the LNG market remained extremely tight throughout the year as we saw prices reach all-time highs and remain elevated. Despite the supply side challenges, global LNG trade grew by approximately 5% from 2021, or an additional approximately 19 million tons. Overall, US exports increased 9% year-on-year, up 6.3 million tons to 76.5 Mtpa in 2022 despite the freeport outage during the second half of the year. US LNG represented nearly 40% of the growth in global LNG supply, and the early completion of our 9 Train meaningfully contributed to that growth. As Zack noted, our increase in production enabled Cheniere to help answer Europe's call for reliable, flexible natural gas supply. Having lost Russia as a significant supplier, Europe became a substantial demand center for LNG, attracting approximately 70% of all US LNG in 2022 as prices reached record levels and redirected destination flexible US LNG volumes to address the deficit. The TTF monthly settlement prices averaged around $40 per MMBtu in 2022, over 180% higher than the $14 average in 2021. In the fourth quarter, TTF monthly settlement prices averaged $42 per MMBtu or 46% higher year-on-year, but significantly lower than the peak of nearly $100 in MMBtu in late August. Similarly, the 2022 JKM average settlement price increased by over 125% year-on-year to an average of $34 per MMBtu with the fourth quarter average price increasing 38% year-on-year to an average of $38, but well below the summer peak of nearly 70. In the US, Henry Hub price averaged nearly $7.22, but has moderated considerably since the peak in September and is now trading well below $3 per MMBtu. This rapid correction, driven by North American production growth, again demonstrates the relative attractiveness of Cheniere's Henry Hub denominated long-term FOB and DS contracts and underpins producers desire to diversify away from solely domestic indices. Despite the retreat of global gas prices to prewar levels beginning in the fourth quarter and into 2023 on the back of a mild winter and demand reduction efforts in Europe, the overall market remains volatile. And we expect volatility to remain elevated as Europe sorts out its near and long term gas supply strategies and the impact of a post COVID China on the market becomes more apparent. Let's now turn to slide 10 to address regional dynamics in some more detail. As noted, much of the flexible LNG in the market was directed to Europe and was able to offset a large part approximately 84% of the 74 Bcm, or 55 million ton reduction in Russian gas supply. Europe's LNG imports totaled over 120 million of which 110 million tons went to EU plus UK, which is a 69% increase year-on-year. US LNG to the block plus the UK totaled 48 million tons, a 165% increase year-on-year. Clearly, destination flexible US LNG was able to answer Europe's call for natural gas supply in 2022. Throughout the year, the EU implemented several extraordinary measures to mitigate the potential impact of a complete cutoff of Russian gas and a potentially cold winter amid low nuclear and hydrogeneration output. As Zack noted, the challenges that European nations faced were significant. But these measures, along with mild weather and demand price response, enabled Europe to replenish its inventories and avoid a potentially crippling energy crisis in the near term. Some of the coordinated initiatives included a regulatory push to immediately increase LNG import infrastructure, diversify supply sources and reduce natural gas demand. To date, five new regasification terminals have commenced service in Europe since September, a key enabler of Europe's ability to grow LNG imports to record levels in the fourth quarter. Demand reduction efforts have also been made across Europe. Residential, commercial and industrial customers were able to reduce aggregate demand by an estimated 12% during the year as power generation resorted to increase coal usage, a trend that we think will reverse in 2023 given elevated gas storage levels and again, a mild weather outlook. At present, it appears the European gas system will make it through this winter without the enforced supply restrictions many had feared. Amid historically high LNG prices, the global inflationary environment, lower economic activity and lower market liquidity, some of the more price sensitive Asian buyers withdrew from the spot LNG market. Imports into Asia declined by 20 million tons, or 7%, year-on-year, with nearly 16 million tons of the drop attributable to China. This was the first substantial annual decline in LNG imports since the country began importing in 2006. China's economy faced extended COVID restrictions, a property sector crisis and severe drought, all of which led to a drop in total gas demand of 4 Bcm in 2022, with a decline led by the industrial and power generation sectors. Similar to parts of Europe, low hydro output and high gas prices supported increased coal generation in the second half of 2022. However, with JKM and TTF prices moderating, we expect to see price sensitive Asian LNG demand resume on indications of higher industrial activity in China as COVID restrictions are lifted. The latter, of course, could have a potentially material impact on next winter's global balance. Let's move to slide 11. Europe shift away from Russia created an immediate supply gap of approximately 70 Bcm in 2022, which will likely rise to approximately 110 Bcm in 2023. Assuming Russian pipeline supplies are eventually fully curtailed, the gap created of 100 Mtpa is equivalent to around a quarter of the current global LNG market. The magnitude of this supply shock stressed the global LNG market in 2022, resulting in some demand destruction in certain regions during the year. More important, however, as Zack noted, the market dynamics of \u201822 highlighted the critical role of LNG in ensuring energy security, underscoring the importance of long-term contracted reliable LNG supply in the global energy mix. While short-term dynamics have dominated headlines and narratives over the last year, the long term fundamentals are central to our strategic planning and positioning, and the need for further investment in LNG capacity was again laid bare last year. Over the next few decades, both the supply and demand side are supportive of new liquefaction infrastructure. In addition to high project development hurdles, capital intensity and long construction timelines for new LNG facilities, legacy plant utilization rates worldwide continued to decline as a result of outages, feedstock limitations and fleet inefficiencies, as well as competing domestic demand in some markets. Since 2010, the volume produced from these legacy projects has declined by 23%, or over 25 million tons, further contributing to the need for more capacity. While these facilities produced about a quarter of all total volume last year, their contribution will likely decline over time as feedstock resources deplete, their ability to export declines and their performance potentially degrades. Meanwhile, investment in downstream LNG infrastructure continues to grow, not only in Europe, but also in other parts of the world. Over 370 million tons of regas capacity is under development, which is equivalent to about 80% of global LNG trade today. Furthermore, nine new markets are expected to enter the LNG trade in the next two years, including Vietnam, the Philippines, and Ghana, just to name a few. Investments in new LNG supply are critically needed not only to address the current market imbalance and meet the expected long term demand growth, but also to offset declining production from certain legacy production facilities. To this end, Cheniere is doing its part with over 10 million tons under construction and another 20 plus million tons in the permitting process we aim to leverage our many advantages to economically contribute to the overall reliability, security, affordability and scale of the global LNG market. With commercial support for capacity beyond Corpus Christi Stage 3 in hand, the team is well positioned to leverage that success as we develop and commercialize the SPL expansion project. With that, I will turn the call over to Jack to review our financial results and guidance. Hey, Brian. Good morning. Thanks. We've had very good engagement throughout \u201822, as you can imagine, as we've discussed in the prepared remarks and throughout the last few years, the value of that long term contract, the stability, reliability and getting these volumes at a quarter or a third of that headline price has never been clearer than it was throughout \u201822. So we're very encouraged by what we're seeing. While we obviously saw short term demand destruction, to your point, most countries remain very committed to gas, continue to invest substantially in infrastructure, whether that's China, India, other Southeast Asian markets, et cetera. Europe, of course. And we're very encouraged by a very brief mix of committed interest to our product. So feel very optimistic about the hand we're dealt and obviously very excited that now the SPL expansion is out there for us to really hit the ground running. Yes, just to dive in a little bit to your question, as you know, the integration of upstream infrastructure solutions and gas supply has been a key success factor of ours and be one of our main kind of structural advantages. So we take that extremely seriously and we'll have robust solutions for that. And the customer mix, the crystal ball is fairly similar to what we have experienced over the last three to four years in a very healthy, credit worthy mix that does include producer customers, which partially includes not only the liquefaction fee but also the gas supply component and the opportunities to optimize those volumes flexibly downstream. So you are going to see from the commercial side producers, you are going to see European and Asian buyers and I think everyone is excited about this opportunity to continue to serve the market with this growth. Sure I mentioned it a little earlier on, but the fact that we came out last year with the base plus variable DPU was for this purpose to give us the flexibility at some point down the line, we can go back to the base distribution and decide how much is variable that we're willing to distribute out and hold on to the rest as we build accretive projects that clearly meet all our investment parameters. So right now we're talking about a four to $4 to $4.25 DPU for \u201823. Our base distribution is $3.10. So there's at least a $1 or so in there of variable distribution. And that's because look, we're not going to be spending all that much money on this project during development, maybe 100 plus million dollars. And if you count for a few hundred million dollars of debt pay down, yes, we can to pay over $4. But when it comes down to it, in a few years, say \u201825, \u201826, \u201827 timeframe, yes, we would ramp down that dollar of incremental variable distribution so that we could live within cash flows and just fund the project steadily over time with that cash flow and the debt."

            "content": "Thank you, Randy. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning ad we will review an incredibly rewarding and transformational 2022 and provide our outlook for what we expect to be another very busy and successful year for Cheniere in 2023. To say 2022 was an incredible year for Cheniere would be an understatement. Disruption and volatility dominated energy markets the world over as geopolitical tension and the weaponization of energy supply turbocharged already volatile markets suffering from years of underinvestment in infrastructure. The criticality of reliable natural gas supply in a normally functioning energy system and the vital role natural gas plays throughout a developed economy was put on full display as the world watched some of the wealthiest nations in the developed world scramble to ensure reliable energy supply for their populations and economies. And while it appears now that a severe energy crisis in Europe over the winter has been narrowly avoided, the situation there only further reinforces the vital need for a reliable, affordable, secure and diverse energy mix. At Cheniere, we were proud to play an important role in helping balance global energy markets at a time when it was needed most. With the early completion and advanced startup of Train 6 at Sabine Pass, as well as optimizing our maintenance schedule, we produced approximately 44 million tons of LNG during 2022, 72% of which was directed to Europe, further illustrating the value of destination flexibility which Cheniere pioneered. And of course, over the summer we reached FID on Corpus Christi Stage 3, which will bring an additional 10 million tons of much needed LNG to the global market and our long term customers beginning in 2025. Over the course of 2022, the focus of the global natural gas industry for both suppliers and consumers, crystallized for the trilemma of energy security, affordability, and long term environmental performance. On each of these critical points, Cheniere offers a market leading solution which instills my confidence in our growth potential, which I'll speak to in a few minutes. Please turn to slide 5 where I will review key operational and financial highlights from the fourth quarter and full year 2022 and introduce our 2023 financial guidance. We generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year total to approximately $11.6 billion above the high end of our guidance range. We generated approximately $2.3 billion of distributable cash flow in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year 2022 DCF total to approximately $8.7 billion, also above the high end of our guidance range. Looking back at the original guidance provided in November of 2021, we beat the midpoint of each of those guidance ranges by over $5 billion, illustrating the extraordinary nature of the global gas markets and the value of our ability to be a reliable operator and supplier during the year. For the fourth quarter, we generated over $3.9 billion of net income, and our annual total is a positive $1.4 billion. Our net income continues to be impacted by noncash unrealized derivatives, which worked in our favor in the fourth quarter as global gas markets moderated. During the fourth quarter, Zach and his team made excellent progress on our capital allocation plan, deploying billions of dollars into capital return via debt repayment, share repurchases, and increased dividends as well into disciplined accretive growth at Corpus Christi Stage 3. He's sitting here next to me, anxious to cover capital allocation in more detail, so I'll stop there before stealing too much of his thunder. Operationally, the fourth quarter and full year 2022 were exceptional. Fortifying Cheniere status as a leading global operator, reliably producing LNG with safety at the foundation of every action we take. During the quarter, we exported a record 166 cargoes from our facilities, bringing our annual total to a record of 638 cargoes. I'd like to recognize Cheniere's approximately 1,550 professionals who worked tirelessly in 2022 for demonstrating Cheniere's execution and operations leadership to the global marketplace and helping enable the outstanding results we reported this morning, all while achieving record safety metrics throughout the year. Now, shifting our focus to 2023, I'm pleased to introduce our 2023 financial guidance of $8 billion to $8.5 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA, $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion in distributable cash flow and $4 to $4.25 in per unit distributions of CQP. I am pleased to provide 2023 guidance figures that are significantly higher than our more normalized 9 Train run rate, and I believe that the stabilization of both prices and volatility in the international gas markets will support stronger and faster demand growth, ultimately, this should support my long-term health conviction and the structural shift to natural gas worldwide. Turn out to slide 6, where I'll cover my key priorities for 2023. First and foremost, we have an established track record earned over multiple years of delivering on our promises, and I expect that to be maintained in 2023. We have set ambitious but achievable guidance ranges for the year, and our focus will be on strengthening that track record by delivering on our financial guidance. In 2023, with less CMI volume and without the variable of new capacity entering service, we have a higher degree of visibility on our metrics than we did a year ago to hit our forecasted production estimates and continue to progress on our 2020 vision capital allocation plan. Second, we expect to lead with organic growth and have over 30 million tons currently under development or under construction. Our 40 plus billion in infrastructure investments is one of the biggest competitive advantages we have, as it enables economically advantaged capacity expansions such as Corpus Christi Stage 3. Construction activities at Stage 3 is progressing. And while it's too early to say we are ahead of schedule, since we are about 2% complete on construction, Bechtel was beginning to execute on some aspects of early construction ahead of plan. On the growth front beyond Stage 3, we are progressing through the prefiling process on midscale Trains 8, 9 at Corpus Christi, and we expect to submit the full filing to FERC before the end of the first quarter. Over at Sabine Pass, I hope you saw our announcement this morning that we have just initiated the permitting process for a significant capacity expansion there by submitting pre filing documentation to FERC. I'll discuss this project in more detail on the next slide, but we are extremely excited about developing this expansion of Sabine Pass, which could add approximately 20 million tons of additional capacity at the site. Moving this project through the engineering and construction and permitting process will be a major priority in 2023. Anatol, Ramzi and the team are actively commercializing this new potential investment. Third, we'll further advance our climate and sustainability initiatives, which we'd like to describe as actionable, not aspirational. Despite the industrywide focus on energy security in 2022, improving environmental performance remains a long-term goal and establishing and maintaining environmental competitiveness is critical for continued natural gas adoption and therefore the long-term resiliency of LNG. The programs we have discussed on recent calls such as our QMRV program, our cargo emission tags, and joining the UN's oil and Gas Methane Partnership are all efforts on which I expect continuous focus, improvement and refinement to further reinforce genre's leadership position on these crucial efforts. Now turn to slide 7 where I'll share some details about our next major capacity expansion at Sabine Pass. We've just commenced the permitting process on this large scale project by submitting the prefiling documentation to FERC. We expect to submit the full filing before the end of the year and look forward to working with FERC on permitting this major brownfield capacity expansion. The Sabine Pass expansion project is being designed for approximately 20 million tons of LNG. The project is expected to consist of up to three large scale Liquefaction trains utilizing the same Liquefaction process technology that's deployed on the six operating trains at SPL. Each train is expected to have a nominal production capacity of approximately 6.5 million tons. The project is also expected to include a Boil-Off Gas Re-Liquefaction Unit which would add almost a million tons of production, and two full containment LNG storage tanks. You can see the rendering of the project on the slide. We have been hard at work on early stage development of this project and have Bechtel already engaged on front end engineering and design work and are excited about transforming the engineering drawing on the slide into reality at Sabine Pass. We will develop the Sabine Pass expansion project utilizing the same rigorous and financially disciplined approach to project development and capital investment you've become accustomed to from Cheniere. The SPL expansion project is consistent with the significant growth plans we laid out in our capital allocation presentation in September. We showed a potential 90 million ton platform across the Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi. Our infrastructure platform is an enormous competitive advantage which this project is expected to capitalize on in order to deliver Brownfield economics. As the world calls for more LNG capacity, Cheniere is in an economically and environmentally advantaged position to provide that incremental capacity. We look forward to updating you on this large scale growth project at Sabine Pass as well as the developments at Corpus as we move through this process. Thank you again for your continued support of Cheniere. I'll now turn the call over to Anatol who will provide an update on the LNG market. Thanks Brian. I'll turn it over to Anatol. He can talk about the demand growth that we're seeing across the globe. Thanks, Jeremy. As you can tell from our prepared remarks, we are so excited about the Sabine Pass expansion. If you look at trying to see what slide number it was, Randy 7 of ours, you can see the rendition from Bechtel of what it would look like. That property is currently being utilized right now as lay down area. So it's primed and ready to go, which is one of the advantages that we have as a brownfield site. The infrastructure is there at the facility and there's a huge push and pull from the customer base worldwide. So you all remember back in 2016 when I started. We had 13 foundation customers; we now have over 33. Those are customers that take at least a cargo a month and have a tenure of over 20 years. And that customer diversity has grown dramatically as our contract structures have grown between FOB, DS, IPMS, et cetera, and who knows what's next but that Anatol and Ramzi have in their back pocket. But I will turn it over to Jack to talk about some of the more specific details. Yes. Jeremy. So on the Boil-Off Gas, right now, the Boil-Off Gas is the facility gets redirected back into the trains and gets reprocessed, and that takes up space in the train. So our production numbers look the same, but our feed gas flows aren't as high as they otherwise would be. And we have run the math and figured that the Boil-Off Gas Re-Liquefaction Unit would substantially help us increase the production throughout the rest of the facility. So that's an added benefit that we don't currently have at either of the sites. And then secondly, you mentioned some of the heat recovery units. As you know, I've been in power my whole life, and I think being able to capture the hot flue gas out of the end of the gas turbines, run them, produce steam, use that to make power, just makes the whole process more efficient, makes us much more competitive overall. So we need to utilize that waste heat, and it helps with our environmental profile. So you should expect us to do what's right, and that would be utilizing that waste heat and reinjecting or sequestering the AGRU stream that comes off the gas stream efficiently. Sure. So getting to IG is more than just symbolic. We actually have lower pricing now on our working capital facilities and revolvers. And both the corporate revolvers are now officially unsecured, which gives us even more flexibility going into the future. So that's all helpful. In addition to that, all the optimization that CMI does sometimes even sourcing from third parties. We're not posting nearly as much as we used to with LCS and things like that. We can just use a parent guarantee considering CMI is wholly owned by CEI. So that's pretty helpful. And then in terms of open credit, we're getting more that's a work in progress as we speak. But basically, when it comes to financial derivatives and hedging, that's still all about liquidity. Yes, we might have a little open capacity, but as we saw with the volatility this past year, that's still a liquidity thing. And what I mentioned on the call, we literally have $10 billion of total liquidity with the term loan that's available, the revolvers and the cash on hand. So we have legged in a bit on financial hedging. And that's been helpful partially to why we're down to only 50 TBtu really open going forward. My operating team never ceases to stop amazing me with what they're able to do as far as our debottlenecking and optimization efforts. So I would say yes and yes. It's our intent that we would commercialize these trains like we have in the past and, as Jack said, could potentially build them individually or in stages. What you said, Jean Ann, so we -- very fair question. And we've thought about a lot, as you know, and we've discussed over the years what that opportunity could potentially buy us. And as you saw last year, as we were commercializing Corpus Stage 3, we ended up commercializing things that were well beyond Stage 3 and are sitting in an enviable position of having that portfolio of offtake in hand with almost 3 million tons at our option to convert to SPA. So it's great to have this maps and renderings, of course help, but as you said, that reputation and what the Cheniere platform has armed us with on the commercial side is that great track record and execution that really is unmatched in the LNG market. So it's great to have this in hand, but it is not, we don't see it as a disadvantage that don't have the full 20 million tons approved today. Yes. So, Jean Ann, now we have all the tools in our toolkit. And when we looked at Sabine Pass and looked at potential different power solutions, the most economical trains there are the large scale ConocoPhillips trains versus the smaller midscale units. And as you know, when you look at your life cycle analysis from start to finish, you have to consider what the power mix is and could be. And unfortunately, at Sabine Pass, the power would come from Texas, which is, as you know, a predominantly coal fired power generation most of the year. And that's not , that's more, not quite as clean on a life cycle analysis as having gas fired turbines do the compression for us there. So that's what led to our decision on larger trains. It just made sense for Sabine. Now, look, we have a very strong relationship with Bechtel. It's been built over the last decade. They, with us, have gotten together. We've used limited notices to proceed. We've paid at risk money early to lock in materials and supplies, and we've been able to manage the inflation and escalation very effectively to meet our returns that we all have told you about in the past. So I would expect us to be able to do the same here. In regards to labor shortages, we haven't seen it. We alluded to the fact that Bechtel is ahead of schedule on Corpus Stage 3. It's my expectation that they continue to deliver well ahead of the guaranteed dates that are in the contract. I'm witnessing it again as we look at Stage 3. So I think for the right employer for the right cost and Bechtel is a great employer on the Gulf Coast that they're able to attract and retain some very productive Gulf Coast workers. Spiro, it's a great question and I have Corey Grindal, sitting next to me, Corey and the team. As you know, Corey is our new Chief Operating Officer as of this year, but prior to that, he was in London and Corey and the London team have done a great job at putting away some of these cargoes for us. I'll let Corey answer the question. And I'll just add Spiro, as people think about the guidance and clearly people were pretty focused on how much did we proactively sell going into this call. The CMI team did an incredible job selling probably over $20 last year going into this year and still over $10 this year. And as you think about the $8 billion and $8.5 billion of EBITDA with only 50 TBtu really outstanding. That's priced right now on the curb sub $10 dollars. So it's less than a $0.5 billion in the whole grand scheme of things. So it just shows how locked in things are right now and I imagine Corey and the team will sell that as they can efficiently and we'll come up with a smaller number than 50 on the next call and the call after that. A few things there in that question, but the agreement between CMI and both projects are consistent, and it would be the same for the expansions at Sabine and the expansions at Corpus that would pay up to $3 to take the volumes around the world. So that's answer number one. And then the second question was how much volume this year? Yes, in terms of how much volume, we're going to stick to our parameters. We're not going to FID if we don't hold ourselves to the same parameters we've done in the past. So we're talking about 90% contracted when it's all done and dusted. Meaning that, yes, there's going to be a couple of million tons, two to three, let's say, of open capacity added to the CMI coffers to manage over time, but that's about it. They are at Corpus. Corpus is a little bit different. It's not currently in our plans, neither the CCS or the boil-off gas unit right now. So it would require us to file with FERC and get approval for those. But we hope to get the technology down at Sabine, get comfortable with it, all aspects of it, and then roll it out to the rest of our facilities and Corpus would be our next choice. John, today we bought 7.5 Bcf from 70 different producers throughout all of North America, including Canada, and we delivered it to our facilities and it will be processed and loaded up on two tankers and shipped off. So this is a blip in the grand scheme of things. We, as you know, we're the largest purchaser of physical gas in the US and the largest holder of gas transport pipeline. We like touching all of the basins. Because we have to deliver the molecule, so you should expect us to come up with a creative solution. I would imagine the technology is the same, Craig, it's just a little bit bigger. So I would imagine that the ENC team can deliver like they have in the past and where the guarantee dates may be four years, the actual first LNG will be significantly faster than that. And thank you, everybody. We appreciate all the support and we hope to see you all soon."

So as we have opportunities and cargoes get firmed up, we'll continue to sell them. But what we've sold is pretty much all of our firm cargoes right now, and we'll just continue to place it throughout the year."

            "name": "Zach Davis",
            "content": "Thanks Anatol and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results and key financial accomplishments and 2023 financial guidance. As Zack and Anatol have noted, 2022 was quite a year for our company, our stakeholders and our industry as a whole. And the financial results we reported today once again reflect the Cheniere team's unwavering commitment to operational excellence, execution and financial discipline, which is especially important throughout this period of prolonged volatility in the global energy markets. Turning to slide 13, for the fourth quarter and full year, we generated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $3.1 billion and $11.6 billion, respectively, and distributable cash flow of approximately $2.3 billion and $8.7 billion, or approximately $35 of annual cash flow per share. With the full year results exceeding the high end of our latest guidance ranges provided in September. Thanks to these full year results ending up close to $5.5 billion higher than our original 2022 guidance. We've been able to transform our capital allocation objectives now as an investment grade company with Stage 3 construction fully underway and a sharpened focus on more robust shareholder returns in the form of our upsized $4 billion buyback program and our competitively growing dividend. During the fourth quarter and full year, we recognized an income 591 and 2,317 TBtu of physical LNG, respectively which included 581 and 2,288 TBtu from our projects and 10 and 29 TBtu sourced from third parties, respectively. Approximately 80% of these LNG volumes recognized in income in both periods were sold under long term SPA or IPM agreements with terms greater than 10 years. Our fourth quarter and full year results once again were supported by increased margins realized on our LNG delivered, which were primarily driven by the elevated market pricing throughout the year and higher volumes produced at both of our sites, thanks to the early completion and ramp up of SPL Train 6 and the maintenance optimization announced in May. Our total margins also benefited from portfolio optimization activities in addition to the proceeds from the early termination of the Chevron TUA. In addition, I would like to highlight that we generated net income of $3.9 billion and $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. As we've noted in prior earnings calls, our net income line is impacted by the unrealized noncash derivative impact, primarily related to the mismatch of accounting methodology for the purchase of natural gas and the corresponding sale of LNG under our long term IPM agreements. While this resulted in unfavorable changes throughout most of 2022 as international gas prices rose, during the fourth quarter, the moderating of international gas price curves provided a significant benefit, allowing us to hit an inflection point with cumulative positive net income for the preceding 12-months for the first time in a few years. Before discussing our financial guidance and priorities for 2023, I'd like to recap some of our key financial accomplishments for 2022 and how effective we've been in allocating the capital back into the business and to our shareholders. First and foremost, I'm pleased to highlight that our commitment to achieving and maintaining a sustainable balance sheet was recognized by the rating agencies, with 13 distinct upgrades to our credit ratings across our corporate structure over the last year, including the achievement of two investment grade ratings at each of our parent entities. solidifying Cheniere as officially investment grade. In November, S&P upgraded Cheniere and CQP by two notches to BBB, with a stable outlook marking Cheniere's first and CQP second investor grade rating not long after Fitch initiated its coverage of Cheniere with a BBB minus rating and a stable outlook. As you all know, achieving investment grade has long been a goal of ours, as we believe it best positions Cheniere for the future and validates the long-term value and sustainability of our platform. During the quarter, we prepaid approximately $2.2 billion in consolidated long-term indebtedness, bringing our total debt paydown to just over $6.6 billion through the fourth quarter since launching our original capital allocation plan in 2021, with over $5 billion of debt reduction in 2022 alone. Since our third quarter call in November, we also issued $500 million of senior secured amortizing notes due 2037 in the public and private debt capital markets, the proceeds of which were used along with cash on hand to redeem the remaining SPL 2023 notes. In December, we also repurchased over 750 million of the outstanding 2024 notes at CCH pursuant to a tender offer. And in January redeemed the remaining nearly $500 million outstanding with cash on hand. We also continued to utilize our open market repurchase program and in the fourth quarter repurchased over $400 million in principle of outstanding CCH notes with maturities ranging from 2025 to 2039. With all that said, today we have almost $10 billion of consolidated available liquidity, including our bank facilities, investment grade balance sheets throughout the Cheniere structure, and our nearest maturity is not until next year. I'm very proud of what our team has accomplished at such an accelerated pace, as each of these transactions reflects our focus on managing our debt across the corporate structure, opportunistically and strategically for the long term. As we mentioned back in November, now that we've solidified our balance sheet and reached our initial investment grade goals, we have balanced out our priorities, recalibrating our debt pay down to share repurchase ratio from four to one, to one to one as outlined in our revised capital allocation from last September. In fact, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares for over $700 million, bringing our total shares repurchased during 2022 to 9.3 million for approximately $1.4 billion. Given our one to one cumulative goal over time, you can expect that we will continue the share buyback momentum with growing relative buyback allocations for 2023. In order to achieve our cumulative one to one target ratio with debt paydown. We also paid $1.0385 per common share in dividends last year, inclusive of a 20% increase for the third quarter, and declared and paid our 6th quarterly dividend of $0.0395 for the fourth quarter this past month. We intend to follow through with our previous guidance of growing our dividend annually by approximately 10% into the mid-2020s through construction of Stage 3. Turn now to slide 14, where I will discuss our 2023 guidance and update you on our open capacity for the remainder of the year. For 2023, our guidance is $8 billion to $8.5 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $5.5 billion to $6 billion in distributable cash flow or over $20 of cash flow per share. These ranges reflect current international gas prices curves as well as our significantly smaller open position relative to 2022, given the start of several long term contracts this year and our planned maintenance at Sabine Pass. 2022 was an unprecedented year, with EBITDA and DCF approaching double and triple our respective 9 Train run rate guidance levels for those metrics. 2023 is shaping up to be another incredible year with guidance ranges multiple billions of dollars above the run rate levels for both, thanks to proactive management of our open capacity despite a higher contribution from long- term contracts in 2023. Our focus remains on achieving the 2020 vision of generating over $20 billion of cash and over $20 DCF per share, and our expectation on accomplishing that plan hasn't wavered despite the moderation in near-term prices highlighting the stability and visibility of our long-term cash flow profile. With regard to open capacity, we have less than 70 TBtu of unsold LNG remaining 20, which are reserved for long term origination, and we currently forecast that a $1 change in market margin would impact EBITDA by approximately $50 million for the balance of 2023. The marketing team has done an excellent job proactively selling our open capacity since November from 150 TBtu, which has allowed us to come out with this guidance range of over $8 billion today and keep us on track with our 2020 vision. In addition, our results could be impacted by the timing of certain year end cargoes heading into 2024. Our distributable cash flow for 2023 could also be affected by certain contemplated changes in the tax code under the IRA. However, the guidance provided today is based on the current IRA tax law guidance, in which we would not qualify for the minimum corporate tax of 15% this year. However, both of these dynamics would mainly affect timing and not materially impact our cumulative cash flow generation through the mid-2020s as we think about overall capital allocation deployment. Looking back on 2022, the year was filled with uncertainty across global energy markets, but the Cheniere team remained focused on what we could control the reliable, safe and seamless operations of Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi, which enabled us to achieve extraordinary results across our business, accelerate our follow through on our commitment to capital allocation by deploying over $8 billion towards our all the above plans, including our growth objectives with Stage 3. Our conviction and the critical long-term role of natural gas across the globe to address the trilemma of energy security, affordability and long-term environmental performance has only grown in the wake of energy market volatility last year. We are positioning Cheniere for the future in everything that we do, including our accretive growth projects, our investment grade balance sheet, and our long term commitment to generating meaningful and sustainable shareholder returns. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions. Hey, this is Zach, and I think you got it right. But the over $700 million of buybacks and Q4 was the most we've ever done strategically as we were thinking about late last year and early this year. We were really just trying to take care of the ratings. And then we overloaded the debt pay down to get there once and for all with Fitch and S&P. So though the guidance is one to one, we did pay down a bit more debt in the last quarter or so. So it is time to catch up this year and going forward to get back to one to one on a cumulative basis. And as you think about how much debt paydown we did over the last year was like $5 plus billion just in 2022, there's probably about $2 billion plus buybacks on a relative basis to debt pay down that needs to happen over the next year or two. So we'll be keenly focused on that and obviously not a bad time to be buying back for at lower levels than we thought we would be at this point. And it will just help us solidify the 2020 vision that we remain on track for. Sure. And then I'll hand it off to Anatol, can give you a little update on how he's thinking about contracting the project going forward. But basically we're just starting that permitting process and engineering work with Bechtel, and it's going to be quite some time before we spend even more than $100 million as we develop that over the coming year or so. But obviously, since it's brownfield, it should be cost advantage, but it is 20 million tons. So you can imagine we'll approach it like we've approached everything, likely even in stages, as we've done on previous projects, just to be more efficient with the bank debt, capital raises and spreading out the equity over time. But the key component for us as we think about financing it is the fact that we now have this base plus variable distribution policy at CQP. So we can go through a major expansion at Sabine, maintain the base distribution, which is over $3.10 and live within our cash flows and stick to the same amount of 50% give or take of leverage and make it work which is a pretty neat place to be. So CQP works as is, and obviously it goes without saying that we'll hold to our investment parameters, make sure that it's accretive not just on a value basis, but a credit basis, too. And have all the other bells and whistles that you're accustomed to having with us when we FID a project, Anatol? Want to correct the 3x EBITDA first. Well, it is around 3x, give or take, when we can build on a CapEx to EBITDA at 6x, and we do 50:50. But again, that alone is, yes, going to be pretty helpful to delever the story over time as we get through construction. But mind you, construction is going to take four to five years where we're going to have the debt before the EBITDA shows up. So we're going to be pretty mindful of that, that we continue to look just as good on a Bloomberg screen as we do today as we build these projects. So the one to one is going to continue. Clearly, we need to catch up on the buyback over the coming quarters and year plus to get back to one to one. And then you could see us follow through with that cadence through that 2026 time frame that was the capital allocation guidance in September, and we'll go from there. But this way we can build these multibillion dollar projects accretively and still look pretty darn good on an LTM basis."

Joining me this morning are Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO; Anatol Feygin, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Zach Davis, Executive Vice President and CFO.  Before we begin, I'd like to remind all listeners that our remarks, including answers to your questions, may contain forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from what is described in these statements.  Slide 2 of our presentation contains a discussion of those forward-looking statements and associated risks. In addition, we may include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the appendix to the slide presentation.  As part of our discussion of Cheniere's results, today's call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP, or CQP. We do not intend to cover CQP's results separately from those of Cheniere Energy, Inc.  The call agenda is shown on Slide 3. Jack will begin with operating and financial highlights, Anatol will then provide an update on the LNG market, and Zach will review our financial results and guidance. After prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A.  I'll now turn the call over to Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO.\nJack Fusco: Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today, and thank you all for your continued support of Cheniere. I'm pleased to be here this morning to highlight our third quarter 2022 results and achievements and discuss our positive outlook for the remainder of this year and into next, all of which continues to demonstrate Cheniere's market leadership and excellence throughout our business.  Since our capital allocation update in September, we have remained laser-focused on our operations, ensuring reliable LNG production and supply for our customers amidst global energy shortages and challenges. In fact, just last week, we had a daily production record for the company, producing well north of 7 TBtu of LNG and also a daily record at Sabine Pass of approximately 5 TBtu of LNG. My congratulations to the Cheniere professionals for a job well done.  Additionally, in conjunction with Bechtel's Engineering and Construction, we are off to a great start at Corpus Stage 3. We have rolled up our sleeves, hit the ground running and have already seen some early signs of potential acceleration on that project. Across the LNG market, volatility continues to dominate, driven by short-term supply-demand pressures. Recently, from record-breaking warmer weather, near-term prices have retreated from the highs we saw barely 2 months ago. Nevertheless, we are largely insulated from these price swings, given the highly contracted nature of our business, and we remain focused on long-term value creation as our priority with short-term market dislocations only serving to accelerate our long-term plans, as you heard from me and Zach in September.  Now please turn to Slide 5, where I will review some key operational, financial and strategic highlights from what was yet another very successful quarter. For the third quarter, we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.8 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $2.0 billion as margins in the LNG market remained significantly above historical norms and our focus on execution and our operational excellence program continued to be rewarded. Today, we are reconfirming our full year 2022 EBITDA and cash flow guidance, both of which were recently increased by over $1 billion when we announced our capital allocation plan in September.  In transit LNG shipments and commodity price, volatility increased the degree of difficulty in pinpointing the forecast, but we are tracking to the upper half of the EBITDA and DCF ranges currently. Later on this call, Zach will provide you with a few early data points on how 2023 is shaping up ahead of providing full year guidance on our February call.  As we've discussed, the reliability of our LNG operations is more critical than ever, given the volatility present in today's market. During the third quarter, we produced and exported 156 cargoes of LNG from our facilities. Of that, approximately 70% of that volume landed in Europe. By comparison, during the third quarter of last year, less than 30% of the volume produced by Cheniere landed in Europe. Not only does this shift underscore the value of our destination flexible LNG, which can quickly respond to market signals to reach end users of the greatest need, but is also providing meaningful energy volumes to Europe at a time when the region is facing significant challenges. The fact that these challenges could persist for a number of years has hastened a renewed focus on the criticality of energy security as governments and utilities the world over advance strategies to mitigate energy supply risks for the long term. Anatol will provide further insight to the current market dynamics in a few minutes.  During the quarter, we announced our 2020 Vision capital allocation plan, a revised comprehensive long-term capital allocation plan designed to maintain investment-grade credit metrics through cycles, further return capital to shareholders over time and continue to invest in accretive organic growth. The plan envisions $20 billion of available cash through 2026 and over $20 per share of run rate distributable cash flow. Zach will review some of the key features of the plan in a few minutes. But we believe our new 2020 vision is an excellent capital allocation framework for our stakeholders and the plan follows our significantly accelerated execution under the long-term capital allocation plan we implemented just over a year ago.  Before moving on, I also want to highlight important organizational announcement I made during the quarter. Organizational clarity and operational excellence are 2 of my key priorities. And as Cheniere has grown and evolved, so too must our organization in order to maintain an incredibly high operating standard we have set for ourselves. In September, we announced the promotion of Corey Grindal, currently Executive Vice President of Worldwide Trading in London, to serve as Cheniere's inaugural Chief Operating Officer, effective January 2023. Corey has been at Cheniere for nearly a decade, and his leadership and contributions have been an integral part of building the exceptional operating platform we enjoy today. Prior to his role, overseeing Worldwide Trading in London, Corey was SVP of Gas Supply and was the architect behind Cheniere's gas procurement program, which today is one of the largest holders of pipeline capacity and purchasers of natural gas in the United States. We look forward to Corey's continued leadership as COO, building upon our safety-first culture and reputation as a leading reliable supplier of LNG in the world. I'm pleased to welcome Corey back to Houston in his elevated role as COO. You all will begin to hear from Corey directly as he participates in investor conferences and these earnings calls next year.  Turn now to Slide 6. I'll give you a brief update on construction and execution across our Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi sites. First, last week, commissioning was completed for the third marine berth at Sabine Pass. And consistent with our track record, the third berth achieved substantial completion ahead of the guaranteed schedule and within project budgets. The third berth will not only provide increased flexibility to our marine loading operations, particularly during suboptimal conditions like fog events, but also serves as a brownfield infrastructure that we can economically leverage as we develop our expansion plans at Sabine Pass.  Now moving to Corpus Christi Stage 3. As I mentioned before, we are off and running and the project is making excellent progress. Inclusive of the early limited notice to proceed we utilized at the start of the year, we've invested approximately $1 billion to date of Stage 3. The LNTP not only provided cost benefits, enabling us to lock in prices early, but also provided some significant construction schedule advantages with early site work, such as [indiscernible]. Long lead time equipment orders have been placed with suppliers, and key equipment manufacturing is expected to start before year-end.  We recently held a groundbreaking ceremony at the Stage 3 site, and it was exciting to see such overwhelming support for the project across a broad spectrum of stakeholders who help make the project possible from regulators, government officials, to long-term customers, EPC and equipment providers, banks and, of course, our employees. As we work towards first LNG from Stage 3 in late 2025, I look forward to upholding Cheniere's stellar reputation on safety and execution and partnership with Bechtel.  Thank you all again for your continued support of Cheniere. I'll now turn the call over to Anatol, who will provide an update on the LNG market.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8. Despite it being a shoulder season in many regions, the turbulence in the global gas and LNG markets continued throughout the third quarter with only a few brief stretches of [indiscernible]. While geopolitical conflicts and the related curtailment of Russian gas flows are largely responsible for supply shock in Europe this year, we believe that some cyclical dynamics also played a role in laying the groundwork for today's market conditions of elevated prices and volatility. In fact, we've signaled for some time that the rate of new liquefaction capacity coming online would decelerate significantly during the 2020 through 2024 period, given the lack of FIDs taken in the years prior. As you can see on the chart to the left, we estimate current capacity growth rates to be near 2%, a level not seen since 2012 when the market was also out of balance and prices clearly signaled the need for new LNG capacity. As a result, given the long lead time required to develop LNG projects, we expect market balances to potentially remain tight for the next several years, exacerbated by the crisis in Europe and the reduction of Russian supply to the European market.  As shown in the middle chart, LNG imports from the U.S. have been the primary resource to offset the removal of over 50 Bcm of Russian gas imports from the European market this year, further reinforcing Jack's earlier point on the ability of U.S. LNG to respond quickly to market signals. As the primary source of global LNG supply growth for the past 4 years, the U.S. has surpassed Australia and Qatar to become the world's largest supplier measured by installed capacity this year, and this growth could not have come at a more critical time for Europe, given that inherent destination flexibility.  The U.S. has become Europe's top LNG supplier, and Cheniere's facilities at Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi have been significant contributors to this growth, helping provide secure and reliable natural gas supply to the European market, which I will detail further in a minute.  Despite the steady increase in LNG flows to Europe, TTF continued to rally in the third quarter, hitting an all-time high of about $99 per MMBtu in late August, as concerns surrounding adequacy of supply reached new levels. Since then, TTF prices have come off considerably, settling in October at about $54 in MMBtu, despite no sign of Nord Stream flows resuming. JKM [indiscernible] have traded at a discount to TTF for much of this year as European buyers have kept netbacks higher into the region compared to Asia in order to fill storage ahead of winter heating demand. In the U.S. Henry Hub prices have generally dropped since late August, settling in October at $6.87 in MMBtu as temperatures and forecasts moderated and gas production continued to rise.  Let's now turn to Page 9 to address regional dynamics in more detail. As I just mentioned, Europe has been utilizing LNG to try to offset as much of its gas supply deficit related to the Russian gas cuts by increasing its LNG imports by 65% this year with approximately 87 million tons imported through the third quarter, making 2022 an all-time high year for LNG imports into Europe. Imports from the U.S. represented 44% of that total. In fact, Cheniere alone was responsible for approximately 1/4 of Europe's LNG imports this year. As the top middle chart illustrates, U.S. LNG volumes surged over 200% year-on-year in the third quarter as Nord Stream flows came to a halt by the end of the quarter.  Nevertheless, the European market appears well prepared for winter as shown with storage levels exceeding their 5-year average on the back of milder weather, some level of industrial demand management and aggressive buying by European utilities. As such, we have recently seen prices moderate as the market waits for winter demand to kick in. We've also seen the congestion at certain European regas terminals continue to grow, once again, evidencing the need for development of additional import capacity and related infrastructure in order to provide relief and allow greater volumes of LNG to access the market, particularly in Northwest Europe.  Fortunately, the new Eemshaven import terminal in the Netherlands recently began operations. The terminal, one of the few FSRUs is expected to start in Europe in the coming months, received its first cargo in September, which was produced and delivered from our facility at Sabine Pass. In Asia, LNG imports declined by 14.5 million tons year-to-date with nearly 5 million tons of the decline realized in the third quarter. 90% of this decline is attributable to China as a result of reduced industrial sector demand and weak gas burn, which could remain a trend throughout this winter.  In China, industrial gas demand decreased by 3 Bcm in the third quarter, representing an 8.7% drop year-on-year, and low hydro levels supported thermal use in power generation with coal generation increasing by 11% year-on-year in the third quarter, while gas grew only 4%. However, overall gas-fired power generation dropped 8% year-on-year from January through September as high spot LNG prices and robust renewables generation in the first half of the year disincentivized domestic use and actually encouraged cargoes to be redirected to Europe. Much of the demand growth in Asia in the third quarter occurred in Thailand, Japan and Taiwan as a result of inelastic consumption needs.  As we mentioned in previous calls, Thailand continues to call on LNG to supplement dwindling domestic gas production. Japan plugged a 2.7-gigawatt deficit in nuclear availability in the third quarter and Taiwan continues to offset the decline in coal generation.  Let's move to Slide 10. Last quarter, we discussed LNG contracting trends and the growing commercial success that U.S. projects were garnering. That contracting momentum continued in the third quarter, reaching a total of 40 million tons per annum of long-term transactions signed with U.S. projects year-to-date that's through mid-October, highlighted by our long-term deals with PetroChina and PTT. As you can see on the left chart, the aggregate volume is approximately 80% higher than what was signed in all of 2021 and represents more than 75% of global contracts signed year-to-date. In fact, the first 9 months of 2022 alone make '22 a record year for U.S. LNG contracts signed. This commercial success is owed largely to several key advantages of U.S. LNG, destination flexibility, competitive and stable pricing, a mature upstream and midstream footprint and time to market. These advantages, coupled with elevated market prices, have provided tailwinds for the development of additional LNG capacity in the U.S. However, most of those U.S. projects still have yet to make FID given the rigorous commercial, financial, regulatory and technical hurdles, projects are required to overcome in order to raise financing and move forward with construction. And those hurdles are only getting higher given the volatility, inflation and rising interest rates.  For our part, as we discussed last month, we plan to continue to pursue growth of our 55 million-ton platform, starting with our near-term plans to add approximately 5 million tons per annum via the CCL Trains 8 and 9 mid-scale project and some debottlenecking at Stage 3 along with the long-term potential to add an incremental 30 million tons per annum of volume across our 2 sites. Volume that will continue to ensure security supply and sustainable economic growth for our long-term customers and end-use communities. We're hard at work on these opportunities, and we'll keep you informed on them as they achieve project development milestones.  And now I'll turn the call over to Zach to review our financial results and guidance.\nZach Davis: Thanks, Anatol, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our third quarter 2022 financial results and key financial accomplishments, all of which continue to reflect our team's tireless efforts to ensure safe and reliable operations and seamless execution throughout this period of prolonged volatility in the global energy markets.  Turning to Slide 12. During the third quarter, we generated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.8 billion, distributable cash flow of approximately $2 billion and a net loss of approximately $2.4 billion. Our third quarter results once again were supported by the sustained higher margin environment across global gas and LNG markets. Higher lifting margins due to higher Henry Hub prices across the quarter, and incremental margin achieved from certain portfolio optimization activities. Our quarterly results were achieved despite a couple of CMI cargoes moving into Q4 from Q3. In addition, in the third quarter, we recognized a portion of the payment from Chevron related to the early termination of the regasification TUA, which we expect to receive before year-end. We recognized [indiscernible] 560 TBtu of physical LNG during the third quarter, including 556 TBtu produced from our Sabine Pass or Corpus Christi projects and 4 TBtu sourced from third parties. Approximately 82% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SPA or IPM agreements with terms greater than 10 years.  Once again, the net income line continues to be impacted by the unrealized noncash derivative impact related to our long-term IPM agreements, as we have discussed on prior earnings calls. In the third quarter, we recognized $4.9 billion of these unrealized noncash [indiscernible] losses attributable to the continued growth of LNG margins and commodity price volatility. As a reminder, because GAAP requires mark-to-market accounting of these long-term gas supply agreements, but does not permit the mark-to-market of the associated and offsetting sale of LNG, it results in a mismatch of accounting methodology for the purchase of natural gas and the corresponding sale of LNG, which drives this quarterly variability in net income from period to period. That is why we would expect as margins stabilize and price volatility subsides over time that these unrealized noncash derivative moves will become much less pronounced in our quarterly results.  Thanks in large part to the significantly accelerated progress on our capital allocation plan announced in September of 2021. During the quarter, we rolled out our revised long-term capital allocation plan. Our 2020 vision of over $20 billion of available cash through 2026 as well as over $20 per share of run rate distributable cash flow. Built upon the foundation of our previous plan, this plan is designed to achieve and maintain investment-grade metrics through cycles, further return capital to shareholders over time and continue to invest in accretive growth beyond Corpus Christi Stage 3. As part of the revised plan, we increased our share repurchase authorization by $4 billion for an additional 3 years, beginning October 1, 2022. Lowered our consolidated long-term leverage target to approximately 4x and increased the dividend by 20% beginning in the third quarter of 2022, targeting a 10% annual dividend growth rate through the construction of Stage 3 into the mid-2020. Our accelerated progress in terms of capital allocation, coupled with our revised plan demonstrates the power of the Cheniere platform through market cycles and solidifies nearest position as a leading global LNG operator and a preeminent North American infrastructure company.  During the quarter, we repaid over $1.3 billion of consolidated long-term indebtedness, bringing our total debt pay down to over $4.4 billion through the third quarter since launching our capital allocation plan last year. And in the first 9 months of this year, we have repaid over $3.2 billion of debt. Just in the third quarter alone, we prepaid nearly $800 million of outstanding borrowings on the CCH term loan facility. And notably, we repurchased over $530 million in principle of senior notes at both CEI and CCH at price levels under par under an open market repurchase program that was initiated during the quarter.  This past month, we have also redeemed $300 million of the 2023 senior secured notes at SBL, pursuant to an early redemption notice issued in September. We are clearly demonstrating our commitment to our balance sheet by utilizing multiple avenues to efficiently reach those target leverage metrics, and we will continue to be opportunistic as we optimize the debt across the Cheniere complex to achieve resilient and sustainable investment-grade credit metrics.  Our accelerated deleveraging efforts towards an investment-grade consolidated balance sheet have been reflected in ratings upgrades by multiple agencies recently. In September, Moody's upgraded CEI 2 notches to Ba1 and CQP and SBL 1 notch to Ba1 and Baa2, bringing all S&P and Moody's ratings in sync across the Cheniere complex. Also in September, Fitch upgraded CQP to BBB- and SBL to BBB+. Fitch's upgrade of CQP to BBB- is significant as Americas the first-ever unsecured investment-grade rating at one of our corporate parent entities, and it's an important milestone in Cheniere's continued evolution.  We will continue to execute on our 2020 Vision plan and expect further positive ratings momentum and migration to investment grade over time.  In terms of shareholder returns, during the third quarter, we repurchased over 0.5 million shares for approximately $75 million, bringing our total shares repurchased to approximately 5 million shares for a little over $600 million. The upside share repurchase authorization we announced as part of our new capital allocation plan didn't commence until the fourth quarter. And I can tell you we are off and running under the new authorization, having already repurchased over 1 million shares just in October as we have now recalibrated our debt paydown to share repurchase ratio through 2026 on a long-term cumulative basis from 4:1 to 1:1 to further enhance shareholder returns while further solidifying our long-term investment-grade credit metrics.  During the third quarter, we also declared and paid our fourth quarterly dividend of $0.33 per common share, bringing our total dividends paid to $1.32 per common share. Under our new capital allocation plan, we increased the dividend by 20% for the dividend related to the third quarter to $0.395 per common share and maintain our commitment to increasing the dividend by approximately 10% per year through Stage 3 construction, which will grow us into around a 20% payout ratio over time.  Turn now to Slide 13, where I'll provide additional detail on our guidance and our open capacity for the remainder of the 2022 as well as for 2023. We are reconfirming our full year 2022 guidance ranges of $11 billion to $11.5 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $8.1 billion to $8.6 billion in distributable cash flow. These ranges were each already increased by approximately $1.2 billion since our last earnings call in September, and we can now highlight that we are currently tracking into the upper half of both ranges as well as to the high end of our CQP distribution guidance of $4 to $4.25 per unit. Our guidance ranges illustrate what an incredible year 2022 has been for Cheniere. Since our initial guidance ranges for 2022 were provided 12 months ago, we have increased the midpoint of our EBITDA range by approximately 85%, DCF by approximately 150% and CQP distribution by approximately 1/3. With respect to the EBITDA sensitivity for the remainder of 2022, we are approaching the end of the year, and therefore, we have sold much of our total expected production for the remainder of the year and have approximately 20 TBtu unsold remaining. We currently forecast that a $1 change in market margin would impact EBITDA by approximately $20 million the balance of 2022 as we have released the remaining volume that had been reserved for long-term origination back to C&I. Our results could also be impacted by those year-end cargoes we mentioned back on our call in September. With the volatility and evolving market dynamics, these cargoes could be drawn to Asia, which would push the timing of recognition of some of these cargoes into 2023.  With that being said, as we look to 2023 and our sensitivity to market margin, currently, we forecast approximately 150 TBtu of open volumes in 2023 and we expect a $1 change in market margin to impact 2023 EBITDA by approximately $130 million as a portion of our forecasted unsold volume for next year is being reserved for potential long-term origination negotiations. We do have some term contracts commencing over the course of the year. There is likely a slight weighting of that open volume to the first half of the year.  In terms of major capital expenditures, I would mainly highlight we forecast spending approximately $1.5 billion in CapEx related to Corpus Christi Stage 3 in 2023, which is a similar amount to what we expect to have funded this year, including our LNTP payments since the start of 2022. As we mentioned in September, we will provide our full year EBITDA, DCF and CQP distribution guidance ranges for 2023 on the fourth quarter call in February. Our unsold position in 2023 is expected to be lower than 2022 as 2022 benefited from the early completion and ramp-up of Train 6 and the maintenance optimization we disclosed in May. Certain long-term contracts are scheduled to commence over the course of 2023, and we have [indiscernible] planned maintenance scheduled for the next year at Sabine. Without a new train coming into service next year, we wouldn't expect a material change to the production forecast from here.  The current state of global gas markets, which have featured elevated market margins for nearly a year now, underscore the global call for meaningful investment in natural gas infrastructure, which Cheniere is leading with our recent sanctioning of Corpus Christi Stage 3. During this prolonged period of heightened volatility, we've been deliberate and prudent stewards of capital, accelerating progress on our capital allocation objectives and positioning Cheniere for resilient success in the decades to come. And we expect to lead with a sustainable investment-grade balance sheet, accretive growth projects and meaningful and growing shareholder returns.  That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Lapides: Just real quickly, can you talk, Jack, a little bit about time line. You hinted at it a little bit for Stage 3 in terms of potentially being able to move things forward a little bit, how much, how material? And then can you talk about the maintenance at Sabine Pass in 2023? I assume it's probably more shoulder month, but let me know if that's wrong. And how should we -- is there a way to quantify the impact on volume?\nJack Fusco: Michael, thanks. So first, on construction in Stage 3, I'm extremely pleased at the progress to date. You can tell from my talking points that I perfectly expect my staff and Bechtel to have underpromise and overdeliver on my expectations. And -- it's a little early at this point for us to revise our schedule. But I would stay tuned if we continue to have this favorable weather and we continue to execute the way the plant has developed.  As far as maintenance, you're right, we try to do maintenance in the shoulder months where LNG prices typically are lowest. It's a 6-year cycle at Sabine. So it's an unusual year for us where we have 2 trains coming down basically at the same time to do maintenance on them. As far as quantities of the maintenance, I'll turn it over to Zach and he can give you more detail on that part of it.\nZach Davis: Michael, as we think about '22 versus '23, we're going to be slightly up year-over-year on total production and that's really mainly due to the Train 6. We had about 11 months of production hitting P&L last -- this year with a little ramp-up in Q1. We have a full year of Train 6 for '23. But that will be offset a bit by this major maintenance that is definitively planned for next year. So basically, I'd say we are probably rounding down to 44 million tons for the year this year, and we'll be right around 45 million tons where the rest of the 7 trains are not -- that won't have the maintenance, we'll pick up the slack to an extent.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: So just wanted to go back, Zach, to your comments on CapEx in '23. So you flagged the Corpus Christi Stage 3 spending. So that's clear. Anything else you flagged major? I know you talked in the past about prep work on Midscale 8 and 9. So I just wanted to see if there are any other major items.\nZach Davis: That's about it, Michael. I mean the $1.5 billion is the, let's say, all-in levered costs that we would deploy next year. And honestly, that's kind of what we expect this year. We've spent about $1 billion already pre-FID and post-FID and have another $400 million to $500 million to go this quarter as we're like 12% progressed at Stage 3. On other CapEx, we're going to be spending money, let's say, hundreds of millions of dollars across the board on things to continue to optimize, but also develop at Corpus and Sabine. And you're just not going to notice it as clearly, we'll have billing into DCF next year when we come out with it officially in February.\nMichael Blum: Okay. Got it. That makes sense. And then I just wanted to ask kind of between your debt and equity allocation decisions quarter-by-quarter, third quarter buybacks are a little bit lower, debt purchase was higher. Clearly, buybacks are picked up in Q4. Just trying to see if there's any patterns we should be aware of or what's behind the decision process there?\nZach Davis: Sure. So clearly, you could see in Q2, we bought back over $500 million of stock during that June period, specifically [Technical Difficulty] the stock had a little pressure on it, and we were opportunistic. And then if you just look at Q3 from to , the stock went up like $35. So you can imagine, as the stock is going up, we're obviously being less opportunistic. But when things are a little bit more stagnant or obviously, there's pressure on the stock, we're hitting it harder. And then another -- the other thing I'd add is we clearly had to wait till the announcement on capital allocation in mid-September, just with all the [indiscernible] that came with that to officially set up the 10b5-1 for Q4. And that's why the new plan with the upside allocation started in earnest in Q4, and we've already bought back over 1 million shares just in October.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: I just want to kind of reconcile against the last update that we heard from you guys. A bit over a month ago with the September update, you gave guidance. And since then, spreads came in and Europe faced logistical issues, you now point to the high end of the EBITDA guide. Just wondering what positives materialized and will they carry into '23?\nZach Davis: Jeremy, it's Zach. So a few things materialized for us in terms of -- I think there was an extra cargo at Corpus. Optimization, I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we had higher subchartering revenue as we really position the whole portfolio going into the winter and with elevated pricings on shipping, that added some money. And then we obviously were a little proactive on selling into the market even in September before the market came down a bit and now it is now just over $10 for the rest of the year. And that was offset a bit even by some crossover cargoes that we've pushed out again into '23. They're moving back and forth depending on whether they're going to hit Europe or Asia. So it only took a few hundred million there. And that's not to mention we released those final origination cargoes. We pretty much rolled those over into 2023 to keep that in the arsenal for the long-term origination team. But with all that, yes, we feel pretty good we'll be in the upper half of the guidance range.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Makes sense. I bet a little Cheniere conservatism was baked in there as well. So always good to see that. And just kind of continuing with this, we -- these European logistics issues carrying forward into 2023, just wondering if you see that kind of impacting your outlook now? And also just broadly macro question here, if Russia is sending much less gas into Europe in '23. How do you think Europe [indiscernible] next year?\nAnatol Feygin: Jeremy, it's Anatol. Thanks for the question. The good news on the Europe front is it is moving very aggressively to resolve these infrastructure issues. We spoke about our honor to inaugurate Eemshaven. That facility will double. We do expect that throughout '23, about 60 million tons of additional regas capacity will be added. That number will probably get over 70 million tons in '24. But we agree with you, we think Europe is in no way out of the woods without that pipeline flow. It is really -- for most of this year, it is next winter that we were more worried about because, obviously, this winter did have the benefit of a substantial amount of flow even in the first half of this year before Nord Stream was fully shut off. So it will be a challenge. The infrastructure issues will be addressed over the next really 6 to 12 months. You've already seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of floating storage in Europe, and we think that, that was a little bit of weather and this additional infrastructure solutions will get cleaned up quickly. But the molecules for Europe will be very difficult to come by over the coming years.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. So just to be clear on that last point, you're seeing the winter fill next year looks like it could be as tight as it was this year?\nAnatol Feygin: Weather-dependent, of course, as always, but entirely possible that it will be more difficult to reach these 80-plus percent full storage levels.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Marc Solecitto with Barclays.\nMarc Solecitto: In terms of the liquefaction fee environment and the marginal cost of new supply, it wasn't too long ago where it seemed like the industry might have been trending towards the lower half of that 2 to 2.50 CMI margin assumption range? So just wondering with interest rates now at the highest they've been at in over 15 years and EPC costs trending higher, where do you see the marginal cost of new supply and liquefaction fees trending today?\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Thanks, Marc. Anatol again. We expect that trend to play out. But I have to tell you kind of in the trenches, you haven't seen much of that. There are -- the competition among U.S. developers is still one that is anchoring expectations, buyer expectations in that low end of the range. I will say that it has been coming up somewhat, but in the aggregate between these aggressively priced offtake deals by some of the early-stage developers as well as the EPC inflationary pressures and the interest rate environment, that's a tough equation to solve, and we think that that's, of course, part of the reason why you haven't seen more projects [indiscernible]. Zach, do you want to add some thoughts on inflation?\nZach Davis: Sure. So just to acknowledge the inflation out there that's clearly happening for everybody, and we think about our operating expenses or even our SG&A, our SPAs, which we have over 30 of with different counterparties all over the world, they all have a built-in annual escalator based on CPI for, let's say, approximately, give or take, 15%. And if you just bake that in and with how much we have in fixed fees, going into the new year, we're more than covering any inflation on O&M and SG&A for the company, which just highlights the stability of that run rate cash flow.\nMarc Solecitto: Got it. That's very helpful. And then as it relates to the 150 TBT open for next year, have you started to lock in some of your open exposure for 2023? And would that be included in that reference open capacity number?\nZach Davis: Yes. So what we acknowledged in the prepared remarks and in the presentation is we actually have 150 TBtu truly open. And of that, we're reserving 20 TBtu for origination placeholders, so that $130 million, give or take, for a $1 move in margin, that's open today. However, I'd say we have probably sold onward and locked in fixed margins for around 20 TBtu for 2023 at this point. Clearly, the liquidity is pretty tough with how volatile it's been. But we're making a dent there and we'll give an even more robust update next year.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jean Salisbury with Bernstein.\nJean Salisbury: Anatol, I wanted to get your view on the medium-term LNG market. Obviously, some large moving pieces and whether more U.S. projects go forward and whether Russian gas keeps [indiscernible], but seeing everything that you can see now, do you think it's more likely that LNG will be overbuilt or underbuilt in the back half of the decade?\nAnatol Feygin: I really don't see this overbuild dynamic even in that '26, '27, '28 time frame. There's such an enormous amount of latent demand, if you will. We've been shying away from the term of demand destruction, right? We've termed a demand management. Even as prices pulled back in Europe modestly over the last 1 month, 1.5 months, you've seen a fairly dramatic resumption in industrial demand, right? So those numbers don't go away for a very long time. And yes, BASF and others may build facilities in the U.S. and in Qatar, but fundamentally, the demand picture in Europe just isn't going to change that much. And we still see a tremendous demand growth story out of Asia and EM in general. So we, of course, as you know, fully believe that the Qatari mega trades will continue to come on, the 4 under construction now, plus 2 more plus 2 more. There just aren't enough solutions and now with this very robust contracting, but relatively slow process to FID U.S. projects, that's just going to make the market that much tighter through the back half of this decade. So we see years and years of this dynamic before you can see a truly balanced market.\nJack Fusco: Jean, this is Jack. I always track how much capital is being invested in natural gas infrastructure around the world, and there's over $1 trillion right now of nat gas projects around the world with pipelines and power plants in regas facilities. So that, to me, is a signal that gas is here, it's here to stay for the long term and that the LNG side of it will continue to grow.\nJean Salisbury: Great. That's -- I appreciate all that. As a follow-up, I'm just wondering what the waiting time for a new LNG FERC filing is these days? I think earlier this year, you kind of estimated 2 years but said maybe if the U.S. focused on it, it could be a lot faster than that. So I'm wondering if 2 years is still a good number or faster than that or possibly slower than that?\nJack Fusco: Yes. No, Jean, I'll tell you, over the last 6 years, we've doubled our business here at Cheniere. And today, more than ever, that permitting strategy, I believe, is essential, right, because it's more and more difficult with the current regulatory environment to make any mid-course changes, whether they're on design or construction. So we filed -- we prefiled for Midscale Trains 8, 9 that got accepted not too long ago. There's a 6-month period after prefiling that we need to wait. It's our expectation that we will file immediately thereafter, so early next year with 8, 9 and then -- and hopefully, my goal is to make those trains contiguous. So right after Train 7 is commissioned, I want to go to Train 8 and then to Train 9. So we're trying to move quickly. I think that's just strategically the whole permitting strategy part and making sure that you've crossed the t's and dotted the i's and your application is more important [indiscernible].\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brian Reynolds with UBS.\nBrian Reynolds: Maybe just a follow-up to Jean Ann's question on the FERC permitting process. Any insights on to whether we could see further growth at Corpus or Sabine? Are there any signposts that we should be looking for in terms of preference? And when should we expect maybe a pre-FERC filing process to begin there?\nJack Fusco: No, look, you know from our talking points that and Anatol's talking point that we're looking at 30-plus MTPA of growth across the portfolio. I would expect Sabine to be first. I'd expect sometime next year that we do a prefiling for additional growth there at Sabine. But again, like I said, we're making sure that we understand everything it is to know about that growth and that, that filing is complete, so it gets accepted and moved through the process appropriately. And then right after that, hopefully, Trains 8 and 9 will be done at Corpus, and we can focus on whatever additional expansion plans we have there.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. That's super helpful. Maybe as a follow-up, the ability to sell cargoes forward in the market, the times seem shorter and shorter relative to years past just given pricing and liquidity. Can you just talk about how that market is now? Is it improving in terms of being able to sell those cargoes forward? And could you be in a situation middle of next year going into the tight winter that was alluded to earlier, to where you'll be selling those cargoes basically at spot prices at that time?\nZach Davis: Sure. So this is Zach. And I have mentioned this previously on calls, but it's just a totally different world than it was, let's say, 18 to 24 months ago, where you could lock in a cargo and maybe tie up capital for, I don't know, $10 million, $15 million, $20 million. We're tying up cargoes now into the end of the year, and that potentially requires us to reserve capital of almost $200 million. And we start talking about tying up cargoes financially into next year or a quarter plus away. That's over $0.5 billion still. So the volatility is just so elevated and even with, I guess, a drop in LNG prices to an extent even though we're still talking about $10-plus this year, $20-plus next year and onward, it just doesn't make it too tenable to handle 130 TBtu that are open for us. So what the CMI team has done tremendously well this year and is already doing as we speak, is selling physical cargoes on a fixed price basis or even on a Henry Hub plus basis. And that's how we've been able to give you these guidance updates with confidence, even though there's been just so much volatility. So for the time being, yes, we don't see financially hedging as a large tool for the company, but it will be a tool. I mean you see there's still margin deposits on the balance sheet of over $200 million for the quarter. So we're using it, but we're being quite selective.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Just to come back to try to quantify some of this. In terms of improving returns, just if only simply because of the higher rate environment, can you try to speak to that a little bit more in terms of what you're prospectively seeing in your counterparty conversations? Again, I know that Anatol, you try to provide some context in terms of the offtake prices themselves, but maybe reframe that in terms of returns, if you can elaborate on that initially and maybe speak a little bit to the pace of contracting? Obviously, you've retained a certain portion in '23, but what are you seeing in terms of your own commitment pace next year as well?\nZach Davis: All right. This is Zach. I'm going to try to answer some of that and then I'll hand it off to Anatol. But basically, what a lot of these folks are experiencing as they try to FID really don't pertain to us today. I mean we started locking in our costs earlier this year, and then we have a lump sum turnkey contract where I can still say to you that -- we're building Stage 3 at 6x CapEx to EBITDA, and it's under a lump sum turnkey contract with Bechtel and we have hundreds of millions of dollars of contingency that were baked into that cost that we haven't touched. So we feel very good that we were able to be competitive in our to range for long-term contracts, and we're going to make double-digit unlevered returns on Stage 3. We're in the process of permitting Trains 8 and 9 on top of that. Obviously, they're going to be incredibly cost-effective considering we're not using [indiscernible] to expand there. And we'll see where those prices shake out. But we think it's going to be extremely competitive, and we'll be able to offer a really competitive price out there without elevating prices all that much, if at all. I'll hand it off to Anatol though.\nAnatol Feygin: Yes, Julien. So we felt comfortable with this to range. As you heard some of the previous Q&A, I mean the market overall for U.S. projects has firmed up a bit, but it is still very much anchored in those early-stage developer proposals. We've always felt like we extract a premium for the operational excellence and the performance that we now have a track record of. We don't participate in the race to the bottom, and we have a lot of components to our contractual agreements like the inflation mechanism that Zach spoke to earlier that are heavily negotiated, and we think will stand the test of time much better than most of the other proposals that are in the market. So we're still very comfortable with the returns responsible for the top line of that Zach equation. I think we can continue to deliver those types of economics. And yes, we [indiscernible] with this brownfield advantage and operational excellence and cargoes that are incrementally available from debottlenecking as part of that commercial value proposition, but the numbers that we're giving you today, we still feel very good and strong about.\nZach Davis: And it's nice to add that we're not really issuing debt all that much these days. We're just paying down billions of dollars a day. So we're just in a different world than we would have been 10 years ago in a rising rate environment.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Totally. Understood, right. It sounds like return disclosure that you guys are writing are largely unchanged albeit elevated nonetheless. If I can, just to come back and clarify from earlier on prefiling, should we expect a regular cadence as you think about the -- your regular deployment of new liquefaction out in the decade? As you alluded to a moment ago, you would expect next year some prefiling. Should we expect them to sort of overlap in a similar and regular cadence way? Or do you think that because you say you need to dot your i's and t's that you can't have as much of an overlap. I know that was a little bit of a thought earlier. But just coming back to clarify that.\nJack Fusco: So I think, Julien, you should expect some overlap between the 2 sites. We're not going to have overlap on 1 site.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ben Nolan with Stifel.\nBenjamin Nolan: I'm surprised that nobody has mentioned this yet, but how about Cristian Javier and those Astros yesterday, my goodness.\nJack Fusco: Thank you for mentioning that because the night before was a bad night and last night made up for. So we're very excited to have him come back home and bring home the World Series right here in Houston.\nBenjamin Nolan: Absolutely. I'm with you. So my 2 quick questions here is, first of all, I'm curious where you stand as it relates to LNG shipping. Obviously, we've seen the shipping rates just explode here recently, and I know a lot of what you do is fully contracted, but maybe just any update on sort of how you're positioned in that respect.\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Thanks, Ben. We operate a long-term business that has long-term commitments and lots of flexibility within that. We learned our lessons really before we started in the market and are not in a position to risk being short-shipping. So we're well protected. Our delivered contracts and our producer contracts have a lot of optionality embedded in them that are paid for by our customers, and we take advantage of that, as Zach mentioned earlier, in some of the optimization opportunities we've experienced over this year. So we're in good shape and the market give us on that side at the moment.\nZach Davis: Yes. I'll just add. I mean at this point, we're basically the second largest charter of ships in the world. And we've been proactive on this as we sign up the [indiscernible] deals or IPM deals. We're typically almost simultaneously locking in long-term charters. So going into this winter, even going into this year, we've had a large portfolio that's well under $100,000 a day when prices have been doubled, tripled, sometimes quadrupled or more. So that's been part of the tailwinds to EBITDA this year and even part of how we got to the upper end of the guidance range at this point in just the last month is some of the subchartering that we've been able to do as we haven't used all our ships to get to Asia, but are directing them towards Europe.\nBenjamin Nolan: That's great color. I appreciate that, Zach. And then as my follow-up, it's interesting to hear you guys talk about sort of beyond the next phase of Corpus Christi and looking to potentially do something at Sabine Pass. I'm curious how you're thinking about the way that's done? Obviously, here lately, you're doing the Midscale versions. Is that just because they happen to be a good fit for where -- what you're trying to do is Stage 3? Or are you thinking that whatever the Midscale model is probably the way that you're going to be moving forward with all your incremental development going forward?\nJack Fusco: No. We're looking at all the technologies. So we're looking at gas compression. We're looking at large electric compression. We're looking at Midscale electric compression. So we're doing a complete evaluation. I like the Midscale solution for Stage 3. It helped control the inflationary pressures that we see on the large trains with a lot of [indiscernible] nickel and precious metals. But it doesn't mean that's where we're going to stay for the rest of the portfolio. So we'll develop a solution that is appropriate for the site.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Alex Kania with Wolfe Research.\nAlexis Kania: Just can you talk a little bit more maybe just about the broader landscape of these partially contracted LNG projects? Do you think that, ultimately, that a fair amount of those may not end up moving forward? And if so, do those kind of represent commercial opportunities for you to kind of discuss kind of contracting with some of these parties that are already on board, some projects that may end up not moving forward?\nAnatol Feygin: Yes, Alex. This is Anatol. I'll try that first and see if anyone else wants to chime in. But look, we -- with the loss of Arctic Russia as a major supply [indiscernible] to meet the LNG demand, U.S. was the next logical choice. You saw this rush to contract 40 million tons year-to-date and 30 million of that has yet to be performed on. And like with all of these -- there isn't a simple answer for these questions anymore as the market becomes large, diverse, has multiple participants. There are a lot of load serving entities in that 30 million tons that need the LNG, and there are a lot of opportunistic buyers in those 30 million tons that are just out there to see what can possibly get over the finish line and offer the kind of attractive economics that were too good to pass up. So there's some of each. We certainly think that we're in a great position to continue to grow our platform, do it judiciously and potentially benefit from some of the buyers that really need the supply over the coming years.\nAlexis Kania: Great. Then maybe just a follow up on the rating agencies. I mean I know they've had some time to digest the capital allocation plan that they've had already some rating updates. Do you kind of have the sense though, broadly about how maybe that trend towards the investment-grade goal may look heading into next year or so? Just getting a sense of the rating agencies -- what else the rating agencies need to get you kind of uniformly into the BBB range?\nZach Davis: Sure. This is Zach again. And I'll just say we feel quite confident that our balance sheet strategy has been validated even recently. With the momentum on the ratings, upgrades, finally starting to catch up to the momentum on the debt paydown on the credit metrics that are at this point under 3x even on an LTM basis. But I guess how I'll put it is we're on the -- in the spirit of the Astros being in the World Series and then they hit last night, we're in the home stretch on getting [indiscernible]. And basically, the game plan is we're going to inundate or overwhelm them with a little more debt paydown and EBITDA growth. And yes, it's just going to be too evident when you add on to that the execution from operations and construction and just the contracts. I mean we have over 30 counterparties, average rating, remaining life of the contracts is 17 years for over 90% of our capacity. So when you add all that up, yes, we're pretty confident we're going to get there by the first half of 2023, if not sooner. And yes, seeing all the agencies provide upgrades already this year, we're just getting started there.\nOperator: We'll take our last question from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.\nCraig Shere: Just kind of picking up a little on the last question about contracting. Note that long-term SPAs from perspective in actual U.S. projects kind of materially trailed off the last couple months. Given that brief hiatus, I wonder, Anatol, if you can opine on your confidence that the Europeans will step up to the table again into the first half of next year? And if you could give us a sense to the degree you think Cheniere is being shortlisted by the Europeans on prospective new long-term commitments due to a combination of your bridging cargoes, a desire to reward those who helped this year and a desire to work with partners that can make clean energy investments in the medium and long term in CCUS and hydrogen a priority?\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Craig, for the leading question. If I ever gave you the impression that we feel confident that there will be an armada of European load serving utilities as counterparties, I misspoke. I think that those will be few and far between. We, of course, have done the transactions with Equinor and Engie, as you know, this year, and we are optimistic that European-based buyers will be part of the portfolio and part of the solution going forward. But we do see the Asian market as the primary growth driver and the primary long-term contracting opportunity. Year-to-date, there have been freshest view, I think, what you would call European buyers that have come to the table. You'll see them here and there. We're obviously in those discussions. As you said, we bring a lot to the table, but they are fewer and far between. And even though we have been a critical part of rebalancing Europe last year and this year and we'll continue to do our best to support its efforts to meet its energy demands, we don't expect a lot of load serving European utilities to be in that 30-plus counterparty list going forward.\nJack Fusco: Thanks, everybody. Thanks for your support of Cheniere.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Anatol Feygin",
            "content": "Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8. Despite it being a shoulder season in many regions, the turbulence in the global gas and LNG markets continued throughout the third quarter with only a few brief stretches of [indiscernible]. While geopolitical conflicts and the related curtailment of Russian gas flows are largely responsible for supply shock in Europe this year, we believe that some cyclical dynamics also played a role in laying the groundwork for today's market conditions of elevated prices and volatility. In fact, we've signaled for some time that the rate of new liquefaction capacity coming online would decelerate significantly during the 2020 through 2024 period, given the lack of FIDs taken in the years prior. As you can see on the chart to the left, we estimate current capacity growth rates to be near 2%, a level not seen since 2012 when the market was also out of balance and prices clearly signaled the need for new LNG capacity. As a result, given the long lead time required to develop LNG projects, we expect market balances to potentially remain tight for the next several years, exacerbated by the crisis in Europe and the reduction of Russian supply to the European market.  As shown in the middle chart, LNG imports from the U.S. have been the primary resource to offset the removal of over 50 Bcm of Russian gas imports from the European market this year, further reinforcing Jack's earlier point on the ability of U.S. LNG to respond quickly to market signals. As the primary source of global LNG supply growth for the past 4 years, the U.S. has surpassed Australia and Qatar to become the world's largest supplier measured by installed capacity this year, and this growth could not have come at a more critical time for Europe, given that inherent destination flexibility.  The U.S. has become Europe's top LNG supplier, and Cheniere's facilities at Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi have been significant contributors to this growth, helping provide secure and reliable natural gas supply to the European market, which I will detail further in a minute.  Despite the steady increase in LNG flows to Europe, TTF continued to rally in the third quarter, hitting an all-time high of about $99 per MMBtu in late August, as concerns surrounding adequacy of supply reached new levels. Since then, TTF prices have come off considerably, settling in October at about $54 in MMBtu, despite no sign of Nord Stream flows resuming. JKM [indiscernible] have traded at a discount to TTF for much of this year as European buyers have kept netbacks higher into the region compared to Asia in order to fill storage ahead of winter heating demand. In the U.S. Henry Hub prices have generally dropped since late August, settling in October at $6.87 in MMBtu as temperatures and forecasts moderated and gas production continued to rise.  Let's now turn to Page 9 to address regional dynamics in more detail. As I just mentioned, Europe has been utilizing LNG to try to offset as much of its gas supply deficit related to the Russian gas cuts by increasing its LNG imports by 65% this year with approximately 87 million tons imported through the third quarter, making 2022 an all-time high year for LNG imports into Europe. Imports from the U.S. represented 44% of that total. In fact, Cheniere alone was responsible for approximately 1/4 of Europe's LNG imports this year. As the top middle chart illustrates, U.S. LNG volumes surged over 200% year-on-year in the third quarter as Nord Stream flows came to a halt by the end of the quarter.  Nevertheless, the European market appears well prepared for winter as shown with storage levels exceeding their 5-year average on the back of milder weather, some level of industrial demand management and aggressive buying by European utilities. As such, we have recently seen prices moderate as the market waits for winter demand to kick in. We've also seen the congestion at certain European regas terminals continue to grow, once again, evidencing the need for development of additional import capacity and related infrastructure in order to provide relief and allow greater volumes of LNG to access the market, particularly in Northwest Europe.  Fortunately, the new Eemshaven import terminal in the Netherlands recently began operations. The terminal, one of the few FSRUs is expected to start in Europe in the coming months, received its first cargo in September, which was produced and delivered from our facility at Sabine Pass. In Asia, LNG imports declined by 14.5 million tons year-to-date with nearly 5 million tons of the decline realized in the third quarter. 90% of this decline is attributable to China as a result of reduced industrial sector demand and weak gas burn, which could remain a trend throughout this winter.  In China, industrial gas demand decreased by 3 Bcm in the third quarter, representing an 8.7% drop year-on-year, and low hydro levels supported thermal use in power generation with coal generation increasing by 11% year-on-year in the third quarter, while gas grew only 4%. However, overall gas-fired power generation dropped 8% year-on-year from January through September as high spot LNG prices and robust renewables generation in the first half of the year disincentivized domestic use and actually encouraged cargoes to be redirected to Europe. Much of the demand growth in Asia in the third quarter occurred in Thailand, Japan and Taiwan as a result of inelastic consumption needs.  As we mentioned in previous calls, Thailand continues to call on LNG to supplement dwindling domestic gas production. Japan plugged a 2.7-gigawatt deficit in nuclear availability in the third quarter and Taiwan continues to offset the decline in coal generation.  Let's move to Slide 10. Last quarter, we discussed LNG contracting trends and the growing commercial success that U.S. projects were garnering. That contracting momentum continued in the third quarter, reaching a total of 40 million tons per annum of long-term transactions signed with U.S. projects year-to-date that's through mid-October, highlighted by our long-term deals with PetroChina and PTT. As you can see on the left chart, the aggregate volume is approximately 80% higher than what was signed in all of 2021 and represents more than 75% of global contracts signed year-to-date. In fact, the first 9 months of 2022 alone make '22 a record year for U.S. LNG contracts signed. This commercial success is owed largely to several key advantages of U.S. LNG, destination flexibility, competitive and stable pricing, a mature upstream and midstream footprint and time to market. These advantages, coupled with elevated market prices, have provided tailwinds for the development of additional LNG capacity in the U.S. However, most of those U.S. projects still have yet to make FID given the rigorous commercial, financial, regulatory and technical hurdles, projects are required to overcome in order to raise financing and move forward with construction. And those hurdles are only getting higher given the volatility, inflation and rising interest rates.  For our part, as we discussed last month, we plan to continue to pursue growth of our 55 million-ton platform, starting with our near-term plans to add approximately 5 million tons per annum via the CCL Trains 8 and 9 mid-scale project and some debottlenecking at Stage 3 along with the long-term potential to add an incremental 30 million tons per annum of volume across our 2 sites. Volume that will continue to ensure security supply and sustainable economic growth for our long-term customers and end-use communities. We're hard at work on these opportunities, and we'll keep you informed on them as they achieve project development milestones.  And now I'll turn the call over to Zach to review our financial results and guidance. Jeremy, it's Anatol. Thanks for the question. The good news on the Europe front is it is moving very aggressively to resolve these infrastructure issues. We spoke about our honor to inaugurate Eemshaven. That facility will double. We do expect that throughout '23, about 60 million tons of additional regas capacity will be added. That number will probably get over 70 million tons in '24. But we agree with you, we think Europe is in no way out of the woods without that pipeline flow. It is really -- for most of this year, it is next winter that we were more worried about because, obviously, this winter did have the benefit of a substantial amount of flow even in the first half of this year before Nord Stream was fully shut off. So it will be a challenge. The infrastructure issues will be addressed over the next really 6 to 12 months. You've already seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of floating storage in Europe, and we think that, that was a little bit of weather and this additional infrastructure solutions will get cleaned up quickly. But the molecules for Europe will be very difficult to come by over the coming years. Weather-dependent, of course, as always, but entirely possible that it will be more difficult to reach these 80-plus percent full storage levels. Yes. Thanks, Marc. Anatol again. We expect that trend to play out. But I have to tell you kind of in the trenches, you haven't seen much of that. There are -- the competition among U.S. developers is still one that is anchoring expectations, buyer expectations in that low end of the range. I will say that it has been coming up somewhat, but in the aggregate between these aggressively priced offtake deals by some of the early-stage developers as well as the EPC inflationary pressures and the interest rate environment, that's a tough equation to solve, and we think that that's, of course, part of the reason why you haven't seen more projects [indiscernible]. Zach, do you want to add some thoughts on inflation? I really don't see this overbuild dynamic even in that '26, '27, '28 time frame. There's such an enormous amount of latent demand, if you will. We've been shying away from the term of demand destruction, right? We've termed a demand management. Even as prices pulled back in Europe modestly over the last 1 month, 1.5 months, you've seen a fairly dramatic resumption in industrial demand, right? So those numbers don't go away for a very long time. And yes, BASF and others may build facilities in the U.S. and in Qatar, but fundamentally, the demand picture in Europe just isn't going to change that much. And we still see a tremendous demand growth story out of Asia and EM in general. So we, of course, as you know, fully believe that the Qatari mega trades will continue to come on, the 4 under construction now, plus 2 more plus 2 more. There just aren't enough solutions and now with this very robust contracting, but relatively slow process to FID U.S. projects, that's just going to make the market that much tighter through the back half of this decade. So we see years and years of this dynamic before you can see a truly balanced market. Yes, Julien. So we felt comfortable with this to range. As you heard some of the previous Q&A, I mean the market overall for U.S. projects has firmed up a bit, but it is still very much anchored in those early-stage developer proposals. We've always felt like we extract a premium for the operational excellence and the performance that we now have a track record of. We don't participate in the race to the bottom, and we have a lot of components to our contractual agreements like the inflation mechanism that Zach spoke to earlier that are heavily negotiated, and we think will stand the test of time much better than most of the other proposals that are in the market. So we're still very comfortable with the returns responsible for the top line of that Zach equation. I think we can continue to deliver those types of economics. And yes, we [indiscernible] with this brownfield advantage and operational excellence and cargoes that are incrementally available from debottlenecking as part of that commercial value proposition, but the numbers that we're giving you today, we still feel very good and strong about. Yes. Thanks, Ben. We operate a long-term business that has long-term commitments and lots of flexibility within that. We learned our lessons really before we started in the market and are not in a position to risk being short-shipping. So we're well protected. Our delivered contracts and our producer contracts have a lot of optionality embedded in them that are paid for by our customers, and we take advantage of that, as Zach mentioned earlier, in some of the optimization opportunities we've experienced over this year. So we're in good shape and the market give us on that side at the moment. Yes, Alex. This is Anatol. I'll try that first and see if anyone else wants to chime in. But look, we -- with the loss of Arctic Russia as a major supply [indiscernible] to meet the LNG demand, U.S. was the next logical choice. You saw this rush to contract 40 million tons year-to-date and 30 million of that has yet to be performed on. And like with all of these -- there isn't a simple answer for these questions anymore as the market becomes large, diverse, has multiple participants. There are a lot of load serving entities in that 30 million tons that need the LNG, and there are a lot of opportunistic buyers in those 30 million tons that are just out there to see what can possibly get over the finish line and offer the kind of attractive economics that were too good to pass up. So there's some of each. We certainly think that we're in a great position to continue to grow our platform, do it judiciously and potentially benefit from some of the buyers that really need the supply over the coming years. Thanks, Craig, for the leading question. If I ever gave you the impression that we feel confident that there will be an armada of European load serving utilities as counterparties, I misspoke. I think that those will be few and far between. We, of course, have done the transactions with Equinor and Engie, as you know, this year, and we are optimistic that European-based buyers will be part of the portfolio and part of the solution going forward. But we do see the Asian market as the primary growth driver and the primary long-term contracting opportunity. Year-to-date, there have been freshest view, I think, what you would call European buyers that have come to the table. You'll see them here and there. We're obviously in those discussions. As you said, we bring a lot to the table, but they are fewer and far between. And even though we have been a critical part of rebalancing Europe last year and this year and we'll continue to do our best to support its efforts to meet its energy demands, we don't expect a lot of load serving European utilities to be in that 30-plus counterparty list going forward."

            "content": "Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today, and thank you all for your continued support of Cheniere. I'm pleased to be here this morning to highlight our third quarter 2022 results and achievements and discuss our positive outlook for the remainder of this year and into next, all of which continues to demonstrate Cheniere's market leadership and excellence throughout our business.  Since our capital allocation update in September, we have remained laser-focused on our operations, ensuring reliable LNG production and supply for our customers amidst global energy shortages and challenges. In fact, just last week, we had a daily production record for the company, producing well north of 7 TBtu of LNG and also a daily record at Sabine Pass of approximately 5 TBtu of LNG. My congratulations to the Cheniere professionals for a job well done.  Additionally, in conjunction with Bechtel's Engineering and Construction, we are off to a great start at Corpus Stage 3. We have rolled up our sleeves, hit the ground running and have already seen some early signs of potential acceleration on that project. Across the LNG market, volatility continues to dominate, driven by short-term supply-demand pressures. Recently, from record-breaking warmer weather, near-term prices have retreated from the highs we saw barely 2 months ago. Nevertheless, we are largely insulated from these price swings, given the highly contracted nature of our business, and we remain focused on long-term value creation as our priority with short-term market dislocations only serving to accelerate our long-term plans, as you heard from me and Zach in September.  Now please turn to Slide 5, where I will review some key operational, financial and strategic highlights from what was yet another very successful quarter. For the third quarter, we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.8 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $2.0 billion as margins in the LNG market remained significantly above historical norms and our focus on execution and our operational excellence program continued to be rewarded. Today, we are reconfirming our full year 2022 EBITDA and cash flow guidance, both of which were recently increased by over $1 billion when we announced our capital allocation plan in September.  In transit LNG shipments and commodity price, volatility increased the degree of difficulty in pinpointing the forecast, but we are tracking to the upper half of the EBITDA and DCF ranges currently. Later on this call, Zach will provide you with a few early data points on how 2023 is shaping up ahead of providing full year guidance on our February call.  As we've discussed, the reliability of our LNG operations is more critical than ever, given the volatility present in today's market. During the third quarter, we produced and exported 156 cargoes of LNG from our facilities. Of that, approximately 70% of that volume landed in Europe. By comparison, during the third quarter of last year, less than 30% of the volume produced by Cheniere landed in Europe. Not only does this shift underscore the value of our destination flexible LNG, which can quickly respond to market signals to reach end users of the greatest need, but is also providing meaningful energy volumes to Europe at a time when the region is facing significant challenges. The fact that these challenges could persist for a number of years has hastened a renewed focus on the criticality of energy security as governments and utilities the world over advance strategies to mitigate energy supply risks for the long term. Anatol will provide further insight to the current market dynamics in a few minutes.  During the quarter, we announced our 2020 Vision capital allocation plan, a revised comprehensive long-term capital allocation plan designed to maintain investment-grade credit metrics through cycles, further return capital to shareholders over time and continue to invest in accretive organic growth. The plan envisions $20 billion of available cash through 2026 and over $20 per share of run rate distributable cash flow. Zach will review some of the key features of the plan in a few minutes. But we believe our new 2020 vision is an excellent capital allocation framework for our stakeholders and the plan follows our significantly accelerated execution under the long-term capital allocation plan we implemented just over a year ago.  Before moving on, I also want to highlight important organizational announcement I made during the quarter. Organizational clarity and operational excellence are 2 of my key priorities. And as Cheniere has grown and evolved, so too must our organization in order to maintain an incredibly high operating standard we have set for ourselves. In September, we announced the promotion of Corey Grindal, currently Executive Vice President of Worldwide Trading in London, to serve as Cheniere's inaugural Chief Operating Officer, effective January 2023. Corey has been at Cheniere for nearly a decade, and his leadership and contributions have been an integral part of building the exceptional operating platform we enjoy today. Prior to his role, overseeing Worldwide Trading in London, Corey was SVP of Gas Supply and was the architect behind Cheniere's gas procurement program, which today is one of the largest holders of pipeline capacity and purchasers of natural gas in the United States. We look forward to Corey's continued leadership as COO, building upon our safety-first culture and reputation as a leading reliable supplier of LNG in the world. I'm pleased to welcome Corey back to Houston in his elevated role as COO. You all will begin to hear from Corey directly as he participates in investor conferences and these earnings calls next year.  Turn now to Slide 6. I'll give you a brief update on construction and execution across our Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi sites. First, last week, commissioning was completed for the third marine berth at Sabine Pass. And consistent with our track record, the third berth achieved substantial completion ahead of the guaranteed schedule and within project budgets. The third berth will not only provide increased flexibility to our marine loading operations, particularly during suboptimal conditions like fog events, but also serves as a brownfield infrastructure that we can economically leverage as we develop our expansion plans at Sabine Pass.  Now moving to Corpus Christi Stage 3. As I mentioned before, we are off and running and the project is making excellent progress. Inclusive of the early limited notice to proceed we utilized at the start of the year, we've invested approximately $1 billion to date of Stage 3. The LNTP not only provided cost benefits, enabling us to lock in prices early, but also provided some significant construction schedule advantages with early site work, such as [indiscernible]. Long lead time equipment orders have been placed with suppliers, and key equipment manufacturing is expected to start before year-end.  We recently held a groundbreaking ceremony at the Stage 3 site, and it was exciting to see such overwhelming support for the project across a broad spectrum of stakeholders who help make the project possible from regulators, government officials, to long-term customers, EPC and equipment providers, banks and, of course, our employees. As we work towards first LNG from Stage 3 in late 2025, I look forward to upholding Cheniere's stellar reputation on safety and execution and partnership with Bechtel.  Thank you all again for your continued support of Cheniere. I'll now turn the call over to Anatol, who will provide an update on the LNG market. Michael, thanks. So first, on construction in Stage 3, I'm extremely pleased at the progress to date. You can tell from my talking points that I perfectly expect my staff and Bechtel to have underpromise and overdeliver on my expectations. And -- it's a little early at this point for us to revise our schedule. But I would stay tuned if we continue to have this favorable weather and we continue to execute the way the plant has developed.  As far as maintenance, you're right, we try to do maintenance in the shoulder months where LNG prices typically are lowest. It's a 6-year cycle at Sabine. So it's an unusual year for us where we have 2 trains coming down basically at the same time to do maintenance on them. As far as quantities of the maintenance, I'll turn it over to Zach and he can give you more detail on that part of it. Jean, this is Jack. I always track how much capital is being invested in natural gas infrastructure around the world, and there's over $1 trillion right now of nat gas projects around the world with pipelines and power plants in regas facilities. So that, to me, is a signal that gas is here, it's here to stay for the long term and that the LNG side of it will continue to grow. Yes. No, Jean, I'll tell you, over the last 6 years, we've doubled our business here at Cheniere. And today, more than ever, that permitting strategy, I believe, is essential, right, because it's more and more difficult with the current regulatory environment to make any mid-course changes, whether they're on design or construction. So we filed -- we prefiled for Midscale Trains 8, 9 that got accepted not too long ago. There's a 6-month period after prefiling that we need to wait. It's our expectation that we will file immediately thereafter, so early next year with 8, 9 and then -- and hopefully, my goal is to make those trains contiguous. So right after Train 7 is commissioned, I want to go to Train 8 and then to Train 9. So we're trying to move quickly. I think that's just strategically the whole permitting strategy part and making sure that you've crossed the t's and dotted the i's and your application is more important [indiscernible]. No, look, you know from our talking points that and Anatol's talking point that we're looking at 30-plus MTPA of growth across the portfolio. I would expect Sabine to be first. I'd expect sometime next year that we do a prefiling for additional growth there at Sabine. But again, like I said, we're making sure that we understand everything it is to know about that growth and that, that filing is complete, so it gets accepted and moved through the process appropriately. And then right after that, hopefully, Trains 8 and 9 will be done at Corpus, and we can focus on whatever additional expansion plans we have there. So I think, Julien, you should expect some overlap between the 2 sites. We're not going to have overlap on 1 site. Thank you for mentioning that because the night before was a bad night and last night made up for. So we're very excited to have him come back home and bring home the World Series right here in Houston. No. We're looking at all the technologies. So we're looking at gas compression. We're looking at large electric compression. We're looking at Midscale electric compression. So we're doing a complete evaluation. I like the Midscale solution for Stage 3. It helped control the inflationary pressures that we see on the large trains with a lot of [indiscernible] nickel and precious metals. But it doesn't mean that's where we're going to stay for the rest of the portfolio. So we'll develop a solution that is appropriate for the site. Thanks, everybody. Thanks for your support of Cheniere."

            "name": "Zach Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Anatol, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our third quarter 2022 financial results and key financial accomplishments, all of which continue to reflect our team's tireless efforts to ensure safe and reliable operations and seamless execution throughout this period of prolonged volatility in the global energy markets.  Turning to Slide 12. During the third quarter, we generated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.8 billion, distributable cash flow of approximately $2 billion and a net loss of approximately $2.4 billion. Our third quarter results once again were supported by the sustained higher margin environment across global gas and LNG markets. Higher lifting margins due to higher Henry Hub prices across the quarter, and incremental margin achieved from certain portfolio optimization activities. Our quarterly results were achieved despite a couple of CMI cargoes moving into Q4 from Q3. In addition, in the third quarter, we recognized a portion of the payment from Chevron related to the early termination of the regasification TUA, which we expect to receive before year-end. We recognized [indiscernible] 560 TBtu of physical LNG during the third quarter, including 556 TBtu produced from our Sabine Pass or Corpus Christi projects and 4 TBtu sourced from third parties. Approximately 82% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SPA or IPM agreements with terms greater than 10 years.  Once again, the net income line continues to be impacted by the unrealized noncash derivative impact related to our long-term IPM agreements, as we have discussed on prior earnings calls. In the third quarter, we recognized $4.9 billion of these unrealized noncash [indiscernible] losses attributable to the continued growth of LNG margins and commodity price volatility. As a reminder, because GAAP requires mark-to-market accounting of these long-term gas supply agreements, but does not permit the mark-to-market of the associated and offsetting sale of LNG, it results in a mismatch of accounting methodology for the purchase of natural gas and the corresponding sale of LNG, which drives this quarterly variability in net income from period to period. That is why we would expect as margins stabilize and price volatility subsides over time that these unrealized noncash derivative moves will become much less pronounced in our quarterly results.  Thanks in large part to the significantly accelerated progress on our capital allocation plan announced in September of 2021. During the quarter, we rolled out our revised long-term capital allocation plan. Our 2020 vision of over $20 billion of available cash through 2026 as well as over $20 per share of run rate distributable cash flow. Built upon the foundation of our previous plan, this plan is designed to achieve and maintain investment-grade metrics through cycles, further return capital to shareholders over time and continue to invest in accretive growth beyond Corpus Christi Stage 3. As part of the revised plan, we increased our share repurchase authorization by $4 billion for an additional 3 years, beginning October 1, 2022. Lowered our consolidated long-term leverage target to approximately 4x and increased the dividend by 20% beginning in the third quarter of 2022, targeting a 10% annual dividend growth rate through the construction of Stage 3 into the mid-2020. Our accelerated progress in terms of capital allocation, coupled with our revised plan demonstrates the power of the Cheniere platform through market cycles and solidifies nearest position as a leading global LNG operator and a preeminent North American infrastructure company.  During the quarter, we repaid over $1.3 billion of consolidated long-term indebtedness, bringing our total debt pay down to over $4.4 billion through the third quarter since launching our capital allocation plan last year. And in the first 9 months of this year, we have repaid over $3.2 billion of debt. Just in the third quarter alone, we prepaid nearly $800 million of outstanding borrowings on the CCH term loan facility. And notably, we repurchased over $530 million in principle of senior notes at both CEI and CCH at price levels under par under an open market repurchase program that was initiated during the quarter.  This past month, we have also redeemed $300 million of the 2023 senior secured notes at SBL, pursuant to an early redemption notice issued in September. We are clearly demonstrating our commitment to our balance sheet by utilizing multiple avenues to efficiently reach those target leverage metrics, and we will continue to be opportunistic as we optimize the debt across the Cheniere complex to achieve resilient and sustainable investment-grade credit metrics.  Our accelerated deleveraging efforts towards an investment-grade consolidated balance sheet have been reflected in ratings upgrades by multiple agencies recently. In September, Moody's upgraded CEI 2 notches to Ba1 and CQP and SBL 1 notch to Ba1 and Baa2, bringing all S&P and Moody's ratings in sync across the Cheniere complex. Also in September, Fitch upgraded CQP to BBB- and SBL to BBB+. Fitch's upgrade of CQP to BBB- is significant as Americas the first-ever unsecured investment-grade rating at one of our corporate parent entities, and it's an important milestone in Cheniere's continued evolution.  We will continue to execute on our 2020 Vision plan and expect further positive ratings momentum and migration to investment grade over time.  In terms of shareholder returns, during the third quarter, we repurchased over 0.5 million shares for approximately $75 million, bringing our total shares repurchased to approximately 5 million shares for a little over $600 million. The upside share repurchase authorization we announced as part of our new capital allocation plan didn't commence until the fourth quarter. And I can tell you we are off and running under the new authorization, having already repurchased over 1 million shares just in October as we have now recalibrated our debt paydown to share repurchase ratio through 2026 on a long-term cumulative basis from 4:1 to 1:1 to further enhance shareholder returns while further solidifying our long-term investment-grade credit metrics.  During the third quarter, we also declared and paid our fourth quarterly dividend of $0.33 per common share, bringing our total dividends paid to $1.32 per common share. Under our new capital allocation plan, we increased the dividend by 20% for the dividend related to the third quarter to $0.395 per common share and maintain our commitment to increasing the dividend by approximately 10% per year through Stage 3 construction, which will grow us into around a 20% payout ratio over time.  Turn now to Slide 13, where I'll provide additional detail on our guidance and our open capacity for the remainder of the 2022 as well as for 2023. We are reconfirming our full year 2022 guidance ranges of $11 billion to $11.5 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $8.1 billion to $8.6 billion in distributable cash flow. These ranges were each already increased by approximately $1.2 billion since our last earnings call in September, and we can now highlight that we are currently tracking into the upper half of both ranges as well as to the high end of our CQP distribution guidance of $4 to $4.25 per unit. Our guidance ranges illustrate what an incredible year 2022 has been for Cheniere. Since our initial guidance ranges for 2022 were provided 12 months ago, we have increased the midpoint of our EBITDA range by approximately 85%, DCF by approximately 150% and CQP distribution by approximately 1/3. With respect to the EBITDA sensitivity for the remainder of 2022, we are approaching the end of the year, and therefore, we have sold much of our total expected production for the remainder of the year and have approximately 20 TBtu unsold remaining. We currently forecast that a $1 change in market margin would impact EBITDA by approximately $20 million the balance of 2022 as we have released the remaining volume that had been reserved for long-term origination back to C&I. Our results could also be impacted by those year-end cargoes we mentioned back on our call in September. With the volatility and evolving market dynamics, these cargoes could be drawn to Asia, which would push the timing of recognition of some of these cargoes into 2023.  With that being said, as we look to 2023 and our sensitivity to market margin, currently, we forecast approximately 150 TBtu of open volumes in 2023 and we expect a $1 change in market margin to impact 2023 EBITDA by approximately $130 million as a portion of our forecasted unsold volume for next year is being reserved for potential long-term origination negotiations. We do have some term contracts commencing over the course of the year. There is likely a slight weighting of that open volume to the first half of the year.  In terms of major capital expenditures, I would mainly highlight we forecast spending approximately $1.5 billion in CapEx related to Corpus Christi Stage 3 in 2023, which is a similar amount to what we expect to have funded this year, including our LNTP payments since the start of 2022. As we mentioned in September, we will provide our full year EBITDA, DCF and CQP distribution guidance ranges for 2023 on the fourth quarter call in February. Our unsold position in 2023 is expected to be lower than 2022 as 2022 benefited from the early completion and ramp-up of Train 6 and the maintenance optimization we disclosed in May. Certain long-term contracts are scheduled to commence over the course of 2023, and we have [indiscernible] planned maintenance scheduled for the next year at Sabine. Without a new train coming into service next year, we wouldn't expect a material change to the production forecast from here.  The current state of global gas markets, which have featured elevated market margins for nearly a year now, underscore the global call for meaningful investment in natural gas infrastructure, which Cheniere is leading with our recent sanctioning of Corpus Christi Stage 3. During this prolonged period of heightened volatility, we've been deliberate and prudent stewards of capital, accelerating progress on our capital allocation objectives and positioning Cheniere for resilient success in the decades to come. And we expect to lead with a sustainable investment-grade balance sheet, accretive growth projects and meaningful and growing shareholder returns.  That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions. Michael, as we think about '22 versus '23, we're going to be slightly up year-over-year on total production and that's really mainly due to the Train 6. We had about 11 months of production hitting P&L last -- this year with a little ramp-up in Q1. We have a full year of Train 6 for '23. But that will be offset a bit by this major maintenance that is definitively planned for next year. So basically, I'd say we are probably rounding down to 44 million tons for the year this year, and we'll be right around 45 million tons where the rest of the 7 trains are not -- that won't have the maintenance, we'll pick up the slack to an extent. That's about it, Michael. I mean the $1.5 billion is the, let's say, all-in levered costs that we would deploy next year. And honestly, that's kind of what we expect this year. We've spent about $1 billion already pre-FID and post-FID and have another $400 million to $500 million to go this quarter as we're like 12% progressed at Stage 3. On other CapEx, we're going to be spending money, let's say, hundreds of millions of dollars across the board on things to continue to optimize, but also develop at Corpus and Sabine. And you're just not going to notice it as clearly, we'll have billing into DCF next year when we come out with it officially in February. Sure. So clearly, you could see in Q2, we bought back over $500 million of stock during that June period, specifically [Technical Difficulty] the stock had a little pressure on it, and we were opportunistic. And then if you just look at Q3 from to , the stock went up like $35. So you can imagine, as the stock is going up, we're obviously being less opportunistic. But when things are a little bit more stagnant or obviously, there's pressure on the stock, we're hitting it harder. And then another -- the other thing I'd add is we clearly had to wait till the announcement on capital allocation in mid-September, just with all the [indiscernible] that came with that to officially set up the 10b5-1 for Q4. And that's why the new plan with the upside allocation started in earnest in Q4, and we've already bought back over 1 million shares just in October. Jeremy, it's Zach. So a few things materialized for us in terms of -- I think there was an extra cargo at Corpus. Optimization, I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we had higher subchartering revenue as we really position the whole portfolio going into the winter and with elevated pricings on shipping, that added some money. And then we obviously were a little proactive on selling into the market even in September before the market came down a bit and now it is now just over $10 for the rest of the year. And that was offset a bit even by some crossover cargoes that we've pushed out again into '23. They're moving back and forth depending on whether they're going to hit Europe or Asia. So it only took a few hundred million there. And that's not to mention we released those final origination cargoes. We pretty much rolled those over into 2023 to keep that in the arsenal for the long-term origination team. But with all that, yes, we feel pretty good we'll be in the upper half of the guidance range. Sure. So just to acknowledge the inflation out there that's clearly happening for everybody, and we think about our operating expenses or even our SG&A, our SPAs, which we have over 30 of with different counterparties all over the world, they all have a built-in annual escalator based on CPI for, let's say, approximately, give or take, 15%. And if you just bake that in and with how much we have in fixed fees, going into the new year, we're more than covering any inflation on O&M and SG&A for the company, which just highlights the stability of that run rate cash flow. Yes. So what we acknowledged in the prepared remarks and in the presentation is we actually have 150 TBtu truly open. And of that, we're reserving 20 TBtu for origination placeholders, so that $130 million, give or take, for a $1 move in margin, that's open today. However, I'd say we have probably sold onward and locked in fixed margins for around 20 TBtu for 2023 at this point. Clearly, the liquidity is pretty tough with how volatile it's been. But we're making a dent there and we'll give an even more robust update next year. Sure. So this is Zach. And I have mentioned this previously on calls, but it's just a totally different world than it was, let's say, 18 to 24 months ago, where you could lock in a cargo and maybe tie up capital for, I don't know, $10 million, $15 million, $20 million. We're tying up cargoes now into the end of the year, and that potentially requires us to reserve capital of almost $200 million. And we start talking about tying up cargoes financially into next year or a quarter plus away. That's over $0.5 billion still. So the volatility is just so elevated and even with, I guess, a drop in LNG prices to an extent even though we're still talking about $10-plus this year, $20-plus next year and onward, it just doesn't make it too tenable to handle 130 TBtu that are open for us. So what the CMI team has done tremendously well this year and is already doing as we speak, is selling physical cargoes on a fixed price basis or even on a Henry Hub plus basis. And that's how we've been able to give you these guidance updates with confidence, even though there's been just so much volatility. So for the time being, yes, we don't see financially hedging as a large tool for the company, but it will be a tool. I mean you see there's still margin deposits on the balance sheet of over $200 million for the quarter. So we're using it, but we're being quite selective. All right. This is Zach. I'm going to try to answer some of that and then I'll hand it off to Anatol. But basically, what a lot of these folks are experiencing as they try to FID really don't pertain to us today. I mean we started locking in our costs earlier this year, and then we have a lump sum turnkey contract where I can still say to you that -- we're building Stage 3 at 6x CapEx to EBITDA, and it's under a lump sum turnkey contract with Bechtel and we have hundreds of millions of dollars of contingency that were baked into that cost that we haven't touched. So we feel very good that we were able to be competitive in our to range for long-term contracts, and we're going to make double-digit unlevered returns on Stage 3. We're in the process of permitting Trains 8 and 9 on top of that. Obviously, they're going to be incredibly cost-effective considering we're not using [indiscernible] to expand there. And we'll see where those prices shake out. But we think it's going to be extremely competitive, and we'll be able to offer a really competitive price out there without elevating prices all that much, if at all. I'll hand it off to Anatol though. And it's nice to add that we're not really issuing debt all that much these days. We're just paying down billions of dollars a day. So we're just in a different world than we would have been 10 years ago in a rising rate environment. Yes. I'll just add. I mean at this point, we're basically the second largest charter of ships in the world. And we've been proactive on this as we sign up the [indiscernible] deals or IPM deals. We're typically almost simultaneously locking in long-term charters. So going into this winter, even going into this year, we've had a large portfolio that's well under $100,000 a day when prices have been doubled, tripled, sometimes quadrupled or more. So that's been part of the tailwinds to EBITDA this year and even part of how we got to the upper end of the guidance range at this point in just the last month is some of the subchartering that we've been able to do as we haven't used all our ships to get to Asia, but are directing them towards Europe. Sure. This is Zach again. And I'll just say we feel quite confident that our balance sheet strategy has been validated even recently. With the momentum on the ratings, upgrades, finally starting to catch up to the momentum on the debt paydown on the credit metrics that are at this point under 3x even on an LTM basis. But I guess how I'll put it is we're on the -- in the spirit of the Astros being in the World Series and then they hit last night, we're in the home stretch on getting [indiscernible]. And basically, the game plan is we're going to inundate or overwhelm them with a little more debt paydown and EBITDA growth. And yes, it's just going to be too evident when you add on to that the execution from operations and construction and just the contracts. I mean we have over 30 counterparties, average rating, remaining life of the contracts is 17 years for over 90% of our capacity. So when you add all that up, yes, we're pretty confident we're going to get there by the first half of 2023, if not sooner. And yes, seeing all the agencies provide upgrades already this year, we're just getting started there."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Randy Bhatia. Please go ahead sir. \nRandy Bhatia : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Cheniere's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. The slide presentation and access to the webcast for today's call are available at cheniere.com. Joining me this morning are Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO; Anatol Feygin, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Zach Davis, Executive Vice President and CFO. Before we begin, I would like to remind all listeners that our remarks including answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from what is described in these statements. Slide 2 of our presentation contains a discussion of those forward-looking statements and associated risks. In addition, we may include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the appendix of the slide presentation. As part of our discussion of Cheniere's results today's call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP or CQP. We do not intend to cover CQP's results separately from those of Cheniere Energy Inc. The call agenda is shown on slide 3. Jack will begin with operating and financial highlights. Anatol will then provide an update on the LNG market, and Zach will review our financial results and guidance. After prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. I will now turn the call over to Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO. \nJack Fusco: Thank you Randy. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today and thank you all for your continued support of Cheniere. I'm pleased to be here this morning to review our second quarter 2022 achievements and discuss our 2022 positive outlook. The second quarter achievements were highlighted by the positive FID of Corpus Christi Stage III earlier this summer. In June, we issued a full notice to proceed to Bechtel, which had already commenced early construction under a limited notice to proceed earlier this year. The strategy of releasing Bechtel under limited notice to proceed ahead of a full FID continues to pay dividends as it locks in schedule and cost, which is especially important in today's inflationary environment. We are excited to move forward on this highly economic growth project, which will strengthen our market-leading LNG infrastructure platform and provide much needed LNG to the global market. The FID of Stage III is a milestone. The entire Cheniere workforce should be proud of as it was made possible by everyone's dedicated and tireless efforts to bring this project to fruition. Over the last decade, Cheniere has set the bar on safety and project execution and we look forward to continuing those results with Stage III. Please turn to slide 5 where I will review some of the key operational financial and strategic highlights from what was a very busy and successful quarter as well as introduce our upwardly revised financial guidance ranges for the full year. For the second quarter, we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.5 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $1.9 billion as margins in the LNG market remains significantly above historical norms and our focus on operational excellence continue to be rewarded. Our EBITDA and cash flow metrics for the second quarter both exceeded what we achieved in the first half of 2021, a powerful illustration of the impact of world-class execution and safe, reliable operations, which have become synonymous with the Cheniere brand. The energy crisis in Europe continues to evolve and it is at the center of a tragic and devastating war. The United States is blessed with an abundance of low-cost natural gas and I am proud that our collective efforts at Cheniere are having a direct and positive impact on the lives of so many people around the world. We produced loaded and exported 156 cargoes in the second quarter, as our operations benefited from the full quarter of operations of Train 6 at Sabine Pass. As of the end of the second quarter, nearly 225 cargoes of LNG, which is over 70% of the cargoes produced at our facilities so far this year have landed in Europe. By comparison, in the first half of last year, less than 40% of the cargoes produced by Cheniere landed in Europe. Clearly, the benefits of the flexibility inherent in the commercial structures of our contracts are on display. That is enabling the LNG we produce to reach the markets with the greatest need. For the third quarter in a row, our guidance ranges for 2022 are moving higher by over $1 billion. We now forecast consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $9.8 billion to $10.3 billion and distributable cash flow of $6.9 billion to $7.4 billion. Thanks to the expected lump sum payment by Chevron under the termination of the regasification EUA and marketing margins moving higher compared to our prior forecast. Zach will address guidance in more detail in his comments in a few minutes. On the marketing origination front Anatol and his team have been racking up frequent flier miles and bringing home more long-term contracts with customers around the world looking to secure long-term reliable supplies of LNG in support of energy security and energy transition. Just since the start of the second quarter and through July, we have entered into long-term contracts aggregating approximately 140 million tonnes through 2030, since our first quarter earnings call. We announced long-term SPAs with POSCO International, Equinor, Chevron, PetroChina and PTT. All of these contracts extended beyond 2040 and the PetroChina SPA is our first LNG contract that extends into the second half of this century. Over the last 12 months we have signed SPAs and IPM deals aggregating up to approximately 15 million tonnes per annum and up to over 240 million tonnes in aggregate. The contracts with Equinor, Chevron and PetroChina each contain a provision where the long-term contracted firm volume will double either once we make a positive FID on liquefaction capacity expansions at Corpus Christi beyond Stage III or we unilaterally commit to the volume. So after reaching FID on Stage III only weeks ago, we've already sold an incremental almost three million tonnes per annum of volume beyond Stage III. Those contracts clearly demonstrate the demand in the market and my leadership team and I are very focused on Cheniere's next phase of growth. The investments we made at Sabine Pass in Corpus Christi over the last decade provide both of those sites with significant brownfield expansion opportunities and you can be certain we're pursuing growth at both facilities. At Corpus Christi, we see a number of potential ways to leverage the infrastructure we've built or are building to add economically advantaged LNG capacity from a smaller scale edition that could conceivably be done faster all the way to a very large expansion on the land adjacent to Stage III we've shown you in the past.  At Sabine Pass, with our third birth nearing completion, infrastructure hurdles to expanding SPL are being cleared and we are currently developing plans for a potentially significant expansion of that facility as well. Later this year, I look forward to providing more detail on our growth plans at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi as we move into the regulatory process and communicating our enhanced capital allocation plans for the coming years. Turn now to slide six. On these calls, you've heard me talk about our operational excellence program. That program establishes the key operating philosophy of Cheniere of which safety, reliability, and efficiency form the foundation. That program ensures safe operations and maintenance of our facilities, while maximizing production and efficiency. While always one of my key priorities, operational reliability has become a key focus of those outside Cheniere as well, especially with high LNG market prices in Europe in the midst of an energy crisis. First and foremost, with respect to safety, we have a safety-first culture at Cheniere and I'm extremely proud that our safety record demonstrates that. On the bottom of slide six, the graph shows our total recordable incident rate, the preeminent safety metric of an operating facility, and a metric that is part of the compensation calculation for each and every Cheniere employee. You can see that not only have we exhibited consistent improvement over the course of last year during which we commissioned and started commercial operations of Train 6, but also that Cheniere's performance on this metric is comfortably within our industry's top quartile. Safety and reliability go hand-in-hand. It signifies an employee's ownership in the facility, a strong safety metric and operations typically leads to reliable operations of the facility. The middle of the slide shows our facility utilization since 2021 which is yielding production consistent with our run rate range of 4.9 million to 5.1 million tonnes per annum per train. Our utilization is consistently above 90% compares favorably to the 2021 global average of about 80% and demonstrates the value of our operational excellence program. I tell our operations leadership team that safety is an investment not an expense and the return on that safety investment is clearly in the results we reported this morning. Turn now to slide seven. We'll highlight two significant milestones recently achieved with respect to our ESG and Climate and Sustainability initiatives that demonstrates Cheniere's leadership position in these areas. First during the second quarter, we commenced providing our cargo emission tags or CE tags to our long-term customers. These tags are the first of its kind innovation in our industry and provide our customers with the estimated greenhouse gas emission profile of each LNG cargo from the wellhead to the cargo delivery point. The data on the tag is calculated utilizing our proprietary life cycle analysis, improving the accuracy of the emissions data relative to industry estimates. Cheniere CE tags are a tangible result of our prioritization of data-driven environmental transparency. We expect the tags will help identify opportunities to quantify and improve environmental performance throughout the LNG supply chain. In addition, in June, we published our third annual corporate responsibility report entitled Acting Today Securing Tomorrow. I am proud of the continued progress we are able to detail in these annual reports. As Cheniere is emerging as a leader in ESG for natural gas companies, with a focus on being actionable not aspirational. On that note, I want to take a moment to address some of the recent news and speculation regarding Cheniere, the EPA and the National Emission Standards for hazardous air floods, our niche shape rule. The EPA recently lifted a near two decades stay of that rule covering the types of turbines which we utilize at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi. At Cheniere, regulatory compliance is a strategic priority. Consistent with our ESG focus on being actionable, our company values and our commitment as a responsible operator. We work constructively with federal state and local regulatory authorities to ensure prudent operations in compliance with current regulatory requirements. We value the fact that we operate under a regulatory regime in this country that seeks and values input from the industry. And we have been in touch with the EPA, regarding our concerns with respect to the rule. Currently, we are working diligently at our facilities to perform the initial testing required by the nice shop [ph]. While we don't believe our turbine should be subject to the rule as the use in LNG operations was not contemplated by EPA in the original 2003 rule making, we will work with the EPA and the relevant state agencies to develop an acceptable path forward to compliance if applicable. At this time, it is too early to discuss what, if any specific changes would be needed. However, we are confident that if necessary would be able to develop a solution that would enable compliance without a material financial or production impact. My conviction in Cheniere's LNG platform has never been stronger. We look forward to continuing to lead the LNG industry in terms of safety, operational excellence and environmental transparency in order to provide the world with a cleaner more secure and reliable energy solution. Thank you, all again for your continued support of Cheniere. I will now turn the call over to Anatol, who will provide an update on the LNG market.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Jack and good morning everyone. Please turn to slide 9. As everyone is aware, the energy world has been caught in a mail stream of geopolitical and macroeconomic events that are feeding volatility and heightening uncertainty in the market. All of which have had consequential impacts on supply, trade patterns and consumer behavior across energy commodities. Amid this volatility, total LNG demand continue to grow, albeit constrained by lack of new supply and sustained elevated prices, undoubtedly contributing to the record amount of commercial activity in the second quarter. After a brief pullback in LNG spot prices in the second quarter, we've seen concerns over the dependability of Russian pipeline supply, plus numerous LNG supply issues pushed JKM and TTF forward curves back into the $40 to $50 an MMBtu range through the coming winter, pushing European electricity prices to record highs. JKM prompt month futures continue to trade at a discount to TTF during the quarter, as Europe priced cargoes away from Asia and this discount has widened as a result of further cuts to gas flows into Europe in recent weeks. During the quarter, we saw pipeline imports from Russia into Europe, excluding Turkey continued to fall, reaching modern aero lows of just over 5.5 Bcf a day in June, prior to Nord Streams annual maintenance period. US LNG imports into Europe excluding Turkey again surpassed Russian pipeline volumes for the first time in June and again in July. On the LNG side there have also been several supply disruptions as well as seasonal maintenance activities which have also acted to tighten the market. The outage at Freeport LNG has removed the equivalent of approximately 2 Bcf a day of LNG from the market. Industrial action at Shell's Prelude beginning June 10 slowed production and resulted in a shutdown beginning around July 11, which remains idle as of early August. And the restart of Norway's Hammerfest LNG which had been offline since September of 2020 was delayed to early June. Several other projects in Angola the US and Indonesia also underwent routine planned maintenance as expected in the shoulder months tightening the market further. Despite the supply challenges in LNG a recovery from below average production during the same period in 2021 contributed to a 7% year-over-year increase in global LNG exports which reached 100 million tonnes in the second quarter consistent with the previous two quarters. The US alone exported 19.6 million tonnes in the second quarter up 12% or 2.1 million tonnes year-on-year due in large part to additional capacity online at SPL Train 6. While the US was the largest LNG exporter in the first half of the year total exported volume declined modestly in the second quarter due primarily to planned maintenance and Freeport's outage. Finally, in the US gas market although Henry Hub prices have also recently touched new multiyear highs domestic prices are still well below the relative spikes in both JKM and TTF. The July contract settled at $6.55 an M [ph] down 26% relative to the June contract as supply increased and demand moderated in early June loosening the US gas balance. Since then, prices have moved up again on an unprecedented early summer heat. We're seeing a response to the price signal in the rig count as gas-directed rigs in the US are up approximately 50% year-over-year to 157 rigs. So, we would expect gas production to increase from current levels in the near future. Please turn to slide 10 for more detail on gas and LNG supply and demand in Europe and Asia. As discussed, the global LNG market remained tight in the second quarter despite winter coming to an end and a notable decline in Chinese imports. Consumers continue to endure high spot prices for natural gas especially in Europe given the reduction in Russian gas flows. During the quarter LNG deliveries to Europe climbed 40% year-on-year with volumes from the US increasing by nearly 130% year-on-year including flows from Cheniere which also increased by over 130%. Nevertheless, risks of further cuts to Russian flows continue to rise maintaining upward pressure on prices. In mid-June Nord Stream flows were reduced to approximately 40% of the capacity. And following the end of the quarter the scheduled maintenance reduced close to zero from July 11 to 20. Flows initially resumed the premaintenance levels but have since fallen to 20% of capacity. Amid these risks and high prices Germany raised its gas emergency plan to alert level while the European Commission proposed measures to reduce gas use in Europe by 15% until next spring. In the meantime, Europe continues to fast-track plans to increase LNG import capacity by over 50% to approximately 280 million tonnes per annum and has already sanctioned 11 new regas terminals representing approximately 40 million tonnes per annum just in the first half of this year. In Asia LNG demand declined about 5% in the second quarter most of which was attributable to economic headwinds in China. The country's GDP growth rate decelerated to 0.4% in the second quarter from 4.8% in the first. Shanghai the largest financial hub in the country endured strict COVID lockdowns, which was a contributing factor to a year-over-year decline in China's absolute GDP during Q2. Gas demand in the country fell 8% as a result, as city gas and power sector consumption contracted. Elsewhere in Asia, overall, demand growth was somewhat flat, although, we observed improved demand in JKT and Thailand. Nuclear power generation in Japan was down year-on-year, which led to a 9% increase in LNG imports, while maintenance of coal-fired power plants in Korea sustained existing LNG import levels. Thailand continued to exhibit LNG demand strength as higher consumption requirements offset its dwindling domestic production. The relative weakness in Asia year-to-date has counterbalanced the heightened demand in Europe, but we expect this to be a transient phenomenon with near-term weather and longer-term organic growth confirming that long-term fundamentals in Asia remains strong with ample upside potential. This view is underscored by the demonstrated appetite for long-term LNG volumes exhibited by Asian customers this quarter, including our recently announced long-term contracts with POSCO, PetroChina and PTT. Please turn to Slide 11. Needless to say, the impact of Europe's energy crisis have already been far reaching, with significant consequences observed across multiple sectors of the economy, including food and commodities. This backdrop has exposed some vulnerabilities within gas and LNG markets around the world not just in Europe and has accelerated the impetus for gas consumers to secure reliable long-term LNG supply. In the first half of 2022, buyers around the world signed nearly 38 million tonnes per annum of firm long-term contracts globally, the highest level since at least 2016. Most of these from contracts or 28 MTPA were signed with US sellers potentially underpinning a new round of LNG infrastructure investment in the US. In just the first seven months of 2022, we have already had our most productive year for long-term contracting since 2011 continuing to successfully grow our portfolio of diverse creditworthy customers. The long-term deals we concluded, completed the commercialization of Stage III. And as Jack mentioned, LNG buyers have already begun to contract to our next phase of growth. Our commercial success further cements our position as the LNG provider of choice for buyers worldwide. Since just the start of the second quarter, we executed long-term transactions with FOB, DES and IPM structures with creditworthy counterparties from Asia, Europe, Canada and the US super major. This geographic and structural diversity is a prime illustration of the value of the Cheniere brand that Jack referenced and what sets Cheniere apart. The certainty on execution, the safe and reliable operations and our unrivaled ability to structure long-term energy solutions tailored to fit the needs and preferences of a diverse global customer base. On the buyer side, you can see from the middle chart that a greater variety of buyer types are contracting for US LNG given the stability and flexibility Gulf Coast FOB volumes can provide for their portfolios. While portfolio players still represent a significant portion of US LNG buyers or prospective buyers, we observed that the end user segment has also been growing, including those potentially servicing Europe. Finally, while Europe's target to displace Russian gas certainly creates a near-term increase in LNG demand, you can see from the chart on the right that credible commentators are forecasting this heightened demand to persist despite expectations for the region to reduce its overall gas demand over that same period. This uncertainty highlights Europe and the world's need for flexibility and reliability of supply to highly valued attributes of the long-term product we offer. Our conviction in the long-term global market fundamentals for our products remain as strong as ever, and our demonstrated ability to construct LNG solutions tailored to customers across the globe places Cheniere in an ideal position to continue to win business and grow our market-leading LNG platform for many years to come. And now I'll turn the call over to Zach to review our financial results and guidance. \nZach Davis: Thanks, Anatol and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our second quarter 2022 financial results, our key financial accomplishments and our increased 2022 guidance, all of which reflects the hard work and dedication of the Cheniere team, the reliability of our platform and the volatile state of the global energy markets Anatol just described. Turning to Slide 13. During the second quarter, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $2.5 billion, distributable cash flow of approximately $1.9 billion and net income of over $700 million. Our second quarter results once again were driven by the sustained higher margin environment across global LNG markets, coupled with higher lifting margins, due to higher Henry Hub prices. We recognized an income 574 TBtu of physical LNG during the second quarter including 570 TBtu from our projects and four TBtu sourced from third parties. Approximately 85% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SPA or IPM agreements. We are pleased to announce that we generated positive net income of $741 million in the second quarter. However, the net income line continues to be impacted by the unrealized non-cash derivative impact related to our long-term IPM agreements as we have discussed on prior earnings calls. In fact we recognized $1.3 billion of these unrealized non-cash derivative losses in the second quarter alone, as Gulf Coast netback curves continue to rise in Q2. As a reminder, because GAAP requires mark-to-market accounting of these long-term gas supply agreements but does not permit the mark-to-market of the associated sale of LNG, resulting in a mismatch of accounting methodology for the purchase of natural gas and the corresponding sale of LNG, which drives this quarterly variability in net income from period-to-period. As Jack noted, during the quarter we launched and closed on our widely syndicated financing for Corpus Christi Stage III, raising approximately $4 billion of new capital, which was the final step needed for us to reach FID. As part of the financing, we amended and restated the CCH credit facility with 36 financial institutions, increasing total commitments by $3.7 billion to approximately $4 billion, extending the maturity by multiple years and reset the borrowing rate to SOFR plus 150. Approximately $300 million of outstanding borrowings were rolled over from the previous facility. And since closing in June, a little over $400 million was incrementally drawn as of the end of the quarter. In addition to the credit facility, we amended and restated the working capital facility at CCH, increasing commitments by $300 million to $1.5 billion extending the maturity to 2027 and reset our borrowing rate to SOFR plus 125. The working capital facility remains undrawn. We are appreciative of a long-term partnership with our global bank group that has consistently supported us through the years including on Stage III, which further highlighted Cheniere's ability to continue to develop and structure world-class infrastructure projects with brownfield economics, underpinned by lump sum turnkey EPC arrangements with Bechtel and a diverse mix of long-term creditworthy take-or-pay commercial contracts. Thanks to our financial results so far this year and the expected proceeds from the early termination of our TUA with Chevron. We continue to make progress on our comprehensive long-term capital allocation plan on a significantly accelerated schedule. Not only has our prioritization on debt paydown accelerated the deleveraging of our consolidated balance sheet, but also we are more than halfway through our three-year $1 billion share repurchase authorization in less than a year. During the quarter, we prepaid $1.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness bringing our total debt repaid or redeemed to just over $3 billion under our capital allocation plan. So, we are more than three-quarters of the way through our four-year deleveraging goal in about a year and a half years. The expected proceeds from the Chevron prepayment will likely further accelerate the pace of our deleveraging by the end of the year. In the second quarter alone, we repurchased 4.1 million shares for approximately $540 million, including approximately 2.7 million shares from Icahn Enterprises for approximately $350 million, which brought its shareholdings in Cheniere below the threshold for Board representation established in the nomination and standstill agreement that has been in place since 2015. We have also continued to declare and pay our quarterly dividend of $0.33, which we plan to grow over time now that we have completed or announced the first four quarterly payments. And finally, in terms of allocating capital to accretive growth projects, we reached FID in Corpus Christi Stage 3 and issued Bechtel full notice to proceed in June. Given this accelerated progress and our approximately $7 billion of forecasted DCF in 2022, our plans for a revised capital allocation plan have also accelerated. And we anticipate coming to The Street with an updated plan for the future before the end of the year. While robust deleveraging and reaching investment grade in the next year or so will remain a priority, you can likely expect a recalibration of allocation between debt paydown, shareholder returns and future growth on a relative basis, particularly as we continue to develop and commercialize this future growth. Turn now to Slide 14 where I will provide some more detail on our third consecutive significant increase to 2022 guidance. We are increasing the midpoint of our guidance ranges for full year 2022 consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow, each by over $1 billion, bringing expected consolidated adjusted EBITDA to $9.8 billion to $10.3 billion. Distributable cash flow of $6.9 billion to $7.4 billion. With the recent distribution announcement for CQP, we are also tracking to the high end of the $4 to $4.25 guidance range. As Jack mentioned about half of the $1.6 billion increase in EBITDA is attributable to the expected proceeds from the early termination of the TUA with Chevron set to be paid to SB LNG prior to year-end. The other half is due to curves moving higher over the balance of the year. In addition, our forecast has improved due to smaller contributing factors, such as some of the open capacity for 2022 that was previously reserved for long-term origination, being released to CMI, higher lifting margin, lower shipping costs and some third party sourcing and portfolio optimization. With respect to the EBITDA sensitivity from here, we have sold much of our total expected production for this year and have approximately 40 TBtu unsold remaining. We currently forecast that a $1 change in market margin would impact EBITDA by approximately $20 million for the rest of 2022, as we continue to reserve some unsold volume for long-term originations in Q4. 2022 continues to prove the power of the Cheniere platform and what can be achieved when operational excellence and seamless execution are combined during an elevated commodity backdrop. Thanks to our team's relentless focus on safety and reliability at both of our facilities. We continue to outperform expectations with respect to operational performance and financial results, which brings an even stronger balance sheet, increased shareholder returns, and further accretive growth into focus. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first call will be Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning.\nJack Fusco: Good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: It seems like Cheniere has been quite successful in signing up new contracts, as of late particularly with Asian buyers. And some of those contractual terms have showed that part of it is contingent on expansion beyond CCL Stage III. And so, I was just wondering, what the pace of new contracts could be? Do you see more of these coming in the near term? And are they going to be contingent on a further expansion? And if so when might we hear more about that?\nJack Fusco: Jeremy, thanks. And I can give you a little bit of color right now, if you'd like. So as you all know, strategically, we have a track record right of capitalizing on all the infrastructure and the sites that we've built. So we have executed on that strategy and expanded our portfolio by over 20 million tonnes so far over 60%, and that's Corpus 3 Sabine six and now Stage III. So I still view both sites as being excellent for major brownfield LNG expansion. So at Corpus specifically, and since you asked about the contracts Corpus is growing to just over 25 million tonnes with the addition of Stage III. We have a clear line of sight to get Corpus over 30 million tonnes on par with Sabine Pass. With the addition of a few more mid-scale trains as an expansion of Stage III, as well as some debottlenecking and tuning efforts. And so in terms of growth plans, we believe that that's the lowest paying fruit. And it's expected to be extremely cost effective, and potentially seamless with Bechtel already on site. Additionally, both at Sabine and at Corpus, both of those sites are ripe and ready for much larger expansions. So, we're currently working on early-stage developments, of over 30 million tonnes between those two sites. So as you highlighted, the energy crisis abroad has brought reliability and energy security and really the flexibility of Cheniere's LNG into sharp focus around the world, and that includes Washington. So the US LNG is rightly seen as a logical long-term balance, or a long-term solution, how balanced the shortages in Europe. And I believe that, the permitting reform that's currently being talked about in D.C. is a very positive development. It should enhance the regulatory tailwinds for well-developed commercially sound brownfield projects like ours and what we're about to propose longer term in our growth forecast. So I hope that helps.\nJeremy Tonet: Yes, that's very helpful. And I just wanted to pivot to capital allocation if I could. And I know there's a bigger update coming towards the end of the year here. But it seems like at this point Cheniere has clear line of sight to hitting targeted leverage and reach full investment grade in the not-too-distant future here. And so I just want to know process-wise, when you're thinking about buybacks, would you think of buybacks in terms of balance sheet capacity, or stock price, or think of it more in a holistic manner certain return of capital to shareholders that would be a combination of dividends and buybacks as a certain percentage of free cash flow or such?\nZach Davis: Hey Jeremy, it's Zach. And thanks for the question. I mean, it was less than a year ago we came out with capital allocation. We thought we'd have $10 billion of available cash through 2024. Maybe it's double at this point just where the curves are? And how much earlier Train six came online? So yeah, we're going to owe everyone a capital allocation plan with much bigger numbers this year, because it's just been so much more accelerated. So as we think about it, there's this pile of money and how do we break it out. And we'll definitely recalibrate to an extent the debt pay down to shareholder returns. No need for the 4:1 ratio of debt paydown to buybacks going forward. So there's going to be quite a bit of money allocated to share buybacks overtime. And as you can see, we did over $0.5 billion just in Q2 and you saw some of the dislocation there and we were really opportunistic. So you can assume that that's going to happen. There'll be a regular cadence quarterly that we will always be buying back stock, but we'll be extra aggressive whenever we see things like what happened in June.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll now move on to Marc Solecitto with Barclays.\nMarc Solecitto: Hi. Good morning. Maybe just following up on the longer-term growth outlook with respect to expansion beyond Stage 3, I want to get your latest thoughts around what the next iteration of that could look like after factoring in the recent contracts you've signed. It seems like you could potentially move forward with a larger scale train at this point or even a larger expansion with a couple more contracts. So just curious to the extent you could comment on, how you're thinking about that versus modular expansions?\nJack Fusco: Marc, hi it's Jack. I mean, the way I'm thinking about it is, I want to do whatever expansion I can do quickly and in a financially disciplined way. And right now, for us, it looks like adding to the mid-scale trains, we can do very quickly with -- and economically hit all of our financial metrics. And rather than get caught up in a long-term regulatory review of our large-scale expansion. So my first goal is to just grab all the low-hanging fruit that we possibly can right now today. And then, make sure we're filing and being respectful in those filings of what the longer-term expansion plans are for both sites. And that's near-term also. But I just think there's -- we have an opportunity to add to our growth plans in a very effective way and we need to take advantage of it.\nMarc Solecitto: Thanks Jack. It's very helpful. And then with respect to Europe, curious how your discussions with customers there have gone and whether with the most recent curtailment of volumes on Nord Stream and reescalation and gas prices has that at all changed some of the discussions over the past month or so?\nAnatol Feygin: Yeah. Thanks Marc. This is Anatol chiming in. The discussions have been very robust for the better part of the year, really in the market broadly and Europe obviously the tragic events that played out at the beginning of the year and continue to play out does add sense of urgency. You've seen us do transactions with Equinor NG those are transactions that we think probably would have gotten done anyway, but perhaps were done sooner. And then, of course, on the Europe front there is a tremendous push to add infrastructure to debottleneck, regas infrastructure running at well over 80%, and now will grow most likely by about 50%. And even given our business model and the transactions we enter into again with the Equinors, the Chevrons of the world, et cetera can all serve European demand. So, kind of, like a lot of the things you hear from us it's all of the above and we continue to be very well engaged. And to Jeremy's question, we do see continued great opportunity to support Asia's growth not just to help rebalance Europe.\nMarc Solecitto: Got it. Thanks for your time.\nOperator: Thank you. And next we'll move on to Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Hi, good morning. I want to ask any detailed questions about the EPA thing. I know it's kind of a sensitive situation. But I am just wondering, if we should expect a resolution on it before the 180-day mark, which is coming up in a few weeks?\nJack Fusco: Maybe Jean Ann is there because -- and I just want to say look I've worked in and around the EPA for well over my 40-year career. And I'm very familiar with the EPA their processes and what their expectations are. As I talked about on my speaking remarks, we've been testing the turbines with Baker Hughes at our side. Bakers or turbine OEM to try to make sure that we provide the data that they want by the September 5th date. I have to say being an own performance engineer from my days at PG&E back in the 1980s, the testing procedure in itself is very difficult. It relies heavily on correlations and calculations and estimates and guesstimates of the formation of formaldehyde. So we're working closely with the EPA as we're talking just working on what an accessible test program looks like, and what the shortcomings are from that program in and of itself. And as you know from your comments, 91 parts per one billion is an awful small number and very difficult to measure at least with today's technology. But we will continue to work closely with the EPA. And I think ultimately the situation is manageable. I think the solutions will be immaterial to Cheniere both from an operational perspective and a financial perspective.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Great. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, what do you view as the maximum amount of US LNG liquefaction that the US could realistically build, concurrently over the next four or five years? And what sets that liquefaction? It's obviously, a very big talking point in the market right now, and you guys know more than pretty much anyone. So, interested in your opinion there. \nJack Fusco: In the next four or five years, Anatol, what's the maximum amount that US can build? \nAnatol Feygin: Yes. So, Jean Ann, I will admit that the answer to that question has changed modestly over the last six months. And it is probably higher today, than we would have put it into our base case. But the constraints have changed and the constraints are very different today. As we said, the way we prosecute these projects with lump sum turnkey, commercial support, gas supply solutions, all of those boxes checked, on a disciplined and attractive risk-adjusted basis. Those boxes are getting more difficult to check, right? The commercialization issue, which was a key gating factor two or three years ago obviously, year-to-date less so with well over 30 million tonnes of SPA signed by US projects, and other 20-plus million tonnes of HOAs. That is not the gating factor, but running the gauntlet on all these other pieces and having the EPC economics that support that commercialization. Zach's prowess in financing these things, is not that widely distributed and the gas supply solutions that our guys come up with are becoming more and more difficult. So, all those issues are going to be the limiting factor.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Great, Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll move on to Brian Reynolds with UBS. \nBrian Reynolds: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Looking at 2022 guidance seems like $10 billion is roughly the right number to end the year for EBITDA. But when looking ahead at 2023, it seems like the CMI margin opportunity has expanded, just given the roll forward in hedging and strengthen prices relative to 2022 EBITDA. So I was kind of just wondering, if you could talk high level about some of the moving pieces, when considering what's changing in terms of stock contracts and CMI capacity, as we look ahead into 2023 versus 2022? Thanks.\nZach Davis: Sure. This is Zach. And you know, full well we don't really give guidance on 2023, until the November call. So that's coming in a couple of months. But what I can say is that, we're comfortably over 90% contracted on our nine trains, plus Stage III at this point through the mid-2030s. And for the next decade, we're on average 95% contracted across everything. However, considering a few of the remaining contracts, aren't going to stand up or start until 2023 or even early 2024. There is actually a reasonable amount of open capacity next year, especially in the first half before most of these contracts, that still haven't started yet, related to the first nine trains begin. But that's not to say we're not still comfortably over 90% even next year. But if you look at the curves, and on average for the rest of this year, next year, high 20s if not better, we're comfortably confident that we can beat the $5.5 billion of run rate EBITDA on nine trains again next year. So it could be a really strong year, before 2024 or so, where we're almost fully contracted on the nine trains until Stage 3 ramps up in 2025, 2026 and then we have a little more open capacity again. \nBrian Reynolds: Great. I appreciate all that incremental color. Maybe just a follow-up on the CCL Stage 3. I know you've gotten a few questions on this already. But just kind of curious if you can talk about brownfield expansions like with mid-scale at existing CCL Stage 3 and Sabine that would limit the regulatory approval versus like permitting a whole new site and going back to FERC which is -- it seems like the long-term plan at this point. But is there anything in the interim on the mid-scale perspective at CCL Stage 3 or Sabine that could potentially be brought online earlier just given that you already have almost three MCP contracts signed? Thanks.\nJack Fusco: Yes. No, we are FERC-regulated site. So, it doesn't matter what technology -- and in fact it doesn't matter what we do, we always go back to FERC and then FEMSA and now the EPA. So, I didn't want to mislead you on that aspect of it. There -- the degree of difficulty in my opinion is different from doing a modular expansion to a whole new large scale, large train construction program as far as getting through FERC and the engineering required. So, since we've already engineered and got fully permitted seven trains -- mid-scale trains, it should be significantly easier to just add to those seven trains and punch amount but it still requires FERC approval. \nBrian Reynolds: Great. Appreciate the color. Have a great rest of the morning.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we move on to Matt Taylor with Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. \nMatt Taylor: Yes, thanks for taking my questions here. I wanted to go back to Euronet in terms of behavior there as we're seeing a lot of those Western European countries can be really focused on getting through the winter here. So, I guess the question here is have you seen structural change in that behavior meaning should we expect to see interest? Like you said it's already picked up, but interest picking up even once we get to next year or are you still seeing LNG imports being viewed as a short-term measure to backfill Russian gas before turning back to say mothball baseload generation so that they can support renewable development?\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Thanks Matt. The first step in solving this crisis that Europe has pursued very aggressively is the infrastructure solutions. The issue of lining up contractual long-term molecules for those infrastructure solutions is something that has been somewhat successful, let's say, and something that will we think be largely intermediated. So, the support that the market will get from the IOCs intermediating these issues is clearly what you're seeing in the Chevron, Exxon, even Equinor transactions that have been executed lately as well as some European customers. Again the NGs and the ENBW, for example, that was done with another project falls into that bucket. But you really can't get away from the fact that demand growth and real sort of underlying increase for LNG imports is going to be driven by Asia into the 40s and 50s. And the fact that we now have deals that go into the late 40s and into the early 50s from that theater, really support that. So that's the balancing act. But, of course, the flexibility and reliability of our products will go to the market of most need as it has for over 70% of our volume to-date.\nMatt Taylor: Great. Thanks for that. And maybe as a follow-up to that then, we're starting to see longer-term contracting on those regas terminals. So, is that something that acquiring or building those types of assets? Would that fit your risk-reward preferences and you guys get involved on the debottlenecking of infrastructure in Europe? I mean Sabine was previously an import facility.\nAnatol Feygin: I guess to -- the short answer to that is, we'll have at least 60% if not 90 and maybe even more million tonnes of additional European import capacity really without our involvement. So we're happy to look at things. We, obviously, are in the market, but to-date that hasn't required our participation. And frankly, we don't expect it to going forward.\nJack Fusco: It hasn't slowed us down at all on our growth plans.\nMatt Taylor: Great. Thanks for taking my question.\nOperator: Thank you. And next we'll move on to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Lapides: Nice try. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I actually have a couple. One, Jack, just curious -- actually this is the first one is for Jack. Second one is probably for a combo of Jack and Anatol. The first one just on the knee cap issue. Is there anything that your team is saying to you that would keep you in the EPA book state in federal from entering consent decrees that give you a lot of time to come into compliance if coming in the compliance is required?\nJack Fusco: Yes. I mean that would be the logical next step. If we could not get a subcategory and get a stay on our turbines, which is what we believe is -- would be the correct thing for the EPA to do since this rule was in place in really 2003, 2004, and our facility was approved in 2011, that we think it makes sense for them to put us in a subcategory. But if not, we would go into negotiations, some type of consent degree, most logically with the state agency, which in our case would be Louisiana, LDEQ, and we would go from there just like we have many times before. And like I said Michael, I have in my career many, many times.\nMichael Lapides: Got it, okay. And then, a long-term question. And this is just -- when you're talking account our parties and especially, the utilities in Asia. What are they saying to you these days, just given what's happened to global gas prices about the future of their coal generation fleets?\nJack Fusco: Well, I'll give you my perspective first and then, Anatol can chime in. Like Anatol says, we track all the natural gas infrastructure being built around the world. And I think the last time and last thing, I saw from Anatol's team was around $1.3 trillion of nat gas infrastructure that's currently being built. And most of that is in Asia. I think a very small amount of that is in Europe with the FSRUs that they're currently trying to build and the interconnections into their gas pipelines, but most of that $1 trillion is in Asia. Our conversations have gone very smoothly because of our reliability. And it\u2019s not an accident that I touched upon it in the presentation. It has been a competitive advantage for Anatol and his team to go sit across the table and say, \"Look, we haven't missed a foundation customer cargo\". And if your building is power plant, don't you want to have a reliable source of natural gas for that combined cycle power plant. And those conversations have went very well, which is why Anatol highlighted the fact that PetroChina is already into the 2050 with us on their contracted amounts. So they really do see the value proposition of a long-term Henry Hub based contract. \nAnatol Feygin: And just to build on that, unfortunately, the way Europe has set up its market, the pain of these very high prices is very broadly felt. The way that Asia, most of Asia has set up its market, those prices are largely irrelevant, right? Our friends at CPC are largely immune from these prices and pay a long-term contractual price that is much less volatile and much lower. And that's really what Asia is relying on. And as we look across and think about, as you do about demand destruction and the implications of these high prices. A, we're not seeing anything, right? The commitment is to not build any more coal plants, retire coal plants continue to import more LNG continue to develop more gas-fired generation, really haven't changed over the last couple of years. And one of the large reasons for that, as Jack said, is we supply a fundamentally much less volatile, very reliable and these days much lower-priced products. And the coal alternative is even economically not attractive, much less environmentally. So that's one of the many reasons why we're still so sanguine on Asian gas and LNG demand growth for decades to come.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. And if you don't mind one last one and this is probably for Zach. Zach, just curious, when you think about any open capacity, whether it's in first half of 2023 or first had winter of 2023 2024, how liquid or how deep is the market? Like, if you wanted to go ahead and start locking in, call it, winter of 2023, 2024 for any open or uncontracted cargoes. Can you actually go ahead and do that pretty easily right now, or do you have to wait till you get closer to prompt months, prompt delivery for doing that?\nZach Davis: I mean, the team is selling what it can for the rest of this year into the winter and in the first half of next year, physically. And that's even trying at times with all the volatility that we're seeing. But to put in perspective financially to hedge out over a year, that's not really realistic to be done right now. I mean, 18 months ago early last year, you might have to reserve, I don't know, $15 million, $20 million, $25 million to lock in a $3 margin on a cargo for the prompt month. That's now $300 million with the volatility doubling since then. And if you can go out six months, you're almost talking about $1 billion. So financially hedging out all that far is not really realistic or tenable. So we've been most successful on locking in on a Henry Hub plus basis, or just on a fixed price basis. And what we're doing is really, reducing any liquidity risk and taking on likely more credit risk, but that's why, even on the short-term book these days, it's just as essential working with IG counterparties that are reliable or those that can post enhanced credit support upfront.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.\nJack Fusco: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. Actually, we will now be taking our last question today from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: Thank you. Good morning everyone. So you're clearly going to be adding a lot of capacity in the future here. I'm curious for your latest views on construction costs. I know in the past I think you've talked about per tonne range. But is that -- does that still make sense? And I guess on a related note, can you talk about the cadence of Stage 3 CapEx over the next few years?\nJack Fusco : Yes. So I'll take part of that question and then I'll turn it over to Zach. We have an extremely strong relationship with Bechtel. They built our first nine trains. We had early meetings with Bechtel. We locked in on some of our major equipment with our major equipment suppliers with Bechtel early to help manage the inflation and then Bechtel did a full wrap on Stage 3. We saw some inflation, but it was manageable and a relatively small number on Stage 3. A lot of that is the design, since it's smaller trains. It uses a lot less nine nickel steel than some of the larger trains the five million-tonne trains. Our Stage 3 trains are 1.5 million of train. And in that case, they use more aluminum, less mine nickel and aluminum prices haven't escalated as much and we were able to lock in those prices and still get within that $700 a tonne range. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Zach.\nZach Davis : Right. I think just locking in the contract and doing that aluminous know [ph] procedure even in early March, huge advantage to us that probably set Stage 3 apart from most other projects that are trying to get done this year. And as Jack mentioned that $600 to $700 a tonne on an unlevered basis that's correct. That's including contingency the six times CapEx to run rate EBITDA of, let's say, one 1 billion to one two billion that's good too. And that's where we stand today. And if you think about our financing we raised 50% leverage on it. So it goes a little over $7 billion when you add the interest costs and the financing fees that's SOFR plus 150 so less than 4% funding. We're going to delay draw that over time with equity. So it's about $800 million a year for debt and equity on average through construction. \nMichael Blum : Got it. Very helpful. And then just one other really quick one. O&M expense at CQP was up, I think, like 12% sequentially this quarter. I'm assuming that's just Train 6 being fully in service, but I want to confirm that and also just ask if that's kind of the new run rate? Thanks.\nZach Davis : Yes. I think you got it. That Train 6 for a full quarter. There was a little extra maintenance so it can go up and down quarter-to-quarter, but that's about right. And that's why you saw the O&M be up a bit this quarter.\nMichael Blum : Great. Thank you.\nJack Fusco : Well, thank you everybody. We appreciate your support and stay tuned.\nOperator: Thank you so much. And that does conclude today's teleconference. We do appreciate your participation. At this time you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Anatol Feygin",
            "content": "Thanks, Jack and good morning everyone. Please turn to slide 9. As everyone is aware, the energy world has been caught in a mail stream of geopolitical and macroeconomic events that are feeding volatility and heightening uncertainty in the market. All of which have had consequential impacts on supply, trade patterns and consumer behavior across energy commodities. Amid this volatility, total LNG demand continue to grow, albeit constrained by lack of new supply and sustained elevated prices, undoubtedly contributing to the record amount of commercial activity in the second quarter. After a brief pullback in LNG spot prices in the second quarter, we've seen concerns over the dependability of Russian pipeline supply, plus numerous LNG supply issues pushed JKM and TTF forward curves back into the $40 to $50 an MMBtu range through the coming winter, pushing European electricity prices to record highs. JKM prompt month futures continue to trade at a discount to TTF during the quarter, as Europe priced cargoes away from Asia and this discount has widened as a result of further cuts to gas flows into Europe in recent weeks. During the quarter, we saw pipeline imports from Russia into Europe, excluding Turkey continued to fall, reaching modern aero lows of just over 5.5 Bcf a day in June, prior to Nord Streams annual maintenance period. US LNG imports into Europe excluding Turkey again surpassed Russian pipeline volumes for the first time in June and again in July. On the LNG side there have also been several supply disruptions as well as seasonal maintenance activities which have also acted to tighten the market. The outage at Freeport LNG has removed the equivalent of approximately 2 Bcf a day of LNG from the market. Industrial action at Shell's Prelude beginning June 10 slowed production and resulted in a shutdown beginning around July 11, which remains idle as of early August. And the restart of Norway's Hammerfest LNG which had been offline since September of 2020 was delayed to early June. Several other projects in Angola the US and Indonesia also underwent routine planned maintenance as expected in the shoulder months tightening the market further. Despite the supply challenges in LNG a recovery from below average production during the same period in 2021 contributed to a 7% year-over-year increase in global LNG exports which reached 100 million tonnes in the second quarter consistent with the previous two quarters. The US alone exported 19.6 million tonnes in the second quarter up 12% or 2.1 million tonnes year-on-year due in large part to additional capacity online at SPL Train 6. While the US was the largest LNG exporter in the first half of the year total exported volume declined modestly in the second quarter due primarily to planned maintenance and Freeport's outage. Finally, in the US gas market although Henry Hub prices have also recently touched new multiyear highs domestic prices are still well below the relative spikes in both JKM and TTF. The July contract settled at $6.55 an M [ph] down 26% relative to the June contract as supply increased and demand moderated in early June loosening the US gas balance. Since then, prices have moved up again on an unprecedented early summer heat. We're seeing a response to the price signal in the rig count as gas-directed rigs in the US are up approximately 50% year-over-year to 157 rigs. So, we would expect gas production to increase from current levels in the near future. Please turn to slide 10 for more detail on gas and LNG supply and demand in Europe and Asia. As discussed, the global LNG market remained tight in the second quarter despite winter coming to an end and a notable decline in Chinese imports. Consumers continue to endure high spot prices for natural gas especially in Europe given the reduction in Russian gas flows. During the quarter LNG deliveries to Europe climbed 40% year-on-year with volumes from the US increasing by nearly 130% year-on-year including flows from Cheniere which also increased by over 130%. Nevertheless, risks of further cuts to Russian flows continue to rise maintaining upward pressure on prices. In mid-June Nord Stream flows were reduced to approximately 40% of the capacity. And following the end of the quarter the scheduled maintenance reduced close to zero from July 11 to 20. Flows initially resumed the premaintenance levels but have since fallen to 20% of capacity. Amid these risks and high prices Germany raised its gas emergency plan to alert level while the European Commission proposed measures to reduce gas use in Europe by 15% until next spring. In the meantime, Europe continues to fast-track plans to increase LNG import capacity by over 50% to approximately 280 million tonnes per annum and has already sanctioned 11 new regas terminals representing approximately 40 million tonnes per annum just in the first half of this year. In Asia LNG demand declined about 5% in the second quarter most of which was attributable to economic headwinds in China. The country's GDP growth rate decelerated to 0.4% in the second quarter from 4.8% in the first. Shanghai the largest financial hub in the country endured strict COVID lockdowns, which was a contributing factor to a year-over-year decline in China's absolute GDP during Q2. Gas demand in the country fell 8% as a result, as city gas and power sector consumption contracted. Elsewhere in Asia, overall, demand growth was somewhat flat, although, we observed improved demand in JKT and Thailand. Nuclear power generation in Japan was down year-on-year, which led to a 9% increase in LNG imports, while maintenance of coal-fired power plants in Korea sustained existing LNG import levels. Thailand continued to exhibit LNG demand strength as higher consumption requirements offset its dwindling domestic production. The relative weakness in Asia year-to-date has counterbalanced the heightened demand in Europe, but we expect this to be a transient phenomenon with near-term weather and longer-term organic growth confirming that long-term fundamentals in Asia remains strong with ample upside potential. This view is underscored by the demonstrated appetite for long-term LNG volumes exhibited by Asian customers this quarter, including our recently announced long-term contracts with POSCO, PetroChina and PTT. Please turn to Slide 11. Needless to say, the impact of Europe's energy crisis have already been far reaching, with significant consequences observed across multiple sectors of the economy, including food and commodities. This backdrop has exposed some vulnerabilities within gas and LNG markets around the world not just in Europe and has accelerated the impetus for gas consumers to secure reliable long-term LNG supply. In the first half of 2022, buyers around the world signed nearly 38 million tonnes per annum of firm long-term contracts globally, the highest level since at least 2016. Most of these from contracts or 28 MTPA were signed with US sellers potentially underpinning a new round of LNG infrastructure investment in the US. In just the first seven months of 2022, we have already had our most productive year for long-term contracting since 2011 continuing to successfully grow our portfolio of diverse creditworthy customers. The long-term deals we concluded, completed the commercialization of Stage III. And as Jack mentioned, LNG buyers have already begun to contract to our next phase of growth. Our commercial success further cements our position as the LNG provider of choice for buyers worldwide. Since just the start of the second quarter, we executed long-term transactions with FOB, DES and IPM structures with creditworthy counterparties from Asia, Europe, Canada and the US super major. This geographic and structural diversity is a prime illustration of the value of the Cheniere brand that Jack referenced and what sets Cheniere apart. The certainty on execution, the safe and reliable operations and our unrivaled ability to structure long-term energy solutions tailored to fit the needs and preferences of a diverse global customer base. On the buyer side, you can see from the middle chart that a greater variety of buyer types are contracting for US LNG given the stability and flexibility Gulf Coast FOB volumes can provide for their portfolios. While portfolio players still represent a significant portion of US LNG buyers or prospective buyers, we observed that the end user segment has also been growing, including those potentially servicing Europe. Finally, while Europe's target to displace Russian gas certainly creates a near-term increase in LNG demand, you can see from the chart on the right that credible commentators are forecasting this heightened demand to persist despite expectations for the region to reduce its overall gas demand over that same period. This uncertainty highlights Europe and the world's need for flexibility and reliability of supply to highly valued attributes of the long-term product we offer. Our conviction in the long-term global market fundamentals for our products remain as strong as ever, and our demonstrated ability to construct LNG solutions tailored to customers across the globe places Cheniere in an ideal position to continue to win business and grow our market-leading LNG platform for many years to come. And now I'll turn the call over to Zach to review our financial results and guidance. Yeah. Thanks Marc. This is Anatol chiming in. The discussions have been very robust for the better part of the year, really in the market broadly and Europe obviously the tragic events that played out at the beginning of the year and continue to play out does add sense of urgency. You've seen us do transactions with Equinor NG those are transactions that we think probably would have gotten done anyway, but perhaps were done sooner. And then, of course, on the Europe front there is a tremendous push to add infrastructure to debottleneck, regas infrastructure running at well over 80%, and now will grow most likely by about 50%. And even given our business model and the transactions we enter into again with the Equinors, the Chevrons of the world, et cetera can all serve European demand. So, kind of, like a lot of the things you hear from us it's all of the above and we continue to be very well engaged. And to Jeremy's question, we do see continued great opportunity to support Asia's growth not just to help rebalance Europe. Yes. So, Jean Ann, I will admit that the answer to that question has changed modestly over the last six months. And it is probably higher today, than we would have put it into our base case. But the constraints have changed and the constraints are very different today. As we said, the way we prosecute these projects with lump sum turnkey, commercial support, gas supply solutions, all of those boxes checked, on a disciplined and attractive risk-adjusted basis. Those boxes are getting more difficult to check, right? The commercialization issue, which was a key gating factor two or three years ago obviously, year-to-date less so with well over 30 million tonnes of SPA signed by US projects, and other 20-plus million tonnes of HOAs. That is not the gating factor, but running the gauntlet on all these other pieces and having the EPC economics that support that commercialization. Zach's prowess in financing these things, is not that widely distributed and the gas supply solutions that our guys come up with are becoming more and more difficult. So, all those issues are going to be the limiting factor. Yes. Thanks Matt. The first step in solving this crisis that Europe has pursued very aggressively is the infrastructure solutions.

But, of course, the flexibility and reliability of our products will go to the market of most need as it has for over 70% of our volume to-date. I guess to -- the short answer to that is, we'll have at least 60% if not 90 and maybe even more million tonnes of additional European import capacity really without our involvement. So we're happy to look at things. We, obviously, are in the market, but to-date that hasn't required our participation. And frankly, we don't expect it to going forward. And just to build on that, unfortunately, the way Europe has set up its market, the pain of these very high prices is very broadly felt. The way that Asia, most of Asia has set up its market, those prices are largely irrelevant, right? Our friends at CPC are largely immune from these prices and pay a long-term contractual price that is much less volatile and much lower. And that's really what Asia is relying on.

            "content": "Thank you Randy. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today and thank you all for your continued support of Cheniere. I'm pleased to be here this morning to review our second quarter 2022 achievements and discuss our 2022 positive outlook. The second quarter achievements were highlighted by the positive FID of Corpus Christi Stage III earlier this summer. In June, we issued a full notice to proceed to Bechtel, which had already commenced early construction under a limited notice to proceed earlier this year. The strategy of releasing Bechtel under limited notice to proceed ahead of a full FID continues to pay dividends as it locks in schedule and cost, which is especially important in today's inflationary environment. We are excited to move forward on this highly economic growth project, which will strengthen our market-leading LNG infrastructure platform and provide much needed LNG to the global market. The FID of Stage III is a milestone. The entire Cheniere workforce should be proud of as it was made possible by everyone's dedicated and tireless efforts to bring this project to fruition. Over the last decade, Cheniere has set the bar on safety and project execution and we look forward to continuing those results with Stage III. Please turn to slide 5 where I will review some of the key operational financial and strategic highlights from what was a very busy and successful quarter as well as introduce our upwardly revised financial guidance ranges for the full year. For the second quarter, we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.5 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $1.9 billion as margins in the LNG market remains significantly above historical norms and our focus on operational excellence continue to be rewarded. Our EBITDA and cash flow metrics for the second quarter both exceeded what we achieved in the first half of 2021, a powerful illustration of the impact of world-class execution and safe, reliable operations, which have become synonymous with the Cheniere brand. The energy crisis in Europe continues to evolve and it is at the center of a tragic and devastating war. The United States is blessed with an abundance of low-cost natural gas and I am proud that our collective efforts at Cheniere are having a direct and positive impact on the lives of so many people around the world. We produced loaded and exported 156 cargoes in the second quarter, as our operations benefited from the full quarter of operations of Train 6 at Sabine Pass. As of the end of the second quarter, nearly 225 cargoes of LNG, which is over 70% of the cargoes produced at our facilities so far this year have landed in Europe. By comparison, in the first half of last year, less than 40% of the cargoes produced by Cheniere landed in Europe. Clearly, the benefits of the flexibility inherent in the commercial structures of our contracts are on display. That is enabling the LNG we produce to reach the markets with the greatest need. For the third quarter in a row, our guidance ranges for 2022 are moving higher by over $1 billion. We now forecast consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $9.8 billion to $10.3 billion and distributable cash flow of $6.9 billion to $7.4 billion. Thanks to the expected lump sum payment by Chevron under the termination of the regasification EUA and marketing margins moving higher compared to our prior forecast. Zach will address guidance in more detail in his comments in a few minutes. On the marketing origination front Anatol and his team have been racking up frequent flier miles and bringing home more long-term contracts with customers around the world looking to secure long-term reliable supplies of LNG in support of energy security and energy transition. Just since the start of the second quarter and through July, we have entered into long-term contracts aggregating approximately 140 million tonnes through 2030, since our first quarter earnings call. We announced long-term SPAs with POSCO International, Equinor, Chevron, PetroChina and PTT. All of these contracts extended beyond 2040 and the PetroChina SPA is our first LNG contract that extends into the second half of this century. Over the last 12 months we have signed SPAs and IPM deals aggregating up to approximately 15 million tonnes per annum and up to over 240 million tonnes in aggregate. The contracts with Equinor, Chevron and PetroChina each contain a provision where the long-term contracted firm volume will double either once we make a positive FID on liquefaction capacity expansions at Corpus Christi beyond Stage III or we unilaterally commit to the volume. So after reaching FID on Stage III only weeks ago, we've already sold an incremental almost three million tonnes per annum of volume beyond Stage III. Those contracts clearly demonstrate the demand in the market and my leadership team and I are very focused on Cheniere's next phase of growth. The investments we made at Sabine Pass in Corpus Christi over the last decade provide both of those sites with significant brownfield expansion opportunities and you can be certain we're pursuing growth at both facilities. At Corpus Christi, we see a number of potential ways to leverage the infrastructure we've built or are building to add economically advantaged LNG capacity from a smaller scale edition that could conceivably be done faster all the way to a very large expansion on the land adjacent to Stage III we've shown you in the past.  At Sabine Pass, with our third birth nearing completion, infrastructure hurdles to expanding SPL are being cleared and we are currently developing plans for a potentially significant expansion of that facility as well. Later this year, I look forward to providing more detail on our growth plans at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi as we move into the regulatory process and communicating our enhanced capital allocation plans for the coming years. Turn now to slide six. On these calls, you've heard me talk about our operational excellence program. That program establishes the key operating philosophy of Cheniere of which safety, reliability, and efficiency form the foundation. That program ensures safe operations and maintenance of our facilities, while maximizing production and efficiency. While always one of my key priorities, operational reliability has become a key focus of those outside Cheniere as well, especially with high LNG market prices in Europe in the midst of an energy crisis. First and foremost, with respect to safety, we have a safety-first culture at Cheniere and I'm extremely proud that our safety record demonstrates that. On the bottom of slide six, the graph shows our total recordable incident rate, the preeminent safety metric of an operating facility, and a metric that is part of the compensation calculation for each and every Cheniere employee. You can see that not only have we exhibited consistent improvement over the course of last year during which we commissioned and started commercial operations of Train 6, but also that Cheniere's performance on this metric is comfortably within our industry's top quartile. Safety and reliability go hand-in-hand. It signifies an employee's ownership in the facility, a strong safety metric and operations typically leads to reliable operations of the facility. The middle of the slide shows our facility utilization since 2021 which is yielding production consistent with our run rate range of 4.9 million to 5.1 million tonnes per annum per train. Our utilization is consistently above 90% compares favorably to the 2021 global average of about 80% and demonstrates the value of our operational excellence program. I tell our operations leadership team that safety is an investment not an expense and the return on that safety investment is clearly in the results we reported this morning. Turn now to slide seven. We'll highlight two significant milestones recently achieved with respect to our ESG and Climate and Sustainability initiatives that demonstrates Cheniere's leadership position in these areas. First during the second quarter, we commenced providing our cargo emission tags or CE tags to our long-term customers. These tags are the first of its kind innovation in our industry and provide our customers with the estimated greenhouse gas emission profile of each LNG cargo from the wellhead to the cargo delivery point. The data on the tag is calculated utilizing our proprietary life cycle analysis, improving the accuracy of the emissions data relative to industry estimates. Cheniere CE tags are a tangible result of our prioritization of data-driven environmental transparency. We expect the tags will help identify opportunities to quantify and improve environmental performance throughout the LNG supply chain. In addition, in June, we published our third annual corporate responsibility report entitled Acting Today Securing Tomorrow. I am proud of the continued progress we are able to detail in these annual reports. As Cheniere is emerging as a leader in ESG for natural gas companies, with a focus on being actionable not aspirational. On that note, I want to take a moment to address some of the recent news and speculation regarding Cheniere, the EPA and the National Emission Standards for hazardous air floods, our niche shape rule. The EPA recently lifted a near two decades stay of that rule covering the types of turbines which we utilize at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi. At Cheniere, regulatory compliance is a strategic priority. Consistent with our ESG focus on being actionable, our company values and our commitment as a responsible operator. We work constructively with federal state and local regulatory authorities to ensure prudent operations in compliance with current regulatory requirements. We value the fact that we operate under a regulatory regime in this country that seeks and values input from the industry. And we have been in touch with the EPA, regarding our concerns with respect to the rule. Currently, we are working diligently at our facilities to perform the initial testing required by the nice shop [ph]. While we don't believe our turbine should be subject to the rule as the use in LNG operations was not contemplated by EPA in the original 2003 rule making, we will work with the EPA and the relevant state agencies to develop an acceptable path forward to compliance if applicable. At this time, it is too early to discuss what, if any specific changes would be needed. However, we are confident that if necessary would be able to develop a solution that would enable compliance without a material financial or production impact. My conviction in Cheniere's LNG platform has never been stronger. We look forward to continuing to lead the LNG industry in terms of safety, operational excellence and environmental transparency in order to provide the world with a cleaner more secure and reliable energy solution. Thank you, all again for your continued support of Cheniere. I will now turn the call over to Anatol, who will provide an update on the LNG market. Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy, thanks. And I can give you a little bit of color right now, if you'd like. So as you all know, strategically, we have a track record right of capitalizing on all the infrastructure and the sites that we've built. So we have executed on that strategy and expanded our portfolio by over 20 million tonnes so far over 60%, and that's Corpus 3 Sabine six and now Stage III. So I still view both sites as being excellent for major brownfield LNG expansion. So at Corpus specifically, and since you asked about the contracts Corpus is growing to just over 25 million tonnes with the addition of Stage III. We have a clear line of sight to get Corpus over 30 million tonnes on par with Sabine Pass. With the addition of a few more mid-scale trains as an expansion of Stage III, as well as some debottlenecking and tuning efforts. And so in terms of growth plans, we believe that that's the lowest paying fruit. And it's expected to be extremely cost effective, and potentially seamless with Bechtel already on site. Additionally, both at Sabine and at Corpus, both of those sites are ripe and ready for much larger expansions. So, we're currently working on early-stage developments, of over 30 million tonnes between those two sites. So as you highlighted, the energy crisis abroad has brought reliability and energy security and really the flexibility of Cheniere's LNG into sharp focus around the world, and that includes Washington. So the US LNG is rightly seen as a logical long-term balance, or a long-term solution, how balanced the shortages in Europe. And I believe that, the permitting reform that's currently being talked about in D.C. is a very positive development. It should enhance the regulatory tailwinds for well-developed commercially sound brownfield projects like ours and what we're about to propose longer term in our growth forecast. So I hope that helps. Marc, hi it's Jack. I mean, the way I'm thinking about it is, I want to do whatever expansion I can do quickly and in a financially disciplined way. And right now, for us, it looks like adding to the mid-scale trains, we can do very quickly with -- and economically hit all of our financial metrics. And rather than get caught up in a long-term regulatory review of our large-scale expansion. So my first goal is to just grab all the low-hanging fruit that we possibly can right now today. And then, make sure we're filing and being respectful in those filings of what the longer-term expansion plans are for both sites. And that's near-term also. But I just think there's -- we have an opportunity to add to our growth plans in a very effective way and we need to take advantage of it. Maybe Jean Ann is there because -- and I just want to say look I've worked in and around the EPA for well over my 40-year career. And I'm very familiar with the EPA their processes and what their expectations are. As I talked about on my speaking remarks, we've been testing the turbines with Baker Hughes at our side. Bakers or turbine OEM to try to make sure that we provide the data that they want by the September 5th date. I have to say being an own performance engineer from my days at PG&E back in the 1980s, the testing procedure in itself is very difficult. It relies heavily on correlations and calculations and estimates and guesstimates of the formation of formaldehyde. So we're working closely with the EPA as we're talking just working on what an accessible test program looks like, and what the shortcomings are from that program in and of itself. And as you know from your comments, 91 parts per one billion is an awful small number and very difficult to measure at least with today's technology. But we will continue to work closely with the EPA. And I think ultimately the situation is manageable. I think the solutions will be immaterial to Cheniere both from an operational perspective and a financial perspective. In the next four or five years, Anatol, what's the maximum amount that US can build? Yes. No, we are FERC-regulated site. So, it doesn't matter what technology -- and in fact it doesn't matter what we do, we always go back to FERC and then FEMSA and now the EPA. So, I didn't want to mislead you on that aspect of it. There -- the degree of difficulty in my opinion is different from doing a modular expansion to a whole new large scale, large train construction program as far as getting through FERC and the engineering required. So, since we've already engineered and got fully permitted seven trains -- mid-scale trains, it should be significantly easier to just add to those seven trains and punch amount but it still requires FERC approval. It hasn't slowed us down at all on our growth plans. Yes. I mean that would be the logical next step. If we could not get a subcategory and get a stay on our turbines, which is what we believe is -- would be the correct thing for the EPA to do since this rule was in place in really 2003, 2004, and our facility was approved in 2011, that we think it makes sense for them to put us in a subcategory. But if not, we would go into negotiations, some type of consent degree, most logically with the state agency, which in our case would be Louisiana, LDEQ, and we would go from there just like we have many times before. And like I said Michael, I have in my career many, many times. Well, I'll give you my perspective first and then, Anatol can chime in. Like Anatol says, we track all the natural gas infrastructure being built around the world. And I think the last time and last thing, I saw from Anatol's team was around $1.3 trillion of nat gas infrastructure that's currently being built. And most of that is in Asia. I think a very small amount of that is in Europe with the FSRUs that they're currently trying to build and the interconnections into their gas pipelines, but most of that $1 trillion is in Asia. Our conversations have gone very smoothly because of our reliability. And it's not an accident that I touched upon it in the presentation. It has been a competitive advantage for Anatol and his team to go sit across the table and say, \"Look, we haven't missed a foundation customer cargo\". And if your building is power plant, don't you want to have a reliable source of natural gas for that combined cycle power plant. And those conversations have went very well, which is why Anatol highlighted the fact that PetroChina is already into the 2050 with us on their contracted amounts. So they really do see the value proposition of a long-term Henry Hub based contract. Thanks, Michael. Yes. So I'll take part of that question and then I'll turn it over to Zach. We have an extremely strong relationship with Bechtel. They built our first nine trains. We had early meetings with Bechtel. We locked in on some of our major equipment with our major equipment suppliers with Bechtel early to help manage the inflation and then Bechtel did a full wrap on Stage 3. We saw some inflation, but it was manageable and a relatively small number on Stage 3. A lot of that is the design, since it's smaller trains. It uses a lot less nine nickel steel than some of the larger trains the five million-tonne trains. Our Stage 3 trains are 1.5 million of train. And in that case, they use more aluminum, less mine nickel and aluminum prices haven't escalated as much and we were able to lock in those prices and still get within that $700 a tonne range. With that, I'll turn it over to Zach. Well, thank you everybody. We appreciate your support and stay tuned."

            "name": "Zach Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Anatol and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our second quarter 2022 financial results, our key financial accomplishments and our increased 2022 guidance, all of which reflects the hard work and dedication of the Cheniere team, the reliability of our platform and the volatile state of the global energy markets Anatol just described. Turning to Slide 13. During the second quarter, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $2.5 billion, distributable cash flow of approximately $1.9 billion and net income of over $700 million. Our second quarter results once again were driven by the sustained higher margin environment across global LNG markets, coupled with higher lifting margins, due to higher Henry Hub prices. We recognized an income 574 TBtu of physical LNG during the second quarter including 570 TBtu from our projects and four TBtu sourced from third parties. Approximately 85% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SPA or IPM agreements. We are pleased to announce that we generated positive net income of $741 million in the second quarter. However, the net income line continues to be impacted by the unrealized non-cash derivative impact related to our long-term IPM agreements as we have discussed on prior earnings calls. In fact we recognized $1.3 billion of these unrealized non-cash derivative losses in the second quarter alone, as Gulf Coast netback curves continue to rise in Q2. As a reminder, because GAAP requires mark-to-market accounting of these long-term gas supply agreements but does not permit the mark-to-market of the associated sale of LNG, resulting in a mismatch of accounting methodology for the purchase of natural gas and the corresponding sale of LNG, which drives this quarterly variability in net income from period-to-period. As Jack noted, during the quarter we launched and closed on our widely syndicated financing for Corpus Christi Stage III, raising approximately $4 billion of new capital, which was the final step needed for us to reach FID. As part of the financing, we amended and restated the CCH credit facility with 36 financial institutions, increasing total commitments by $3.7 billion to approximately $4 billion, extending the maturity by multiple years and reset the borrowing rate to SOFR plus 150. Approximately $300 million of outstanding borrowings were rolled over from the previous facility. And since closing in June, a little over $400 million was incrementally drawn as of the end of the quarter. In addition to the credit facility, we amended and restated the working capital facility at CCH, increasing commitments by $300 million to $1.5 billion extending the maturity to 2027 and reset our borrowing rate to SOFR plus 125. The working capital facility remains undrawn. We are appreciative of a long-term partnership with our global bank group that has consistently supported us through the years including on Stage III, which further highlighted Cheniere's ability to continue to develop and structure world-class infrastructure projects with brownfield economics, underpinned by lump sum turnkey EPC arrangements with Bechtel and a diverse mix of long-term creditworthy take-or-pay commercial contracts. Thanks to our financial results so far this year and the expected proceeds from the early termination of our TUA with Chevron. We continue to make progress on our comprehensive long-term capital allocation plan on a significantly accelerated schedule. Not only has our prioritization on debt paydown accelerated the deleveraging of our consolidated balance sheet, but also we are more than halfway through our three-year $1 billion share repurchase authorization in less than a year. During the quarter, we prepaid $1.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness bringing our total debt repaid or redeemed to just over $3 billion under our capital allocation plan. So, we are more than three-quarters of the way through our four-year deleveraging goal in about a year and a half years. The expected proceeds from the Chevron prepayment will likely further accelerate the pace of our deleveraging by the end of the year. In the second quarter alone, we repurchased 4.1 million shares for approximately $540 million, including approximately 2.7 million shares from Icahn Enterprises for approximately $350 million, which brought its shareholdings in Cheniere below the threshold for Board representation established in the nomination and standstill agreement that has been in place since 2015. We have also continued to declare and pay our quarterly dividend of $0.33, which we plan to grow over time now that we have completed or announced the first four quarterly payments. And finally, in terms of allocating capital to accretive growth projects, we reached FID in Corpus Christi Stage 3 and issued Bechtel full notice to proceed in June. Given this accelerated progress and our approximately $7 billion of forecasted DCF in 2022, our plans for a revised capital allocation plan have also accelerated. And we anticipate coming to The Street with an updated plan for the future before the end of the year. While robust deleveraging and reaching investment grade in the next year or so will remain a priority, you can likely expect a recalibration of allocation between debt paydown, shareholder returns and future growth on a relative basis, particularly as we continue to develop and commercialize this future growth. Turn now to Slide 14 where I will provide some more detail on our third consecutive significant increase to 2022 guidance. We are increasing the midpoint of our guidance ranges for full year 2022 consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow, each by over $1 billion, bringing expected consolidated adjusted EBITDA to $9.8 billion to $10.3 billion. Distributable cash flow of $6.9 billion to $7.4 billion. With the recent distribution announcement for CQP, we are also tracking to the high end of the $4 to $4.25 guidance range. As Jack mentioned about half of the $1.6 billion increase in EBITDA is attributable to the expected proceeds from the early termination of the TUA with Chevron set to be paid to SB LNG prior to year-end. The other half is due to curves moving higher over the balance of the year. In addition, our forecast has improved due to smaller contributing factors, such as some of the open capacity for 2022 that was previously reserved for long-term origination, being released to CMI, higher lifting margin, lower shipping costs and some third party sourcing and portfolio optimization. With respect to the EBITDA sensitivity from here, we have sold much of our total expected production for this year and have approximately 40 TBtu unsold remaining. We currently forecast that a $1 change in market margin would impact EBITDA by approximately $20 million for the rest of 2022, as we continue to reserve some unsold volume for long-term originations in Q4. 2022 continues to prove the power of the Cheniere platform and what can be achieved when operational excellence and seamless execution are combined during an elevated commodity backdrop. Thanks to our team's relentless focus on safety and reliability at both of our facilities. We continue to outperform expectations with respect to operational performance and financial results, which brings an even stronger balance sheet, increased shareholder returns, and further accretive growth into focus. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions. Hey Jeremy, it's Zach. And thanks for the question. I mean, it was less than a year ago we came out with capital allocation. We thought we'd have $10 billion of available cash through 2024. Maybe it's double at this point just where the curves are? And how much earlier Train six came online? So yeah, we're going to owe everyone a capital allocation plan with much bigger numbers this year, because it's just been so much more accelerated. So as we think about it, there's this pile of money and how do we break it out. And we'll definitely recalibrate to an extent the debt pay down to shareholder returns. No need for the 4:1 ratio of debt paydown to buybacks going forward. So there's going to be quite a bit of money allocated to share buybacks overtime. And as you can see, we did over $0.5 billion just in Q2 and you saw some of the dislocation there and we were really opportunistic. So you can assume that that's going to happen. There'll be a regular cadence quarterly that we will always be buying back stock, but we'll be extra aggressive whenever we see things like what happened in June. Sure. This is Zach. And you know, full well we don't really give guidance on 2023, until the November call. So that's coming in a couple of months. But what I can say is that, we're comfortably over 90% contracted on our nine trains, plus Stage III at this point through the mid-2030s. And for the next decade, we're on average 95% contracted across everything. However, considering a few of the remaining contracts, aren't going to stand up or start until 2023 or even early 2024. There is actually a reasonable amount of open capacity next year, especially in the first half before most of these contracts, that still haven't started yet, related to the first nine trains begin. But that's not to say we're not still comfortably over 90% even next year. But if you look at the curves, and on average for the rest of this year, next year, high 20s if not better, we're comfortably confident that we can beat the $5.5 billion of run rate EBITDA on nine trains again next year. So it could be a really strong year, before 2024 or so, where we're almost fully contracted on the nine trains until Stage 3 ramps up in 2025, 2026 and then we have a little more open capacity again. I mean, the team is selling what it can for the rest of this year into the winter and in the first half of next year, physically. And that's even trying at times with all the volatility that we're seeing. But to put in perspective financially to hedge out over a year, that's not really realistic to be done right now. I mean, 18 months ago early last year, you might have to reserve, I don't know, $15 million, $20 million, $25 million to lock in a $3 margin on a cargo for the prompt month. That's now $300 million with the volatility doubling since then. And if you can go out six months, you're almost talking about $1 billion. So financially hedging out all that far is not really realistic or tenable. So we've been most successful on locking in on a Henry Hub plus basis, or just on a fixed price basis. And what we're doing is really, reducing any liquidity risk and taking on likely more credit risk, but that's why, even on the short-term book these days, it's just as essential working with IG counterparties that are reliable or those that can post enhanced credit support upfront. Right. I think just locking in the contract and doing that aluminous know [ph] procedure even in early March, huge advantage to us that probably set Stage 3 apart from most other projects that are trying to get done this year. And as Jack mentioned that $600 to $700 a tonne on an unlevered basis that's correct. That's including contingency the six times CapEx to run rate EBITDA of, let's say, one 1 billion to one two billion that's good too. And that's where we stand today. And if you think about our financing we raised 50% leverage on it. So it goes a little over $7 billion when you add the interest costs and the financing fees that's SOFR plus 150 so less than 4% funding. We're going to delay draw that over time with equity. So it's about $800 million a year for debt and equity on average through construction. Yes. I think you got it. That Train 6 for a full quarter. There was a little extra maintenance so it can go up and down quarter-to-quarter, but that's about right. And that's why you saw the O&M be up a bit this quarter."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Randy Bhatia. Please go ahead, sir.\nRandy Bhatia: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Cheniere\u2019s first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. The slide presentation and access to the webcast for today\u2019s call are available at cheniere.com. Joining me this morning are Jack Fusco, Cheniere\u2019s President and CEO; Anatol Feygin, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Zach Davis, Executive Vice President and CFO. Before we begin, I would like to remind all listeners that our remarks, including answers to your questions, may contain forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from what is described in these statements. Slide 2 of our presentation contains a discussion of those forward-looking statements and associated risks. In addition, we may include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the appendix to the slide presentation. As part of our discussion of Cheniere\u2019s results, today\u2019s call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP, or CQP. We do not intend to cover CQP\u2019s results separately from those of Cheniere Energy, Inc. The call agenda is shown on Slide 3. Jack will begin with operating and financial highlights, Anatol will then provide an update on the LNG market, and Zach will review our financial results and guidance. After prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. I will now turn the call over to Jack Fusco, Cheniere\u2019s President and CEO.\nJack Fusco: Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today, and thank you all for your continued support of Cheniere. I\u2019m pleased to be here this morning to review our first quarter 2022 achievements and discuss our further improved 2020 outlook. Before we begin, I would like to spend a moment discussing the tragic situation that continues to unfold in Ukraine since we last spoke in February. Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Ukraine and broader Europe as they navigate these volatile and uncertain times. At Cheniere, we built strong relationships with and support the communities in which we live and work and that includes those who we supply LNG. Since the beginning of the year, over 75% of cargoes produced by Cheniere have landed in Europe. That amounts to over 150 cargoes of LNG and we are just beginning. As Europe looks to reduced its dependency on Russian energy supplies and the administration looks to support our allies, the relevance and criticality of energy security in the role of LNG and natural gas as a reliable, flexible and cleaner burning fuel, has never been more evident to customers and governments the world over. We have been active participants in the U.S. EU task force on energy security. And we believe that increased cooperation around the world is essential to ensure our allies and partners along with our customers have access to energy in the months and years ahead. For these reasons, I have challenged our operations teams to do everything possible to safely and responsibly produce as much LNG as possible through our continued operational excellence programs, which we will address in more detail this morning. Now please turn to Slide 5, where I will review some key operational and financial highlights for the first quarter as well as introduce our upwardly revised these guidance ranges. For the first quarter, we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $3.2 billion and distributable cash flow of $2.5 billion, both of which benefited from the early completion an accelerated ramp-up of Sabine Pass Train 6, and were further supported by sustained higher market margins throughout the quarter. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2022, I\u2019m pleased to announce that we are once again significantly raising our full year 2022 EBITDA and distributable cash flow guidance. We now forecast 2022 consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $8.2 billion to $8.7 billion and distributable cash flow of $5.5 billion to $6 billion, both increases are driven by sustained higher margins on open volumes, did a higher than forecasted global LNG prices across the year, increased expected volumes from both maintenance optimization and accelerated ramp-up of Sabine Pass Train 6 as well as an increase in lifting margins driven by higher domestic natural gas prices. Zach will address guidance in more detail in a few minutes. Specifically on our operational excellence program, our efforts there to unlock low or no-cost incremental volume through maintenance optimization or debottlenecking efforts continue to be very successful. Over the last few weeks, our operations and maintenance planning teams have further optimized our planned maintenance activities for 2022 resulting in an increase in forecast production of approximately 30 TBtu or 8 cargoes of LNG, all of which is expected to be sold by CMI. We are pleased to be able to support our customers and leverage our LNG platform and our operations and maintenance expertise to unlock incremental volumes of LNG for a market that so clearly needs it. We appreciate the recognition by the administration and our regulators that U.S. LNG is essential now and in the years to come. And with the support from the DOE and FERC and the recent orders authorizing additional export volumes from our projects. We will continue to pursue further optimization and debottlenecking opportunities to increase our volumes to meet the rising worldwide demand for LNG. During the quarter, our teams continued to achieve milestones in terms of development, execution, operations and financial results. In partnership with Bechtel, not only did the Sabine Pass Train 6 reached substantial completion over a year ahead of guaranteed schedule, but following substantial completion, our team was able to bring Train 6 to full utilization and stable operations well ahead of plan, which along with general production outperformance across the portfolio also contributed to our financial results this quarter, with a few additional cargos supporting our increased guidance for the year. Shortly after substantial completion of Train 6 we announced the signing of our fully wrapped lump sum turnkey EPC contract with Bechtel for Corpus Christi Stage 3. We issued in fact a limited notice to proceed in order to commence early engineering, procurement, and site mobilization and preparation work, while we finalize the financing ahead of reaching FID, which we expect to occur this summer. I\u2019m extremely proud of the seamless operations continued excellence achieved by our Cheniere team. During the quarter, we safely produced, loaded and delivered a record number of volumes across our platform. Thanks to our continued focus on operational excellence and portfolio optimization. On the contracting front, we announced increases in extensions to existing long-term contracts with EOG and ONJ [ph] both of which reinforce the value of our commercial platform and the sustained long-term demand for LNG and natural gas and the global energy markets. And just this morning, we announced the new 15 year IPM agreement at Corpus Christi Stage 3, with ARC Resources, one of the largest natural gas producers in Canada. To signing this contract, once again, demonstrates our ability to provide innovative, flexible solutions for our global customer base. And this IPM agreement further enables Canadian gas to reach international markets. Each of these agreements support the sanctioning of Stage 3 and reflect the urgency in the global market for investments in new LNG capacity, as customers from around the world look to secure long-term supply, which Anatol will discuss in more detail shortly. Finally, in terms of our financial strategy, Zach and his team are executing on our long-term capital allocation plan faster than originally forecast due to the sustained higher margins, accelerating our initial debt pay down timeline, returning capital to shareholders and unitholders and currently in the process of raising the financing and have a formal sanctioning of Stage 3. Turning now to Slide 6 for an update on the significant progress we have achieved in our climate and sustainability initiatives. In April, we announced our latest QMRV program that builds upon our existing study with natural gas producers and LNG shipping providers. Now applying that methodology and rigor to examining the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the delivery of natural gas to our facilities. As part of the program, we announced a collaboration with several of our key midstream infrastructure providers, including Kinder Morgan, Williams, MPLX, DT Midstream, and Crestwood, as well as multiple emission detection technology providers and leading academic institutions to improve the overall understanding of greenhouse gas emissions, and further deployment of advanced monitoring technologies and protocols across midstream infrastructure that\u2019s part of our value chain. From here, we expect to commence a similar QMRV program specific to our liquefaction equipment. We expect these robust QMRV program to improve the data and transparency of emissions throughout the LNG value chain to help maximize the climate benefits and environmental competitiveness of U.S. natural gas in Cheniere LNG. These QMRV programs are built upon our climate and sustainability principles and support our broader climate strategy initiatives, especially our cargo emission tags, which will begin providing to our customers this year. Now please turn to Slide 7. While I provide a brief update on Corpus Christi Stage 3, as I mentioned a moment ago during the quarter we finalized EPC contract with Bechtel for Stage 3 and we released them to begin early work under a limited notice to proceed. And you can see early visual progress on Stage 3 site preparations in the slide. We are pleased to have the contract finalized and Stage 3 underway with pricing consistent with what we\u2019ve communicated to the investment community over the past few years. We expect to announce the FID of Corpus Christi Stage 3 soon after we finalize the financing of the project, which is currently in process. Once completed Corpus Christi State 3 is expected to provide the global market with over 10 million tons of incremental LNG per year. The development of additional LNG capacity has ever more critical as countries work to secure, reliable, and affordable energy supplies for the long-term in support of both energy security and environmental priorities. As such, we continue to develop opportunities to leverage infrastructure at both of our existing brownfield sites for further LNG capacity additions. Both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi possess significant in place infrastructure that puts capacity additions at those sites at a significant cost advantage relative to greenfield development. We look forward to sanctioning Stage 3 sometime in the summer and coming back to you after that with our plans for further LNG capacity growth, which would be supported by brownfield economics and underpinned by long-term contracts consistent with our investment parameters. With that, I want to reiterate my gratitude to the entire Cheniere team for their work to ensure the reliability of our LNG during these unprecedented times in our industry. I will now turn the call over to Anatol, who will provide an update on the LNG market.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks Jack and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9. As Jack noted, the global energy and natural gas landscape has faced significant challenges this year. We find ourselves in uncharted territory as impacts from the war in Ukraine filter through gas markets, sparking extreme price volatility, and a renewed focus on security of reliable long-term natural gas supply. In March JKM and TTF daily prices were pushed to new all-time highs with April deliveries reaching approximately $85 and $72 per MMBtu respectively. That being said, since our last call, JKM predominantly traded at a discount to TTF as Europe transitioned from being the market of last resort, once responsible for balancing the global LNG market to the market of greatest need with destination flexible LNG available to respond to the market signal. While geopolitical risk premiums have since subsided front month settlement prices remain elevated given the structural tightness that\u2019s been present in the market since the second half of 2021. As you can see from the middle chart on this slide, LNG supply growth continues to be underpinned by the U.S. with U.S. LNG exports growing 23% year-on-year to 20.4 million tons. This growth has been supported by the strong call on LNG demand in Europe, as well as new capacity additions, including Sabine Pass Train 6. Overall supply grew 6% or 4 million tons year-on-year in Q1 with supply growth from the U.S. and to a lesser extent, Russia offsetting declines resulting from outages in Indonesia and Malaysia maintenance in Qatar as well as gas supply disruptions in Nigeria. U.S. LNG represented nearly half of European LNG imports during the quarter helping meet the needs of our European allies and partners. In fact, Cheniere produced cargos supplied more LNG into Europe than any other country in Q1 with approximately 75% of volumes produced at our facilities landing in the region, a testament to the market responsiveness of destination flexible LNG, largely pioneered by Cheniere and the U.S. LNG industry. Please turn to Slide 10, where we will look at the regional dynamics in a little more detail. Much like last quarter, the focus in Q1 has been on the European market and how much LNG it can divert from Asia. However, the fear of supply interruptions from the war in Ukraine have only exacerbated the sense of urgency in what was already a tight market given the strong rebound in post-pandemic demand, low inventory levels in the region and limited spare LNG production capacity. Russian gas flow into Europe, trended downwards throughout 2021, but trended even lower in Q1 of 2022, while the ongoing conflict has raised fears of disputes and flow disruptions. As a result, Europe began relying more heavily on LNG imports rather than Russian pipeline gas for the first time. Pipeline imports from Russia felt 26% year-on-year or 11 BCM as buyers nominated down shipments via Ukraine and reverse flows eastward. Record high LNG imports were able to plug the gap representing nearly one-third of Europe\u2019s total gas supply in Q1 up from just 20% a year ago. Fortunately, the 66% year-on-year jump in LNG imports helped ease Europe\u2019s gas storage deficit, and brought inventories back within the five year range. As of April, inventories are finally approaching 2021 levels. More than two-thirds of Atlantic Basin LNG flowed to Europe in the first quarter as Europe bid cargos away from Asia. As a result, LNG imports into Asia dropped 8% or 5.8 million tons creating increased demand for alternative sources of gas and power supply. Four of the world\u2019s top five LNG buyers, all in Asia scaled back LNG imports during the quarter, reflecting the impact of higher global prices, deferred consumption, and fuel switching. In Japan and Korea, higher nuclear and coal fired power generation helped make up for lower LNG imports with the LNG falling 11%, 2.6 million tons and 4%, 0.5 million tons year-on-year in each market, respectively. At the end of Q1 major Japanese electric utilities, LNG inventories were approximately 0.8 million tons below 2021 levels. Taiwan was the only major Asian buyer to post growth, adding 0.4 million tons of LNG demand that\u2019s up 8% relative to Q1 2021. Thanks to restrictions on cold burn during winter and reduced nuclear capacity lending supports to gas generation. JKT LNG imports returned to growth in March on the back of coal fired power maintenance and outages in Korea and Taiwan, as well as an increased call on gas fired generation, following a relatively minor earthquake in Japan. In China, LNG imports fell 13% or 2.6 million tons year-on-year in the first quarter as buyers opted to instead divert high value cargos to the premium market in Europe. Domestic gas production and imports of Russian pipe gas increased in the first quarter, but were not enough to balance domestic price levels. Deregulated prices for domestic trucked LNG roughly doubled in February and March compared with the same period in 2021, indicating a tight gas market despite robust coal fired generation and of course, some recent COVID induced lockdowns. Thailand served as the largest growth market in Asia during the quarter importing a record 2.3 million tons of LNG that was up 16% quarter-on-quarter. Thailand procured spot LNG cargos to continue providing gas to the power in industrial sectors, amid declines in both domestic gas production and pipeline gas imports from Myanmar. Please turn to slide 11. While it is likely too early to draw conclusions around the long term impacts of the current geopolitical uncertainty, the war in Ukraine is already having a significant impact on energy policy thinking globally with long-term security of supply a top the priority list of utilities and governments alike. Europe is now fast tracking additional LNG infrastructure throughout the region, which coupled with the inclusion of natural gas within the EU green taxonomy last fall, we believe further reinforces the critical role of natural gas in the region\u2019s energy mix for the long-term. How quickly and how orderly Europe is able to fulfil its stated objectives to reduce its reliance on Russian gas will have a meaningful impact on global market conditions for natural gas over the next few years, despite the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, Russian gas has continued to flow. However, last week, Russia halted exports to Poland and Bulgaria over refusal to pay for gas supply in rubles marking an escalation between Russia and Europe, specifically with respect to energy supply. Regardless of how quickly and orderly Europe produces its dependence on Russia, supply demand signals suggest that tighter and potentially volatile near-term gas market. At least through the current LNG supply cycle, especially with the Asian demand growth story remaining firmly intact. As a result, we believe the market will see a shift in LNG procurement strategies as more buyers seek the stability, security and reliability of long-term LNG contracts. As Jack mentioned, the demand for our flexible and reliable LNG on a long-term basis has only been amplified this year given the outlook for continued market volatility and our ability to structure tailored solutions for our customers. Our recently announced deals with NG, [ph] EOG and ARC Resources, not only evidence the long-term view of the role of LNG and natural gas in the global energy mix, but also highlight the criticality of reliable and flexible long-term energy supply. The value proposition that clearly benefits Cheniere\u2019s customers. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Zach to review our financial results and guidance.\nZach Davis: Thanks, Anatol, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to be here today to review our first quarter 2022 financial results. Our key financial accomplishments and our increased 2022 guidance, a testament to the value of our platform and the effectiveness of the entire Cheniere team. Turning to Slide 13. During the first quarter, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.2 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $2.5 billion, both record quarterly amounts. Our first quarter results benefited from the drivers of our guidance increase back in February, namely the early completion and accelerated ramp to full utilization of Sabine Pass Train 6 combined with a sustained higher margin environment across global LNG markets. Additionally, the contribution of a few CMI cargos loaded at year end 2021, but delivered in 2022, as well as incremental lifting margin based on higher Henry Hub prices further contributed to first quarter results. We recognized an income 592 TBtu of physical LNG during the first quarter, including 581 TBtu from our project and 11 TBtu sourced from third parties. Approximately 82% of these LNG volumes recognized in income we\u2019re sold under long-term SPA or IPM agreements. We generated a net loss of $865 million in the first quarter. The net income line continues to be impacted by the unrealized non-cash derivative impact related to our long-term IPM agreements as we have discussed on prior earnings calls. Turning to our progress on capital allocation. We are executing on the plan we laid out in September of last year on a significantly accelerated pace, as higher than expected marketing margins and production are providing a meaningful tailwind to the timeline we previously laid out. During the first quarter, we redeemed or repaid over $800 million of long-term indebtedness bringing the total now to over $2 billion out of the $4 billion we targeted to pay down by the end of 2024. During the first quarter, we also repurchased nearly a quarter of a million shares for approximately $25 million and paid our second quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021. While we have prioritized that paydown thus far given our consolidated leverage targets, the share repurchase plan is in a good position to meaningfully repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis, including in the present quarter as our cash balances have continued to grow. Commercialization of Stage III was completed with the EOG transaction and further enhanced by the NG deal, as well as the ARC Resources IPM transaction we announced this morning. In addition, we have also officially signed over the Glencore, ENN and Tourmaline contracts to Sabine Pass now that train 6 is up and running, which leaves our long-term contracts with CPC, PGNiG, Sinochem, Foran, [indiscernible] Apache, EOG, and now ARC. Deals available to underpin this Stage III financing, a truly global contract portfolio with a mix of FOB, DES, and IPM deals. The fixed price turnkey EPC contract with Bechtel was executed during the first quarter and Stage III is underway with Bechtel working under an LNTP. We officially launched the financing process in April with our bank group and expect to finalize a widely syndicated financing ahead of a full FID, which we expect to announce this summer. Turn now to Slide 14, where I\u2019ll provide some more detail around our second consecutive significant increase in 2022 guidance. We are increasing the midpoint of our guidance ranges for full year 2022 consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow each by another $1.2 billion, bringing expected consolidated adjusted EBITDA to $8.2 billion to $8.7 billion and distributable cash flow to $5.5 billion to $6 billion. This increase can be attributed to a few factors, summarized simply as more volume and higher margin. First, the incremental volume we\u2019ve added to our forecast from the continued success in maintenance optimization is driving an increase in the production forecast of approximately 30 TBtu or roughly eight cargos. In addition, the faster than expected ramp-up of Train 6, along with general production outperformance across the portfolio contributed a few extra cargos to the 2022 forecast. All told, this incremental production accounts for over half of the increase in forecasted EBITDA and DCF for the year. Second, market margins secured on our previous opening capacity were up by approximately $8 per MMBtu compared to our late February call. This increase in margin contributes about another $400 million in the EBITDA and DCF forecast. The balance of the increase is predominantly attributable to higher lifting margin on higher Henry Hub pricing. With respect to the EBITDA sensitivity from here, we have sold over 95% of our total expected production for this year and of approximately 70 TBtu unsold. This is based on the revised production forecast inclusive of the incremental volume, mainly from the maintenance optimization. We currently forecasted a $1 change in market margin would impact EBITDA by approximately $40 million for the rest of 2022. Under our revised capital allocation plan announced last September, we\u2019ve already repaid or redeemed over $2 billion of long-term debt and repurchased over 0.25 million shares through Q1 with the expectation of growing our deployment to both capital allocation initiatives further this quarter and through the rest of the year. Including our recent dividend declarations for Q1, we have also declared nearly $1 per share in dividends and began paying a base plus variable distribution at CQP. All of which has strengthened our balance sheet, accelerated our path to investment grade credit metrics and delivered value to our shareholders. Accelerated progress on our plan continues to be recognized by the credit ratings agencies. Just last week S&P upgraded SPL to BBB flat from BBB minus, setting the completion of Train 6 and the consistency and resiliency of our cash flows as catalysts for the ratings action. With CEI and CQP rated BB plus with positive outlook at S&P, we view this upgrade of SPL as a meaningful step towards reaching investment grade ratings at the corporate levels. And given our accelerated progress on this front, we anticipate coming back to you all with updated capital allocation goals in early 2023 or potentially later this year. Until then we\u2019ll continue to execute on our comprehensive plan, prioritizing debt paydown opportunistically repurchasing shares, paying our dividend and investing in Stage III. While we do not have any debt maturing for the balance of 2022, we do have our existing term loan at CCH, which is fully prepayable. We\u2019ll focus our debt paydown on this facility in the near term with an eye to the SPL maturity next spring as we expect to approach sustainable consolidated investment grade credit metrics across the company in the coming quarters. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Yes, sir. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nJack Fusco: Good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Thanks for taking my question here. Just wanted to start off with the guidance in the raise here. I was just wondering if you could maybe help us parse through a bit here, was the guidance raise, if you think about which quarters contributed to it, is that just reflecting the benefits in the first quarter being higher? Or should we think about the next three quarters being a little bit higher, than your original forecast, just trying to understand some of the drivers there?\nZach Davis: Hey, Jeremy, it\u2019s Zach over here. And I\u2019ll just say in the February call, we were pretty much two thirds the way through the quarter. So we pretty much anticipated then with Train 6 already up and running, that we would have a around $3 billion of EBITDA for Q1. So basically what\u2019s that saying is that this $1.2 billion increase is actually going to be spread out more so over Q2 through Q4. And clearly with $8.2 billion to $8.7 billion of EBITDA, $22 to $24 of cash flow. And honestly we\u2019ll be under four times on debt to EBITDA this year at this rate. We\u2019ll be capitalizing on capital allocation for the rest of the year, but to give people a sense of the numbers around the drivers of the $1.2 billion increase. As I mentioned, the 50 TBtu that were open going into the last call with $8 increase selling those cargos through the volatility in the mid 20s, let\u2019s say in terms of net backs, that was 400 million, and then all this optimization on maintenance and the incremental cargos that added over 600 million. And then yes, higher Henry Hub better lifting margin was about the rest. So really it\u2019s coming now you\u2019ll see it in the future quarters this incremental plus billion.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful there. Thanks for that. And maybe just pivoting towards the long-term guidance. I keep hearing you guys optimize and squeezing out more production. I\u2019m just wondering your kind of existing long-term run rate EBITDA guidance. Is that still current or should we be thinking kind of an upward bias to that just given all the incremental capacity that you guys keep squeezing out here?\nJack Fusco: Yes, Jeremy. First, I\u2019ll take some of that. I am so proud of my maintenance and operations teams for what they\u2019ve been able to do with these trains. And their focus on maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of the trains to get them to optimal performance has just been fantastic and world class. But as far as the actual run rate guidance, I\u2019ll turn that over to Zach.\nZach Davis: Sure. So yes, though for the rest of this year, and honestly, even next year, we\u2019re seeing netback and let\u2019s say the mid to high teens in our forecast. We\u2019re going to stick with the existing forecast for you all where we had CMI at 200 to 250 [ph] because we can honestly make a very good living building new infrastructure, like Stage III with long-term contracts in that range. Just to put in perspective for Stage III, it\u2019s $7 billion unlevered, six times CapEx the EBITDA and pretty much fully contracted at this point. And we\u2019re talking about double digit unlevered returns. So, for now we\u2019re holding tight with our long-term guidance for nine trains and then with Stage III, but with this extra cash I mean at this point from 2021 to 2024, it\u2019s about $16 billion of available cash. The number\u2019s getting a little silly, so we\u2019ll get you back to this year, which is only, let\u2019s say 5 billion plus. We\u2019ll be bringing down the share count. We\u2019ll be reducing interest expense, and ideally, eventually yes, increasing that guidance, but we\u2019ll stick with what we got today.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Going with beat and raises is a good way to go about it. So I thank you for all the color there. Really helpful. Thanks.\nJack Fusco: Thanks, Jeremy.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Brian Reynolds with UBS.\nBrian Reynolds: Hi, good morning, everyone. And appreciate all the color on the potential capital allocation update later in this year. So maybe to pivot to CCL Stage III, it appears that you guys are targeting a late 2025 in service date. But just given that you\u2019ve given, backed all the thumbs up to start construction effectively. And just given that you guys have brought on a few of your previous trains on nearly a year early, was curious if these mid-scale modular trains have the potential to come online in late 2024 versus late 2025 to take advantage of some of the market dynamics. Just given that the global nat gas market is expected to stay tight through the mid 2020s. Thanks.\nJack Fusco: Yes. Thanks, Brian. And what I\u2019ll say is I\u2019m always impressed with what David Craft and his team at E&C have been able to do with Bechtel and bring our trains in significantly ahead of schedule. And my expectation is still that way. As you know, we tend to be fairly conservative in our guidance and we\u2019ve guided you guys to the guaranteed delivery dates from Bechtel. And as we get sooner into that FID, I will keep you informed to let you know of what our expectations are. But right now that plan is to have the first train producing LNG and a commercial ops by the end of 2025, and then every three to four months thereafter, have another train startup. And \u2013 but as you can tell, I think the world of my team and I\u2019m pretty confident we will hit the plan.\nBrian Reynolds: Great, appreciate that feedback. Maybe as a follow-up, curious if you could just provide some commentary on the QMRV program to monitor, GHG emissions. I was curious if you could share some of the early results of the program and whether the data that you were effectively collecting is helping. Counterparties and customers get comfortable with signing up the SPA contracts, specifically those counterparties that were a little bit more hesitant to sign up for long-term deals given the ESG concerns before. Thanks.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Ryan. This is Anatol. I\u2019ll start this. So it\u2019s still relatively early days. We\u2019re very optimistic. We\u2019re learning a lot, obviously kicks off the third leg of the stool at Gillis and we\u2019ll continue, as Jack said, to drive that and implemented our own facilities as well. One of the things that we\u2019re doing, as you know, is having it done in partnership with universities and academic institutions and making sure that all of the data are verified and properly collected and vetted. So it\u2019s too early to comment on any output, but the effort and the commitment and the obvious engagement that we have with the entire supply chain is critical, as you said, to moving forward and continuing to drive engagement with counterparties. And I think that that\u2019s the way the world is going to go and this will continue to keep us in a great position, leading the charge on all of these fronts and reducing our \u2013 ultimately reducing our lifecycle emissions. So too early to give you any specific findings, but we are learning a lot and we\u2019ll have a lot more to say over the coming quarters.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. Looking forward to it. That\u2019s all for me. Have a great day everyone.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Lapides: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter and guidance raised. I\u2019m going to come back to the maintenance optimization and I want to tie this into the debottlenecking that you\u2019ve talked about a little bit. Is what you\u2019re seeing is a pull forward of the debottlenecking a little bit, meaning the extra 1 million to 2 million tons a year that you\u2019ve talked about? Or is this simply a delaying some maintenance work from 2022 and maybe doing it in 2023? So kind of just pulling \u2013 pushing out that maintenance work so maybe volumes this year are a little bit more elevated, but you kind of lose a little bit of that when we think about next year.\nAnatol Feygin: Yes, Michael, this is Anatol. Doesn\u2019t have anything to do with debottlenecking. So our maintenance optimization program, it\u2019s a continuous process. My ops and maintenance teams are constantly working to ensure that that they can maximize production through, I\u2019ll call it, a reliability centered program. So we actually as we get into the year, we start doing more diagnostics on the actual equipment that we\u2019re going to maintain and looking at its performance. And what we found out this year is that we had scheduled in our five year plan to do the maintenance based off of a time-based schedule from the original equipment manufacturers. And now, we\u2019ve went to a reliability centered program and that\u2019s allowed us to extend the useful lives of that \u2013 those components. And in this case, it ended up having us produce, as Zach mentioned, over eight cargoes of additional production. And I just think it benefits everybody that we continually challenge ourselves and make sure that we\u2019re maximizing the performance of those components before we change them out. So that\u2019s what we mean by maintenance optimization.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. And there is a little bullet in this in the queue. I\u2019m just curious, do you see now that you\u2019ve got all 6 trains fully running at Sabine that there\u2019s some cost savings, cost synergy opportunities over the next year or so or even longer term, where kind of an average cost per train might come down on the O&M side.\nJack Fusco: Yes, absolutely. I mean you should think of us as a southwest of liquefaction trains, right? We have 9 trains that are the same design, and there should be significant synergies now on parts and labor and operational effectiveness.\nZach Davis: And I\u2019ll just add that if you look at our O&M results and you compare it to Q4 compared to Q1 last year, now that we\u2019re just producing a lot more that that dollar per MMBtu is coming down, and you should expect that for the full year.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thanks guys. Much appreciated.\nZach Davis: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now take our next question from Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse.\nSpiro Dounis: Thanks operator. Good morning guys. Jack, would appreciate your thoughts on the regulatory landscape and U.S. energy policy here more broadly. I think we\u2019ve seen a few branches and positive developments from this administration to support more U.S. LNG into Europe, but feels like that\u2019s kind of stop short of a comprehensive policy to really foster more development. So curious what you\u2019re seeing and hearing from regulators and policymakers both here and in Europe.\nJack Fusco: Well, needless to say that the EU has been very, very helpful and very grateful for what we\u2019ve been able to do and the 150 cargoes that that were produced at Cheniere and sent to Europe. Our relationship with the regulators, FERC, FEMSA, the administration has always been strong. We\u2019ve talked about it before that the Obama administration approved our ability to export and our permits to build the facility. And we continue to work collaboratively with all of them. I was very pleased that we got tank one back in service and that we\u2019re working closely with them on tank three. We\u2019ve got the additional capacity from FERC on our debottlenecking efforts and then we got the DOT non-FTA approval. So we\u2019re getting what we need. They\u2019re very busy these days. We\u2019re having to be patient, but we\u2019ll continue to work collaboratively with the bunch.\nSpiro Dounis: Great. That\u2019s helpful. Second question, just moving to upstream and working more with E&Ps, seeing a lot more upstream companies express interest in LNG and tapping into that market. Your announcement, of course, with ARC is another great example of that. We do have some E&Ps talking about taking on equity interest in LNG projects directly. And so curious that you described your interest levels from here to take on more E&P customers and if you\u2019d be open at some point even jointly developing something going forward.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Spiro. This is Anatol chiming in. We love these IPM deals for a number of reasons. Obviously, it\u2019s very much in line with our risk tolerance and the fees that we collect from them. But it\u2019s also the gas supply that comes with it, the operational flexibility that comes with it. And as Zach mentioned, in the portfolios of the projects having a mix of FOB, DES and IPM transactions is a very elegant kind of composition. As you know, we\u2019ve always been limited by the pool of potential counterparties. We\u2019ve expanded that pool fortunately to include now two Canadian producers and the idea that we would more of this that center of the fairway for us. So especially as credit quality improves for the E&Ps that pool continues to increase. So you should expect more of that from us and we think that that\u2019s part of our balanced diet, if you will.\nZach Davis: And then on the partnerships and equity with new contracts, just to reiterate what was said before, but with $16 billion of available cash, 10 plus million tons of contracts already raised pretty much for Stage III. Yes, we\u2019re not going to need many contracts contingent on project equity. And clearly, we\u2019re pretty focused on simplifying the structure as much as possible. So happy to do more IPM deals with creditworthy counterparties and we\u2019ll leave it at that.\nSpiro Dounis: Got it. Helpful color, guys. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now take our next question from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Hi, good morning. Is the run rate for volume that you\u2019ve been at year-to-date like if you\u2019re looking at gas prices and stuff, a good proxy for the year for study state or do you anticipate that there\u2019s more maintenance kind of, not in the winter time that might bring down the average a little?\nZach Davis: Hey, this is Zach, I\u2019ll just stay. I think we produced around 11 million tons across the portfolio in Q1. And at the rate we\u2019re going accounting first, Train 6 coming online in February will be in our run rate range for all the trains this year on an annualized basis. So it might be slightly up just with the colder weather in Q1, but it\u2019s a decent proxy.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Great, thank you. And I know we\u2019re all focused on getting CC Stage 3 to FID but could you talk about the steps that would be required to get a train beyond that to market and whether you\u2019d kind of be comfortable contracting volumes on this theoretical train while it\u2019s still in the FERC process?\nJack Fusco: Yes. So I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll ask Anatol if he wants to jump in on it. We\u2019ve got very strong relationships with our customers and we pretty much \u2013 an ability for us to continue to grow this business. So I feel very comfortable that Cheniere will grow for many, many years hereafter. I think the brownfield aspects can\u2019t be matched. You can see from our Stage 3 that the economics are extremely strong and I think there\u2019s more run rate left.\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Thanks Jean Ann. And in terms of contracting, obviously you\u2019ve seen the activity, it\u2019s been a very strong three and even six months. This is the time when the U.S. product and Cheniere\u2019s product in particular, given its reliability and performance that we\u2019ve talked about stands out. And we have a range of offerings and as the market continues to absorb those volumes and continues to afford us incremental opportunities, we do have the opportunity engage on future projects as well. So we have the ability to serve customers with volumes right now with volumes, of course, of Stage 3 and given the strength of the market, there are discussions on further opportunities as well.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Great. Thank you and congrats on the guidance.\nJack Fusco: Thanks.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now take our next question from Sean Morgan with Evercore.\nSean Morgan: Hey guys. So it\u2019s a bit of a continuation on that same theme, but so if we see this really rapidly changing market where a lot of Russian market supply to Europe might be kind of upper grabs and sort of a market share shift, is there \u2013 one part is kind of how long would it take to get FERC approvals on an expansion for beyond Stage 3 in terms of whole months. And if it\u2019s going to take sort of a long time, you have potentially this and not trying to minimize the 10 mtpa that is coming on with Stage 3, but if you have this maybe unique opportunity, would potentially buying a FERC approved project, that\u2019s kind of stalled out that you guys are not involved with on the table?\nJack Fusco: Look, you heard from Zach, Sean that we\u2019re building Stage 3 at six times, EBITDA, that creates a significant amount of long-term value. So I do think \u2013 there\u2019s the build and buy situation. I\u2019ve seen it my whole career and for the foreseeable future, I just think we can build it faster, better, cheaper than buying it from someone else.\nSean Morgan: Okay, great. And then the news on the import/export bank potential involvement, I mean, is that you guys have traditionally been able to finance everything that you wanted to develop on your own, how do you sort of view the involvement potentially by Federal government on building this, is that an opportunity to reduce the cost of capital? Is it advantageous for Cheniere, how do you kind of think about that?\nJack Fusco: Yes, I can only speak for Cheniere, but I\u2019ll just say we\u2019re quite confident just with our bank group, which is a mix of say 30 to 40 project finance and investment banks that in the next couple months, we\u2019ll get binding commitment for $3.5 billion to $4 billion spread, let\u2019s say 1.5% or so. And that\u2019s not going to need any government agency funding support whatsoever or XM support. So we have a bank process that\u2019s already kicked off and we\u2019re going to get what we need really efficiently and quite attractive as well from the regular bank market. So can\u2019t really speak to those that may need that.\nSean Morgan: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot, Zach and Jack.\nJack Fusco: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Marc Solecitto with Barclays.\nMarc Solecitto: Hi, good morning. Just one on my end, as the largest domestic buyer of natural gas, curious is there any insight you have on the recent strength in domestic gas prices and as more LNG export capacity is added, if you think $3 Henry Hub is still the equilibrium point, or does this call on U.S. LNG kind of change that at all, recognizes a multitude of variables that factor into that with domestic production and international pricing. Just curious about any thoughts you might have on that dynamic.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Marc. This is Anatol again. We still see the U.S. gas market \u2013 U.S. and Canadian gas market, I should say, as structurally a $3 to $4 market. We do think that there\u2019s a bit of a latency in responding to these price signals as the curve continues to move up, you\u2019ve see an increase in activity, you\u2019re seeing once again, record production of natural gas that lagged after we had that record production number into late 2019 that has lagged the recovery in LNG exports. But we think that that will catch up in the coming quarters and feel very good about this $3 to $4 level long-term. In the short term, much like there\u2019s not much of a switching capability globally because commodity prices are elevated across the board. The similar dynamic is playing out domestically, right. That we have very high coal prices domestically. So the fuel switching bans are at a point of inelasticity. So we think that there will be a supply response. We think that\u2019s well underway and the curve is sort of pricing that as we get into to the $4 range as we get into the back half of next year and beyond.\nMarc Solecitto: Great. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Ben Nolan with Stifel.\nBen Nolan: Yes, thanks. Hey guys. So obviously, Corpus expansion is next on the list and the same I\u2019m sure would be true of the FERC process, but I\u2019m just curious, there\u2019s been a lot of activity in the market around Louisiana and other projects and so forth. How are you thinking about \u2013 so being past, is there any possibility that you might consider sort of simultaneously developing or expanding both facilities or is it just really Corpus into the foreseeable future?\nJack Fusco: No. I\u2019d say, we have two great sites and two great assets. We have additional real estate at both sites, and it\u2019s not out of the question to see us pivot \u2013 either do them both or pivot to back to Sabine. The third birth is coming along very well. I know there haven\u2019t been any questions on it, but we would expect to receive our first shift there, sometime at the end of this year. And then we\u2019ll have more infrastructure there to load additional ships. So we\u2019re very excited about our prospects. But I \u2013 Ben, if you can, I got to keep my team focused on making sure we execute what\u2019s in front of us. And we get Stage 3 across the finish line. That\u2019s first and foremost for all of us here. And then we\u2019ll look at additional growth potential.\nBen Nolan: Okay. I absolutely understand that, Jack. And then if I could just real quick for Anatol. You\u2019d mentioned a little bit in your prepared remarks that a number of the Asian markets were sort of down a little bit is more the volume, more the LNG was moving to Europe and the prices better. Do you think that there are possibly any long-term implications there? Do you think as a function of what\u2019s happening at the moment that there might be some long-term demand destruction? Just because prices are as high as they are and Europe is buying as much as they are.\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Great and very valid quite. And we keep as close an eye on that as possible. We don\u2019t see anything. In part, it is again, going back to the previous discussion, it\u2019s a competing fuels issue. Like, Australian coal is $16, $17 an ounce, right? So that\u2019s no bargain either. And in fact it is much more expensive than the long-term contracted supply that we and others bring to the table. So we\u2019re not seeing any pivots away from the commitment to natural gas. We still see Asia as the driver of gas demand. Obviously, what\u2019s going on in Europe will change the supply portfolio. But it is not going to meaningfully change the overall gas demand profile and Asia we believe will. And to your part \u2013 partly to your question, the contracting activity that you\u2019ve seen over the last three, six months has still been very Asia driven, right? So we expect that to continue. We are keeping a very close eye on that. And at this point, I don\u2019t see any structural shifts in the demand profile going forward.\nBen Nolan: All right. I appreciate it. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll now take our next question from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: Thank you. Thanks for greeting me in here. I\u2019ll just combine my questions into one really. The question is just given the commodity price environment and the geopolitical tensions that you referenced. Can you just talk kind of broadly how you think that all might shape the duration and structure of contracts going forward? And the second part of that, just in light of everything, all your comments earlier about Europe, why are we seeing most of the new LNG contracts get announced come out of Asia? I\u2019ll stop there. Thanks.\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Thanks Mike. It\u2019s Anatol, again. So the fundamental driver to the second part of your question is going back to the previous question, that\u2019s where the demand growth is, right? So if you\u2019re going to underpin your load serving entities that have growing demand, it makes perfect sense to us. And we\u2019ve always seen and said that the majority of the long-term contracts are going to be driven by those structurally short Asian players. The European issues obviously a little too early to call right now, what\u2019s happening and what should be happening is a tremendous focus on infrastructure solutions like that has to come first. We\u2019ve seen these record numbers of imports into Europe and their constraint, right? There\u2019s only so much that you can bring into the existing infrastructure. So that is for Europe to solve first. They\u2019re dedicating a lot of resources. The governments are dedicating a lot of resources to solving these bottlenecks. So we\u2019ll see more our ability to bring volumes into Europe, but how that is commercially underpinned still has yet to shake out. So unprecedented times and challenges, Asia\u2019s going to continue to be the growth driver. And the majority of contracts signed this last quarter were 20 years or longer. So we\u2019ve always believed that 20 year \u2013 the demise of the 20 year contract that was greatly exaggerated. And you\u2019ve seen that in the last few quarters really come back again, as you said, driven by the Asian players.\nMichael Blum: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now take our last question from Matt Taylor with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.\nMatt Taylor: Yes. Thanks for taking this last one. Zach, like you said, your cash flow is starting to look a bit silly here. So with that backdrop, but Jack has your thinking changed at all on broadening your organic development lens? What I mean by that is extending the value chain a bit and developing shorter cycle opportunities. Well, obviously you focused would still be on long-term contracting. But I\u2019m wondering if you guys are thinking through on how to potentially develop beyond just production capacity.\nZach Davis: I\u2019ll go first as CFO, and then let Jack chime in if he wants. But I think we enjoy the sweet spot that we\u2019re in right on the Gulf Coast of Texas Louisiana with Corpus and Sabine. And I\u2019ve mentioned before, we like our debt metrics in the 4x to 5x, not our valuations. So we\u2019re going to stick with just liquefaction on the coast and not go too far upstream. And then downstream, I think we\u2019re the biggest fans of anyone creating more demand for our product. But we\u2019ll let others do that because that\u2019s a very different risk adjusted return prospect.\nJack Fusco: Very well, Zach.\nMatt Taylor: Yes. Thanks for that.\nOperator: All right, everyone. It does conclude our question \u2013 go ahead.\nJack Fusco: No. I just wanted to thank everybody for their continued support of Cheniere. It has been an interesting time to be in the energy markets, and we appreciate all of your support.\nOperator: And that does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Anatol Feygin",
            "content": "Thanks Jack and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9. As Jack noted, the global energy and natural gas landscape has faced significant challenges this year. We find ourselves in uncharted territory as impacts from the war in Ukraine filter through gas markets, sparking extreme price volatility, and a renewed focus on security of reliable long-term natural gas supply. In March JKM and TTF daily prices were pushed to new all-time highs with April deliveries reaching approximately $85 and $72 per MMBtu respectively. That being said, since our last call, JKM predominantly traded at a discount to TTF as Europe transitioned from being the market of last resort, once responsible for balancing the global LNG market to the market of greatest need with destination flexible LNG available to respond to the market signal. While geopolitical risk premiums have since subsided front month settlement prices remain elevated given the structural tightness that's been present in the market since the second half of 2021. As you can see from the middle chart on this slide, LNG supply growth continues to be underpinned by the U.S. with U.S. LNG exports growing 23% year-on-year to 20.4 million tons. This growth has been supported by the strong call on LNG demand in Europe, as well as new capacity additions, including Sabine Pass Train 6. Overall supply grew 6% or 4 million tons year-on-year in Q1 with supply growth from the U.S. and to a lesser extent, Russia offsetting declines resulting from outages in Indonesia and Malaysia maintenance in Qatar as well as gas supply disruptions in Nigeria. U.S. LNG represented nearly half of European LNG imports during the quarter helping meet the needs of our European allies and partners. In fact, Cheniere produced cargos supplied more LNG into Europe than any other country in Q1 with approximately 75% of volumes produced at our facilities landing in the region, a testament to the market responsiveness of destination flexible LNG, largely pioneered by Cheniere and the U.S. LNG industry. Please turn to Slide 10, where we will look at the regional dynamics in a little more detail. Much like last quarter, the focus in Q1 has been on the European market and how much LNG it can divert from Asia. However, the fear of supply interruptions from the war in Ukraine have only exacerbated the sense of urgency in what was already a tight market given the strong rebound in post-pandemic demand, low inventory levels in the region and limited spare LNG production capacity. Russian gas flow into Europe, trended downwards throughout 2021, but trended even lower in Q1 of 2022, while the ongoing conflict has raised fears of disputes and flow disruptions. As a result, Europe began relying more heavily on LNG imports rather than Russian pipeline gas for the first time. Pipeline imports from Russia felt 26% year-on-year or 11 BCM as buyers nominated down shipments via Ukraine and reverse flows eastward. Record high LNG imports were able to plug the gap representing nearly one-third of Europe's total gas supply in Q1 up from just 20% a year ago. Fortunately, the 66% year-on-year jump in LNG imports helped ease Europe's gas storage deficit, and brought inventories back within the five year range. As of April, inventories are finally approaching 2021 levels. More than two-thirds of Atlantic Basin LNG flowed to Europe in the first quarter as Europe bid cargos away from Asia. As a result, LNG imports into Asia dropped 8% or 5.8 million tons creating increased demand for alternative sources of gas and power supply. Four of the world's top five LNG buyers, all in Asia scaled back LNG imports during the quarter, reflecting the impact of higher global prices, deferred consumption, and fuel switching. In Japan and Korea, higher nuclear and coal fired power generation helped make up for lower LNG imports with the LNG falling 11%, 2.6 million tons and 4%, 0.5 million tons year-on-year in each market, respectively. At the end of Q1 major Japanese electric utilities, LNG inventories were approximately 0.8 million tons below 2021 levels. Taiwan was the only major Asian buyer to post growth, adding 0.4 million tons of LNG demand that's up 8% relative to Q1 2021. Thanks to restrictions on cold burn during winter and reduced nuclear capacity lending supports to gas generation. JKT LNG imports returned to growth in March on the back of coal fired power maintenance and outages in Korea and Taiwan, as well as an increased call on gas fired generation, following a relatively minor earthquake in Japan. In China, LNG imports fell 13% or 2.6 million tons year-on-year in the first quarter as buyers opted to instead divert high value cargos to the premium market in Europe. Domestic gas production and imports of Russian pipe gas increased in the first quarter, but were not enough to balance domestic price levels. Deregulated prices for domestic trucked LNG roughly doubled in February and March compared with the same period in 2021, indicating a tight gas market despite robust coal fired generation and of course, some recent COVID induced lockdowns. Thailand served as the largest growth market in Asia during the quarter importing a record 2.3 million tons of LNG that was up 16% quarter-on-quarter. Thailand procured spot LNG cargos to continue providing gas to the power in industrial sectors, amid declines in both domestic gas production and pipeline gas imports from Myanmar. Please turn to slide 11. While it is likely too early to draw conclusions around the long term impacts of the current geopolitical uncertainty, the war in Ukraine is already having a significant impact on energy policy thinking globally with long-term security of supply a top the priority list of utilities and governments alike. Europe is now fast tracking additional LNG infrastructure throughout the region, which coupled with the inclusion of natural gas within the EU green taxonomy last fall, we believe further reinforces the critical role of natural gas in the region's energy mix for the long-term. How quickly and how orderly Europe is able to fulfil its stated objectives to reduce its reliance on Russian gas will have a meaningful impact on global market conditions for natural gas over the next few years, despite the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, Russian gas has continued to flow. However, last week, Russia halted exports to Poland and Bulgaria over refusal to pay for gas supply in rubles marking an escalation between Russia and Europe, specifically with respect to energy supply. Regardless of how quickly and orderly Europe produces its dependence on Russia, supply demand signals suggest that tighter and potentially volatile near-term gas market. At least through the current LNG supply cycle, especially with the Asian demand growth story remaining firmly intact. As a result, we believe the market will see a shift in LNG procurement strategies as more buyers seek the stability, security and reliability of long-term LNG contracts. As Jack mentioned, the demand for our flexible and reliable LNG on a long-term basis has only been amplified this year given the outlook for continued market volatility and our ability to structure tailored solutions for our customers. Our recently announced deals with NG, [ph] EOG and ARC Resources, not only evidence the long-term view of the role of LNG and natural gas in the global energy mix, but also highlight the criticality of reliable and flexible long-term energy supply. The value proposition that clearly benefits Cheniere's customers. And now I'll turn the call over to Zach to review our financial results and guidance. Thanks, Ryan. This is Anatol. I'll start this. So it's still relatively early days. We're very optimistic. We're learning a lot, obviously kicks off the third leg of the stool at Gillis and we'll continue, as Jack said, to drive that and implemented our own facilities as well. One of the things that we're doing, as you know, is having it done in partnership with universities and academic institutions and making sure that all of the data are verified and properly collected and vetted. So it's too early to comment on any output, but the effort and the commitment and the obvious engagement that we have with the entire supply chain is critical, as you said, to moving forward and continuing to drive engagement with counterparties. And I think that that's the way the world is going to go and this will continue to keep us in a great position, leading the charge on all of these fronts and reducing our \u2013 ultimately reducing our lifecycle emissions. So too early to give you any specific findings, but we are learning a lot and we'll have a lot more to say over the coming quarters. Yes, Michael, this is Anatol. Doesn't have anything to do with debottlenecking. So our maintenance optimization program, it's a continuous process. My ops and maintenance teams are constantly working to ensure that that they can maximize production through, I'll call it, a reliability centered program. So we actually as we get into the year, we start doing more diagnostics on the actual equipment that we're going to maintain and looking at its performance. And what we found out this year is that we had scheduled in our five year plan to do the maintenance based off of a time-based schedule from the original equipment manufacturers. And now, we've went to a reliability centered program and that's allowed us to extend the useful lives of that \u2013 those components. And in this case, it ended up having us produce, as Zach mentioned, over eight cargoes of additional production. And I just think it benefits everybody that we continually challenge ourselves and make sure that we're maximizing the performance of those components before we change them out. So that's what we mean by maintenance optimization. Thanks, Spiro. This is Anatol chiming in. We love these IPM deals for a number of reasons. Obviously, it's very much in line with our risk tolerance and the fees that we collect from them. But it's also the gas supply that comes with it, the operational flexibility that comes with it. And as Zach mentioned, in the portfolios of the projects having a mix of FOB, DES and IPM transactions is a very elegant kind of composition. As you know, we've always been limited by the pool of potential counterparties. We've expanded that pool fortunately to include now two Canadian producers and the idea that we would more of this that center of the fairway for us. So especially as credit quality improves for the E&Ps that pool continues to increase. So you should expect more of that from us and we think that that's part of our balanced diet, if you will. Yes. Thanks Jean Ann. And in terms of contracting, obviously you've seen the activity, it's been a very strong three and even six months. This is the time when the U.S. product and Cheniere's product in particular, given its reliability and performance that we've talked about stands out. And we have a range of offerings and as the market continues to absorb those volumes and continues to afford us incremental opportunities, we do have the opportunity engage on future projects as well. So we have the ability to serve customers with volumes right now with volumes, of course, of Stage 3 and given the strength of the market, there are discussions on further opportunities as well. Thanks, Marc. This is Anatol again. We still see the U.S. gas market \u2013 U.S. and Canadian gas market, I should say, as structurally a $3 to $4 market. We do think that there's a bit of a latency in responding to these price signals as the curve continues to move up, you've see an increase in activity, you're seeing once again, record production of natural gas that lagged after we had that record production number into late 2019 that has lagged the recovery in LNG exports. But we think that that will catch up in the coming quarters and feel very good about this $3 to $4 level long-term. In the short term, much like there's not much of a switching capability globally because commodity prices are elevated across the board. The similar dynamic is playing out domestically, right.

            "name": "Jack Fusco",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today, and thank you all for your continued support of Cheniere. I'm pleased to be here this morning to review our first quarter 2022 achievements and discuss our further improved 2020 outlook. Before we begin, I would like to spend a moment discussing the tragic situation that continues to unfold in Ukraine since we last spoke in February. Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Ukraine and broader Europe as they navigate these volatile and uncertain times. At Cheniere, we built strong relationships with and support the communities in which we live and work and that includes those who we supply LNG. Since the beginning of the year, over 75% of cargoes produced by Cheniere have landed in Europe. That amounts to over 150 cargoes of LNG and we are just beginning. As Europe looks to reduced its dependency on Russian energy supplies and the administration looks to support our allies, the relevance and criticality of energy security in the role of LNG and natural gas as a reliable, flexible and cleaner burning fuel, has never been more evident to customers and governments the world over. We have been active participants in the U.S. EU task force on energy security. And we believe that increased cooperation around the world is essential to ensure our allies and partners along with our customers have access to energy in the months and years ahead. For these reasons, I have challenged our operations teams to do everything possible to safely and responsibly produce as much LNG as possible through our continued operational excellence programs, which we will address in more detail this morning. Now please turn to Slide 5, where I will review some key operational and financial highlights for the first quarter as well as introduce our upwardly revised these guidance ranges. For the first quarter, we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $3.2 billion and distributable cash flow of $2.5 billion, both of which benefited from the early completion an accelerated ramp-up of Sabine Pass Train 6, and were further supported by sustained higher market margins throughout the quarter. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2022, I'm pleased to announce that we are once again significantly raising our full year 2022 EBITDA and distributable cash flow guidance. We now forecast 2022 consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $8.2 billion to $8.7 billion and distributable cash flow of $5.5 billion to $6 billion, both increases are driven by sustained higher margins on open volumes, did a higher than forecasted global LNG prices across the year, increased expected volumes from both maintenance optimization and accelerated ramp-up of Sabine Pass Train 6 as well as an increase in lifting margins driven by higher domestic natural gas prices. Zach will address guidance in more detail in a few minutes. Specifically on our operational excellence program, our efforts there to unlock low or no-cost incremental volume through maintenance optimization or debottlenecking efforts continue to be very successful. Over the last few weeks, our operations and maintenance planning teams have further optimized our planned maintenance activities for 2022 resulting in an increase in forecast production of approximately 30 TBtu or 8 cargoes of LNG, all of which is expected to be sold by CMI. We are pleased to be able to support our customers and leverage our LNG platform and our operations and maintenance expertise to unlock incremental volumes of LNG for a market that so clearly needs it. We appreciate the recognition by the administration and our regulators that U.S. LNG is essential now and in the years to come. And with the support from the DOE and FERC and the recent orders authorizing additional export volumes from our projects. We will continue to pursue further optimization and debottlenecking opportunities to increase our volumes to meet the rising worldwide demand for LNG. During the quarter, our teams continued to achieve milestones in terms of development, execution, operations and financial results. In partnership with Bechtel, not only did the Sabine Pass Train 6 reached substantial completion over a year ahead of guaranteed schedule, but following substantial completion, our team was able to bring Train 6 to full utilization and stable operations well ahead of plan, which along with general production outperformance across the portfolio also contributed to our financial results this quarter, with a few additional cargos supporting our increased guidance for the year. Shortly after substantial completion of Train 6 we announced the signing of our fully wrapped lump sum turnkey EPC contract with Bechtel for Corpus Christi Stage 3. We issued in fact a limited notice to proceed in order to commence early engineering, procurement, and site mobilization and preparation work, while we finalize the financing ahead of reaching FID, which we expect to occur this summer. I'm extremely proud of the seamless operations continued excellence achieved by our Cheniere team. During the quarter, we safely produced, loaded and delivered a record number of volumes across our platform. Thanks to our continued focus on operational excellence and portfolio optimization. On the contracting front, we announced increases in extensions to existing long-term contracts with EOG and ONJ [ph] both of which reinforce the value of our commercial platform and the sustained long-term demand for LNG and natural gas and the global energy markets. And just this morning, we announced the new 15 year IPM agreement at Corpus Christi Stage 3, with ARC Resources, one of the largest natural gas producers in Canada. To signing this contract, once again, demonstrates our ability to provide innovative, flexible solutions for our global customer base. And this IPM agreement further enables Canadian gas to reach international markets. Each of these agreements support the sanctioning of Stage 3 and reflect the urgency in the global market for investments in new LNG capacity, as customers from around the world look to secure long-term supply, which Anatol will discuss in more detail shortly. Finally, in terms of our financial strategy, Zach and his team are executing on our long-term capital allocation plan faster than originally forecast due to the sustained higher margins, accelerating our initial debt pay down timeline, returning capital to shareholders and unitholders and currently in the process of raising the financing and have a formal sanctioning of Stage 3. Turning now to Slide 6 for an update on the significant progress we have achieved in our climate and sustainability initiatives. In April, we announced our latest QMRV program that builds upon our existing study with natural gas producers and LNG shipping providers. Now applying that methodology and rigor to examining the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the delivery of natural gas to our facilities. As part of the program, we announced a collaboration with several of our key midstream infrastructure providers, including Kinder Morgan, Williams, MPLX, DT Midstream, and Crestwood, as well as multiple emission detection technology providers and leading academic institutions to improve the overall understanding of greenhouse gas emissions, and further deployment of advanced monitoring technologies and protocols across midstream infrastructure that's part of our value chain. From here, we expect to commence a similar QMRV program specific to our liquefaction equipment. We expect these robust QMRV program to improve the data and transparency of emissions throughout the LNG value chain to help maximize the climate benefits and environmental competitiveness of U.S. natural gas in Cheniere LNG. These QMRV programs are built upon our climate and sustainability principles and support our broader climate strategy initiatives, especially our cargo emission tags, which will begin providing to our customers this year. Now please turn to Slide 7. While I provide a brief update on Corpus Christi Stage 3, as I mentioned a moment ago during the quarter we finalized EPC contract with Bechtel for Stage 3 and we released them to begin early work under a limited notice to proceed. And you can see early visual progress on Stage 3 site preparations in the slide. We are pleased to have the contract finalized and Stage 3 underway with pricing consistent with what we've communicated to the investment community over the past few years. We expect to announce the FID of Corpus Christi Stage 3 soon after we finalize the financing of the project, which is currently in process. Once completed Corpus Christi State 3 is expected to provide the global market with over 10 million tons of incremental LNG per year. The development of additional LNG capacity has ever more critical as countries work to secure, reliable, and affordable energy supplies for the long-term in support of both energy security and environmental priorities. As such, we continue to develop opportunities to leverage infrastructure at both of our existing brownfield sites for further LNG capacity additions. Both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi possess significant in place infrastructure that puts capacity additions at those sites at a significant cost advantage relative to greenfield development. We look forward to sanctioning Stage 3 sometime in the summer and coming back to you after that with our plans for further LNG capacity growth, which would be supported by brownfield economics and underpinned by long-term contracts consistent with our investment parameters. With that, I want to reiterate my gratitude to the entire Cheniere team for their work to ensure the reliability of our LNG during these unprecedented times in our industry. I will now turn the call over to Anatol, who will provide an update on the LNG market. Good morning, Jeremy. Yes, Jeremy. First, I'll take some of that. I am so proud of my maintenance and operations teams for what they've been able to do with these trains. And their focus on maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of the trains to get them to optimal performance has just been fantastic and world class. But as far as the actual run rate guidance, I'll turn that over to Zach. Thanks, Jeremy. Yes. Thanks, Brian. And what I'll say is I'm always impressed with what David Craft and his team at E&C have been able to do with Bechtel and bring our trains in significantly ahead of schedule. And my expectation is still that way. As you know, we tend to be fairly conservative in our guidance and we've guided you guys to the guaranteed delivery dates from Bechtel. And as we get sooner into that FID, I will keep you informed to let you know of what our expectations are. But right now that plan is to have the first train producing LNG and a commercial ops by the end of 2025, and then every three to four months thereafter, have another train startup. And \u2013 but as you can tell, I think the world of my team and I'm pretty confident we will hit the plan. Yes, absolutely. I mean you should think of us as a southwest of liquefaction trains, right? We have 9 trains that are the same design, and there should be significant synergies now on parts and labor and operational effectiveness. Well, needless to say that the EU has been very, very helpful and very grateful for what we've been able to do and the 150 cargoes that that were produced at Cheniere and sent to Europe. Our relationship with the regulators, FERC, FEMSA, the administration has always been strong. We've talked about it before that the Obama administration approved our ability to export and our permits to build the facility. And we continue to work collaboratively with all of them. I was very pleased that we got tank one back in service and that we're working closely with them on tank three. We've got the additional capacity from FERC on our debottlenecking efforts and then we got the DOT non-FTA approval. So we're getting what we need. They're very busy these days. We're having to be patient, but we'll continue to work collaboratively with the bunch. Yes. So I'll start and I'll ask Anatol if he wants to jump in on it. We've got very strong relationships with our customers and we pretty much \u2013 an ability for us to continue to grow this business. So I feel very comfortable that Cheniere will grow for many, many years hereafter. I think the brownfield aspects can't be matched. You can see from our Stage 3 that the economics are extremely strong and I think there's more run rate left. Thanks. Look, you heard from Zach, Sean that we're building Stage 3 at six times, EBITDA, that creates a significant amount of long-term value. So I do think \u2013 there's the build and buy situation. I've seen it my whole career and for the foreseeable future, I just think we can build it faster, better, cheaper than buying it from someone else. Yes, I can only speak for Cheniere, but I'll just say we're quite confident just with our bank group, which is a mix of say 30 to 40 project finance and investment banks that in the next couple months, we'll get binding commitment for $3.5 billion to $4 billion spread, let's say 1.5% or so. And that's not going to need any government agency funding support whatsoever or XM support. So we have a bank process that's already kicked off and we're going to get what we need really efficiently and quite attractive as well from the regular bank market. So can't really speak to those that may need that. Thank you. No. I'd say, we have two great sites and two great assets. We have additional real estate at both sites, and it's not out of the question to see us pivot \u2013 either do them both or pivot to back to Sabine. The third birth is coming along very well. I know there haven't been any questions on it, but we would expect to receive our first shift there, sometime at the end of this year. And then we'll have more infrastructure there to load additional ships. So we're very excited about our prospects. But I \u2013 Ben, if you can, I got to keep my team focused on making sure we execute what's in front of us. And we get Stage 3 across the finish line. That's first and foremost for all of us here. And then we'll look at additional growth potential. Very well, Zach. No. I just wanted to thank everybody for their continued support of Cheniere. It has been an interesting time to be in the energy markets, and we appreciate all of your support."

            "content": "Thanks, Anatol, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our first quarter 2022 financial results. Our key financial accomplishments and our increased 2022 guidance, a testament to the value of our platform and the effectiveness of the entire Cheniere team. Turning to Slide 13. During the first quarter, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.2 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $2.5 billion, both record quarterly amounts. Our first quarter results benefited from the drivers of our guidance increase back in February, namely the early completion and accelerated ramp to full utilization of Sabine Pass Train 6 combined with a sustained higher margin environment across global LNG markets. Additionally, the contribution of a few CMI cargos loaded at year end 2021, but delivered in 2022, as well as incremental lifting margin based on higher Henry Hub prices further contributed to first quarter results. We recognized an income 592 TBtu of physical LNG during the first quarter, including 581 TBtu from our project and 11 TBtu sourced from third parties. Approximately 82% of these LNG volumes recognized in income we're sold under long-term SPA or IPM agreements. We generated a net loss of $865 million in the first quarter. The net income line continues to be impacted by the unrealized non-cash derivative impact related to our long-term IPM agreements as we have discussed on prior earnings calls. Turning to our progress on capital allocation. We are executing on the plan we laid out in September of last year on a significantly accelerated pace, as higher than expected marketing margins and production are providing a meaningful tailwind to the timeline we previously laid out. During the first quarter, we redeemed or repaid over $800 million of long-term indebtedness bringing the total now to over $2 billion out of the $4 billion we targeted to pay down by the end of 2024. During the first quarter, we also repurchased nearly a quarter of a million shares for approximately $25 million and paid our second quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021. While we have prioritized that paydown thus far given our consolidated leverage targets, the share repurchase plan is in a good position to meaningfully repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis, including in the present quarter as our cash balances have continued to grow. Commercialization of Stage III was completed with the EOG transaction and further enhanced by the NG deal, as well as the ARC Resources IPM transaction we announced this morning. In addition, we have also officially signed over the Glencore, ENN and Tourmaline contracts to Sabine Pass now that train 6 is up and running, which leaves our long-term contracts with CPC, PGNiG, Sinochem, Foran, [indiscernible] Apache, EOG, and now ARC. Deals available to underpin this Stage III financing, a truly global contract portfolio with a mix of FOB, DES, and IPM deals. The fixed price turnkey EPC contract with Bechtel was executed during the first quarter and Stage III is underway with Bechtel working under an LNTP. We officially launched the financing process in April with our bank group and expect to finalize a widely syndicated financing ahead of a full FID, which we expect to announce this summer. Turn now to Slide 14, where I'll provide some more detail around our second consecutive significant increase in 2022 guidance. We are increasing the midpoint of our guidance ranges for full year 2022 consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow each by another $1.2 billion, bringing expected consolidated adjusted EBITDA to $8.2 billion to $8.7 billion and distributable cash flow to $5.5 billion to $6 billion. This increase can be attributed to a few factors, summarized simply as more volume and higher margin. First, the incremental volume we've added to our forecast from the continued success in maintenance optimization is driving an increase in the production forecast of approximately 30 TBtu or roughly eight cargos. In addition, the faster than expected ramp-up of Train 6, along with general production outperformance across the portfolio contributed a few extra cargos to the 2022 forecast. All told, this incremental production accounts for over half of the increase in forecasted EBITDA and DCF for the year. Second, market margins secured on our previous opening capacity were up by approximately $8 per MMBtu compared to our late February call. This increase in margin contributes about another $400 million in the EBITDA and DCF forecast. The balance of the increase is predominantly attributable to higher lifting margin on higher Henry Hub pricing. With respect to the EBITDA sensitivity from here, we have sold over 95% of our total expected production for this year and of approximately 70 TBtu unsold. This is based on the revised production forecast inclusive of the incremental volume, mainly from the maintenance optimization. We currently forecasted a $1 change in market margin would impact EBITDA by approximately $40 million for the rest of 2022. Under our revised capital allocation plan announced last September, we've already repaid or redeemed over $2 billion of long-term debt and repurchased over 0.25 million shares through Q1 with the expectation of growing our deployment to both capital allocation initiatives further this quarter and through the rest of the year. Including our recent dividend declarations for Q1, we have also declared nearly $1 per share in dividends and began paying a base plus variable distribution at CQP. All of which has strengthened our balance sheet, accelerated our path to investment grade credit metrics and delivered value to our shareholders. Accelerated progress on our plan continues to be recognized by the credit ratings agencies. Just last week S&P upgraded SPL to BBB flat from BBB minus, setting the completion of Train 6 and the consistency and resiliency of our cash flows as catalysts for the ratings action. With CEI and CQP rated BB plus with positive outlook at S&P, we view this upgrade of SPL as a meaningful step towards reaching investment grade ratings at the corporate levels. And given our accelerated progress on this front, we anticipate coming back to you all with updated capital allocation goals in early 2023 or potentially later this year. Until then we'll continue to execute on our comprehensive plan, prioritizing debt paydown opportunistically repurchasing shares, paying our dividend and investing in Stage III. While we do not have any debt maturing for the balance of 2022, we do have our existing term loan at CCH, which is fully prepayable. We'll focus our debt paydown on this facility in the near term with an eye to the SPL maturity next spring as we expect to approach sustainable consolidated investment grade credit metrics across the company in the coming quarters. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions. Hey, Jeremy, it's Zach over here. And I'll just say in the February call, we were pretty much two thirds the way through the quarter. So we pretty much anticipated then with Train 6 already up and running, that we would have a around $3 billion of EBITDA for Q1. So basically what's that saying is that this $1.2 billion increase is actually going to be spread out more so over Q2 through Q4. And clearly with $8.2 billion to $8.7 billion of EBITDA, $22 to $24 of cash flow. And honestly we'll be under four times on debt to EBITDA this year at this rate. We'll be capitalizing on capital allocation for the rest of the year, but to give people a sense of the numbers around the drivers of the $1.2 billion increase. As I mentioned, the 50 TBtu that were open going into the last call with $8 increase selling those cargos through the volatility in the mid 20s, let's say in terms of net backs, that was 400 million, and then all this optimization on maintenance and the incremental cargos that added over 600 million. And then yes, higher Henry Hub better lifting margin was about the rest. So really it's coming now you'll see it in the future quarters this incremental plus billion. Sure. So yes, though for the rest of this year, and honestly, even next year, we're seeing netback and let's say the mid to high teens in our forecast. We're going to stick with the existing forecast for you all where we had CMI at 200 to 250 [ph] because we can honestly make a very good living building new infrastructure, like Stage III with long-term contracts in that range. Just to put in perspective for Stage III, it's $7 billion unlevered, six times CapEx the EBITDA and pretty much fully contracted at this point. And we're talking about double digit unlevered returns. So, for now we're holding tight with our long-term guidance for nine trains and then with Stage III, but with this extra cash I mean at this point from 2021 to 2024, it's about $16 billion of available cash. The number's getting a little silly, so we'll get you back to this year, which is only, let's say 5 billion plus. We'll be bringing down the share count. We'll be reducing interest expense, and ideally, eventually yes, increasing that guidance, but we'll stick with what we got today. And I'll just add that if you look at our O&M results and you compare it to Q4 compared to Q1 last year, now that we're just producing a lot more that that dollar per MMBtu is coming down, and you should expect that for the full year. Thanks, Michael. And then on the partnerships and equity with new contracts, just to reiterate what was said before, but with $16 billion of available cash, 10 plus million tons of contracts already raised pretty much for Stage III. Yes, we're not going to need many contracts contingent on project equity. And clearly, we're pretty focused on simplifying the structure as much as possible. So happy to do more IPM deals with creditworthy counterparties and we'll leave it at that. Hey, this is Zach, I'll just stay. I think we produced around 11 million tons across the portfolio in Q1. And at the rate we're going accounting first, Train 6 coming online in February will be in our run rate range for all the trains this year on an annualized basis. So it might be slightly up just with the colder weather in Q1, but it's a decent proxy. I'll go first as CFO, and then let Jack chime in if he wants. But I think we enjoy the sweet spot that we're in right on the Gulf Coast of Texas Louisiana with Corpus and Sabine. And I've mentioned before, we like our debt metrics in the 4x to 5x, not our valuations. So we're going to stick with just liquefaction on the coast and not go too far upstream. And then downstream, I think we're the biggest fans of anyone creating more demand for our product. But we'll let others do that because that's a very different risk adjusted return prospect."

At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Randy Bhatia. Please go ahead.\nRandy Bhatia: Thanks, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Cheniere\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. The slide presentation and access to the webcast for today\u2019s call are available at cheniere.com. Joining me this morning are Jack Fusco, Cheniere\u2019s President and CEO; Anatol Feygin, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Zach Davis, Executive Vice President and CFO, and other members of Cheniere\u2019s senior management. Before we begin, I would like to remind all listeners that our remarks, including answers to your questions, may contain forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from what is described in these statements. Slide two of our presentation contains a discussion of those forward-looking statements and associated risks. In addition, we may include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the appendix to the slide presentation. As part of our discussion of Cheniere\u2019s results, today\u2019s call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP or CQP. We do not intend to cover CQP\u2019s results separately from those of Cheniere Energy, Inc. The call agenda is shown on slide three. Jack will begin with operating and financial highlights, Anatole will then provide an update on the LNG market, and Zach will review our financial results and 2024 guidance. After prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jack Fusco, Cheniere\u2019s President and CEO.\nJack Fusco: Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today as we review a successful 2023 and discuss our outlook for what is setting up to be a very busy and promising 2024. In 2023, we drove exceptional results across the key strategic priorities of the company and we did so while reinforcing our track record on safety, execution and operational reliability. I\u2019m extremely proud of my 1,600 Cheniere colleagues across operations, engineering and construction, origination and others who continue to be driven by excellence and take pride in solidifying Cheniere as best in class across our platform. We made significant strides despite some persistent macro headwinds and increased uncertainty in 2023, each largely driven by conflict, geopolitics and the evolving regulatory landscape, particularly right here in America. I\u2019ll touch on the latter in a moment, but the macro backdrop for LNG today provides a blunt yet clear reminder of the criticality of secure and stable energy supply and the value of a reliable and customer-focused operator who consistently delivers on its promises to its global stakeholders. Please turn to slide five, where I\u2019ll renew some key operational and financial achievements from the fourth quarter and full year 2023 and introduce our 2024 financial guidance. We generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.65 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year total to approximately $8.8 billion, the high end of our most recent guidance range. We generated approximately $1.1 billion of distributable cash flow in the fourth quarter and $6.5 billion for the full year, which is above the high end of our guidance range. Looking back at the original guidance provided for 2023, we beat the midpoint of each of those guidance ranges by over $500 million, once again illustrating the volatile nature of current global natural gas markets and the value of Cheniere\u2019s platform to monetize that volatility last year. For the fourth quarter, we generated approximately $1.4 billion in net income, bringing the full year total to approximately $9.9 billion. Strategically, 2023 was another year marked by significant accomplishments across the entire platform, and I\u2019ll highlight just a few of them here. First and foremost, we continue to execute on the company\u2019s long-term objectives with safety at the foundation of our actions, and in 2023, we once again demonstrated this by achieving a total recordable incident rate of 0.10, which is well within the top decile for industrial producers. We achieved this while simultaneously operating the second largest LNG platform in the world and being deep in construction on a 10-plus million ton per annum expansion project. These safety results are a source of tremendous pride for me and that pride should be felt by all the company stakeholders. We produced and recorded a record 169 LNG cargoes in the fourth quarter, bringing the total to a record 637 cargoes for the full year. Total production was in line with our forecast of about 45 million tons, inclusive of the successful major maintenance turnaround that\u2019s being passed over the summer. Europe remained the premium market for U.S. cargoes across 2023, as 73% of the volume produced at our facilities was delivered to Europe. Five new long-term customer contracts commenced over the course of 2023, representing approximately 3.7 million tons per annum. And earlier this month, we commenced our 1.1 million ton per annum PETRONAS contract, which was tied to Train 6 on the very first day of the DFCD window, holding to our standard of always meeting our customer commitment. On the E&C front, Corpus Christi Stage 3 is progressing on an accelerated timeline and we continue to forecast first LNG production from Train 1 at the end of this year. In 2023, we advanced total project completion to over 50%. I\u2019m extremely pleased with the progress we continue to make together with Bechtel on Stage 3, and I\u2019m optimistic for further schedule improvements over time. We took some important steps last year in preparation for Stage 3 to commence commissioning and operations. Construction on the ADCC Pipeline being built from Agua Dulce to support Stage 3 is progressing well and the pipeline is expected to be in service in the third quarter in advance of Train 1\u2019s accelerated startup. In addition, in the second half of last year, we purchased for approximately $100 million an existing 400-megawatt power plant in Corpus Christi, which is located on our property, in order to help mitigate risks associated with our increased power purchasing needs once Stage 3 commences operations. These milestones, coupled with the construction progress on the project, reinforces my confidence in Stage 3\u2019s timeline, improving over time with first LNG this year and meaningful LNG production added to our portfolio in 2025. Our commercial momentum continued in 2023 as LNG buyers the world over helped get the commercialization of the SPL expansion project off to an incredibly promising start. We have signed long-term agreements with six counterparties across Asia, Europe and Canada for an aggregate of over 6.5 million tons per annum, effectively commercializing all of Train 7. We are encouraged by the market\u2019s early reception, especially since the majority of these counterparties are repeat customers. I view it as a recognition of the value of Cheniere\u2019s reputation. We are focused on furthering development of the project in 2024 across commercialization, regulatory and financing work streams, with a focus on submitting our full permit application with the FERC before the end of this quarter. Throughout 2023, Zach and his team continue to execute on the 2020 Vision Capital Allocation Plan, making significant progress across the key pillars of the plan, debt reduction, capital return and disciplined growth investments. We\u2019ve paid down over a $1 billion of debt and achieved investment-grade ratings throughout our structure. We bought back almost 10 million shares for approximately $1.5 billion and declared dividends of $1.66 per share and we invested approximately $1.5 billion into Stage 3. We\u2019ve made great strides on the comprehensive plan since announcing it in late 2022. And now, turning our focus and attention to 2024, I am pleased to introduce our 2024 financial guidance of $5.5 billion to $6.0 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA, $2.9 billion to $3.4 billion in distributable cash flow and $3.15 per unit to $3.35 per unit distribution of CQP. We, again, are forecasting annual results that are above the midpoint of our run rate 9-train guidance and our expected results this year have a tremendous amount of visibility, given on how highly contracted we are. On the CQP distribution guidance, consistent with the prior messaging, we intend to maintain the $3.10 base distribution and adjust the variable component beginning in 2024 in order to begin preserving some cash and fortifying the CQP balance sheet as the SPL expansion project gains momentum. Zach will provide more details on the 2024 guidance in a few minutes. Turn now to slide six, where I will address the DOE news and our response. As you\u2019re all aware, the Department of Energy recently announced it would suspend making determinations on authorizations for LNG exports to non-free trade agreement countries, pending an update to the economic and environmental analysis underpinning its public interest determination methodology. While this decision does not currently impact our expansion projects or our FERC processes at Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi, it does introduce regulatory and permitting uncertainty into the U.S. LNG industry as a whole. I firmly believe that a fair and transparent regulatory framework is essential for the future development of natural gas infrastructure in the United States, particularly liquefaction capacity, given the scale of investment, commercial support and time required to bring these projects online. With that said, we believe we will secure all necessary regulatory approvals for mid-scale Trains 8 and 9, and the SPL expansion project within our expected timelines, as we have for more than a decade under multiple administrations. To be clear, the DOE action has not slowed down our expansion projects at either site. We are full steam ahead on Corpus Christi Trains 8 and 9 and the SPL expansion project development. We expect to file the FERC application for SPL very soon, and Corpus Christi Trains 8 and 9 are in advanced stages in the FERC approval process. The environmental assessment for Trains 8 and 9 is scheduled for receipt by the end of March, and we just received a letter of determination from PHMSA, a key agency in the FERC process last week. We remain confident that our previous timelines won\u2019t be materially impacted and we will maximize the efficiency with having Bechtel on site already through Stage 3. Having spent the last eight years at Cheniere, I\u2019ve never been more confident in the critical role of U.S. LNG in the global energy market, and I firmly believe the DOE studies will come to the same conclusion given, one, the importance of long-term energy security, two, the opportunities for global decarbonization through coal-to-gas switching for power generation and the critical role that dispatchable gas-fired power plants plays in backstopping intermittent renewables, three, low and stable domestic natural gas prices, and of course, four, the incredible economic benefits created in the communities where we live and work. Global energy markets are calling for additional LNG supply. The U.S. is significantly advantaged to answer this call with our abundant and low-cost natural resources, flexibility and affordability of U.S. volumes, and until recently, the reliability and certainty of the U.S. regulatory regime. Gulf Coast LNG positions the U.S. as a leader in facilitating energy security and worldwide emissions reductions. This is a generational opportunity, something we should be proud of and working to maximize, not restrict. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Anatol to discuss the LNG market. Thank you all again for your continued support of Cheniere.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. The global LNG market continued to rebalance throughout 2023 as Europe navigated its energy crisis and Asia adapted to the delicate new market equilibrium amid some regional economic headwinds. Global LNG trade grew by approximately 3% from 2022, adding 10.5 million tons of supply to the overall market. Aside from 2020, global supply growth has not been this low since 2011 through 2015 period. Nevertheless, this increase in supply was broadly matched by an increase in Asian demand, which grew approximately 4% year-over-year to approximately 263 million tons per annum as the region furthers its post-pandemic return. On the supply side, only one new train came online in 2023 globally, the third train at Tangguh LNG in Indonesia. Most of the growth in LNG output last year actually came from the continued ramp-up of existing projects in the U.S. The U.S. exported 86 million tons last year, becoming the world\u2019s largest exporter in 2023, ahead of Australia and Qatar for the first time, and more than half of those volumes were produced by Cheniere. In the fourth quarter alone, U.S. exports reached record highs of nearly 24 million tons, contributing to the global market\u2019s rebalancing. Despite persistent geopolitical unrest globally and the continued phase-out of Russian pipe gas in Europe, spot price levels have decreased this winter compared to last year due to a combination of mild weather, macroeconomic fundamentals, high storage levels and sufficient LNG supply availability. In the fourth quarter, TTF averaged $13.66 an ounce and JKM $14.97, both significantly lower than levels seen in the previous two years and both have continued to trend down through the first quarter of this year. Henry Hub benchmark also decreased in the fourth quarter, falling to an average of $2.88 an ounce. For the full year 2023, TTF monthly settlement prices averaged $13.73 an MMBtu, over 66% lower year-over-year and 4.6% lower than 2021. Similarly, the 2023 average settlement price for JKM decreased 53% year-over-year to an average of $16.13, while the Henry Hub average settlement price was $2.74, down approximately 59% from $6.64 in 2022 during the height of the energy crisis in Europe. Let\u2019s address the regional dynamics on the next page. With more than 65% of all U.S. LNG volumes in 2023 flowing in Europe, the region\u2019s underground storage inventories remained elevated throughout the year, easing concerns about physical market tightness amid further reductions in all other sources of gas supply to the region. Total gas supply to Europe fell 56 BCM year-on-year due mostly to the continued reduction in Russian flows, as well as heavy upstream maintenance in Norway further affecting pipe gas supply. Nonetheless, storage levels ended the calendar year at 86% full, the second highest level for the period since storage data became available in 2011. Meanwhile, gas demand in the region\u2019s key markets continued to drop, declining by nine% year-on-year in 2023, following a 12% reduction in 2022. The power sector accounted for nearly half of these reductions amid relatively mild temperatures, continued conservation efforts, improving nuclear performance and growth in renewable generation. And aside from Germany, industrial demand reductions appear to have bottomed out in 2023 throughout the region. In Asia, as I mentioned, LNG demand grew by four% or 9 million tons year-on-year, thanks to a resurgence in demand from China and other emerging economies throughout Asia. Most of the uptick in Asia\u2019s demand was largely due to a rebound in China\u2019s economy, which resulted in a 7.5% year-on-year increase in gas consumption. It was up 27 BCM. Despite a 13 BCM increase in domestic gas output and the scheduled 7 BCM ramp up in the Power of Siberia flows last year, China\u2019s reliance on LNG remained high at 25% of total gas supply. The country\u2019s imports rebounded by about 12% to 71 million tons last year, about 8.5 million tons below the peak 2021 levels. We continue to expect gradual but continued growth in gas consumption that will increase the call on LNG going forward. In addition to China, an approximately 8.5-million-ton year-on-year increase in South and Southeast Asia\u2019s imports also contributed to growing global demand last year. Thailand and India led the charge as LNG spot prices moderated and demand for gas-fired power generation reached record levels in India. Additionally, three new receiving terminals started in this region, giving the nascent import markets of the Philippines and Vietnam access to LNG, which we believe will help power their economies for years to come. LNG demand growth in Asia was partially offset by the reduced demand for LNG in Japan due to lower electricity demand and increased nuclear availability. In Japan, two nuclear reactors restarted in 2023, increasing available nuclear capacity to the highest level since the Fukushima disaster in 2011. This is a structural trend in Japan that we expect will continue to impact gas-fired power generation and consequently LNG imports over time. Let\u2019s move to the next slide where we\u2019ll consider the outlook for gas in these and other economies. As discussed, global gas demand in 2023 remained relatively flat, growing by 20 BCM or 0.05% amid tight global supplies and historically elevated prices. In contrast, global demand for coal was up 1.4% on the back of increased use in emerging and developing economies. Given the DOE action related to climate that Jack already discussed, it\u2019s worth highlighting here the simple fact that for the second year in a row, global coal consumption hit a new all-time record. Coal-fired power generation increased in 2023 despite continued coal-to-gas switching in the U.S., notable declines in Europe and significant growth in renewable generation overall, which rose over 22% globally. As shown in the lower left, more than half of the power demand growth in China and India in 2023 was supplied by coal. Coal-fired generation from these two nations alone increased by 419 terawatt hours, which is roughly equivalent to the total power generation for the entire country of France and more than 80% of the entire growth in renewable power generation seen last year. While China and India remain committed to growing gas as a primary energy source in their respective economies, tight gas supplies and higher-than-normal global LNG prices in recent years have impacted the pace of potential gas consumption growth in these developing economies. More broadly, coal remains the largest source of power generation globally and represents about two-thirds of power sector emissions and about a quarter of total emissions globally. With power demand expected to double by 2050, any hope of achieving global decarbonization and clean energy targets will require further displacement of coal use wherever possible, especially in countries like China and India. As Jack noted, natural gas holds a critical role in helping achieve these goals over the coming decades, which we expect will result in robust increases in demand for natural gas over that period, as shown by the outlooks on the central chart. The fast-growing economies in the Asia-Pacific region are expected to play the greatest role in powering gas demand beyond the 2040s, when demand from Europe and the developed world could possibly be in modest decline and regional gas supplies in Asia further deplete. The outlook for global gas demand should remain robust going into the second half of the century, because natural gas is an affordable, reliable and sustainable solution that will serve to displace coal and support the deployment of intermittent renewable energy sources. As such, in 2023 alone, we have executed over 6.5 million tons per annum of long-term agreements, representing over 119 million tons in aggregate volume of LNG between 2026 and 2050, the majority of which are with repeat customers and are structured to meet each customer\u2019s unique long-term objectives. These investment-grade counterparties include North American producers, portfolio players and Asian and European end-users, all of which seek secure, cleaner and affordable and flexible supply. Our customers sign up for decades of LNG from Cheniere because they believe in the long-term role of natural gas and they believe in Cheniere\u2019s ability to deliver the LNG reliably and responsibly. Looking ahead to 2024, as the market continues to stabilize and achieve the stable pricing necessary to ensure market access and adoption, we anticipate our premium products will continue to have broad-based appeal. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Zach to review our financial results and guidance.\nZach Davis: Thanks, Anatol, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to be here today to review our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and key financial accomplishments and introduce our financial guidance for 2024. Turn to slide 12. For the fourth quarter and full year 2023, we generated net income of approximately $1.4 billion and $9.9 billion, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.65 billion and $8.8 billion, and distributable cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively. With today\u2019s results, our full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA results were at the high end of our most recent guidance range and we exceeded the high end of the range on distributable cash flow, mainly attributed to higher margins captured on open capacity and optimization upstream and downstream of the plant. In addition, we have now reported positive net income on a quarterly and cumulative trailing four-quarter basis five quarters in a row. As compared to 2022, our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results continue to reflect a higher proportion of our LNG being sold under long-term contracts with less volumes being sold into short-term markets, as well as the further moderation of international gas prices relative to what we experienced in 2022. These impacts were partially offset by certain portfolio optimization activities that our teams were able to achieve throughout the year. During the fourth quarter and full year, we recognized in income 618 TBtu and 2,353 TBtu of physical LNG, respectively, which included 607 TBtu and 2,318 TBtu from our projects, a record for the full year, and 11 TBtu and 35 TBtu sourced from third parties, respectively. Approximately 90% and 87% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SBA or IPM agreements, with initial terms greater than 10 years, respectively. While we have many significant achievements to highlight from 2023, I\u2019m particularly proud of my team\u2019s focused execution on our 2020 Vision Capital Allocation Plan. We deployed approximately $5 billion towards balance sheet management, shareholder returns and accretive growth in 2023 alone, while maintaining strong available liquidity going into this year. In aggregate, since updating our Capital Allocation Plan in September 2022 with the target of $20 billion of cash deployment through 2026 and $20 per share of run rate DCF, we have now deployed over $8 billion. Execution under the plan got off to a fast start in early 2023 when we achieved investment-grade ratings at both of our parent entities, bringing the entire Cheniere complex to investment-grade status. And in June, we issued our inaugural corporate investment-grade bond, placing $1.4 billion of unsecured notes at CQP. These milestones follow approximately $8 billion of deleveraging over the last three years, from approximately $32 billion of debt at our peak to now under $24 billion. During the fourth quarter, we repaid $50 million of long-term indebtedness, further redeeming a portion of the senior secured notes due in 2024 at SPL, and bringing our total long-term debt paydown for the year to approximately $1.2 billion. We plan to address the remaining balance of the SPL 2024 notes with cash on hand within CQP early this year, after which point we will have addressed all maturities in the complex for the year. We have already begun strategizing around the 2025 maturities we have at both SPL and CCH, and as always, we will evaluate opportunities to efficiently refinance or delever throughout the year. The buyback plan is working as designed and enabling us to be opportunistic. During the fourth quarter and full year 2023, we repurchased an aggregate of approximately 2 million and 9.5 million shares of common stock for approximately $339 million and $1.5 billion, respectively. As the share price has provided greater opportunities so far this year compared to the fourth quarter 2023, deployment under the share repurchase plan has accelerated. In year-to-date or in just a month and a half or so, we have already deployed nearly $500 million, which is more than we did in any quarter in 2023, repurchasing almost 3 million shares so far, bringing our total shares outstanding to under $235 million currently. We will continue deploying the now under $2 billion remaining under the plan over the next year or so. With the expectation, we will get to the cumulative one-to-one share repurchase to debt paydown ratio and complete the current $4 billion authorization ahead of its three-year window, at which point the focus will primarily be on updating the buyback plan again with the Board while maintaining our IG balance sheet across the complex as we prepare for our creative growth initiatives at Corpus and Sabine in the coming years. We also declared $1.66 per common share in dividends for 2023, a nearly 15% increase year-over-year, having increased our quarterly dividend by 10% in Q3, consistent with our stated target of 10% annual dividend growth. Over time, we intend to steadily increase our overall payout ratio as our platform grows, while still maintaining the financial flexibility essential to our capital allocation plan and growth objectives. During the quarter, we funded approximately $467 million of CapEx at our Stage 3 project, bringing total spend to approximately $1.5 billion for the year and a little over $3 billion in total for the project. While front-loading the equity spend has enabled considerable interest savings, we still have over $3 billion available on our CCH term loan that we plan to utilize over time as the project progresses towards full completion in 2026 and we expect to spend between $1.5 and $2 billion in Stage 3 CapEx this year. Turn now to slide 13, where I will discuss our 2024 guidance and outlook for the year. Today, we are introducing our full year 2024 guidance ranges of $5.5 billion to $6 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $2.9 billion to $3.4 billion in distributable cash flow. As we\u2019ve been clear about on recent calls, 2024 represents our most contracted year-to-date, as all contracts signed to underpin our existing 45-million-ton platform have commenced, as well as some bridging volumes tied to contracts signed in support of our growth projects. It\u2019s likely 2024 will represent a trough year for EBITDA after being down sequentially since 2022, as we expect to move upward post-2024 as Stage 3 commences and eventually reaches run rate in 2026 and beyond. With very little unsold capacity remaining throughout the year, these ranges largely reflect our 9-train run rate guidance adjusted for a higher proportion of volumes sold under long-term contracts or bridging volumes, as well as some forward selling of spot cargoes at higher international gas prices. These positive adjustments are partially offset by the prepayment and cancellation of the Chevron TUA and some incremental O&M costs related to our planned maintenance program. We expect to produce approximately 45 million tons of LNG this year, inclusive of planned maintenance at both sites. We remain optimistic we will achieve first LNG from train one of Stage 3 this year, but that would not impact our revenues or EBITDA in 2024, as it will likely remain in commissioning through year-end. In terms of portfolio optimization activities, we include any such transactions already completed in the guidance, but we do not forecast additional [Technical Difficulty] 2022. We remains on track as we continue to execute on the plan this year and credit those to our commercial team who have sold our 2% open capacity going into this year, which has come down from 50 TBtu to 15 TBtu since the November call, highlighting that despite the recent drop in global gas indices, our EBITDA forecast remains above the $5.5 billion midpoint of our 9-train run rate guidance. As always, our results could be impacted by the timing of certain cargoes around year-end, as well as incremental margin from further optimization upstream and downstream of our facilities. Our distributable cash flow for 2024 could also be affected by any changes in the tax code under the IRA. However, the guidance provided today is based on the current IRA tax law guidance and assumes we qualify for the minimum corporate tax of 15% this year. As the year progresses, we will likely tighten our ranges consistent with what we\u2019ve done in the last two guidance cycles. At CQP, our full year 2024 distribution guidance range is $3.15 per common unit to $3.35 per common unit, which maintains our base distribution of $3.10 and a variable distribution of between $0.05 and $0.25. As we have discussed publicly for the last year, by adjusting the variable component of our base plus variable distribution this year, we are preserving cash and balance sheet capacity at CQP in anticipation of funding the $10-plus billion SPL expansion project according to our disciplined capital investment parameters, which call for financing the project 50% with cash flow, while maintaining investment-grade ratings at both SPL and CQP, all within a traditional MLP structure. This DPU guidance keeps us on our previously assumed FID timeline and should be viewed as an indication of our confidence in the attractiveness and viability of the SPL expansion project. In the near-term, deleveraging at CQP or SPL can be considered early investments in the SPL expansion project until we are in a position to formally sanction the project, raise financing and begin construction, which we plan for in 2026. We expect the accretive SPL expansion project could increase the run rate distributable cash flow at CQP to over $5 per unit, a win not only for CQP unit holders but LNG shareholders as well, since we are in the high splits of the MLP, meaning approximately 75% of the incremental cash flow would accrue to CEI, and further meaningfully increase our run rate DCF per share target over time, as it was not baked into the original 2020 Vision. Looking beyond this year, the Cheniere story remains the same. Our highly contracted business model is built upon long-duration, fixed-fee, investment-grade, take-or-pay-style cash flows, which underpin the $40 billion natural gas infrastructure platform we operate today. As we pursue brownfield expansions, our approach will be consistent with that of the first over 55 million tons, adhering to our disciplined investment parameters so that our cash flows and our value proposition remain insulated from whatever transitory supply and demand imbalances may occur over the next decade plus. Our company provides investors with exposure to LNG the theme, more so than the commodity, and it is inherent stability and long-term visibility in our contracted cash flows, growth and shareholder returns that should enable us to continue to deliver meaningful value to our stakeholders for decades to come. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first to John Mackay with Goldman Sachs.\nJohn Mackay: Hey. Good morning. Thank you for the time. I appreciate the color you guys gave on the 2024 guide and that you\u2019re already above the kind of 9-train run rate, but maybe you could just spend another minute talking through what kind of gets you to the low-end of the range versus the high-end of the range. It\u2019s about the same $500 million range as you gave for 2023, but there were more open volumes unsold at that point. So maybe just kind of walk through those dynamics? Thank you.\nZach Davis: Hi, John. It\u2019s Zach. And I\u2019ll just say the $500 million range is basically we\u2019re keeping the same cadence that we\u2019ve had for the last couple of years with the $500 million. It\u2019s still under 10% of the EBITDA. But it\u2019s safe to assume that we\u2019re going to start right now around the midpoint of that range and from there, I would say there\u2019s a few variables, even though the open capacity is so small and $1 CMI move in margins is only $15 million. With most of the year still ahead of us, $1 move in Henry Hub can move EBITDA in the lifting margin by around $100 million and just year-end timing of deliveries, that can move things around $100 million as well, even though a lot of those end-of-year cargoes are even locked in at pretty attractive rates by the team. When it comes to the upside and downside to the high-end and low-end, on the low-end, it would really have to be something unforeseen today operationally that got us that close to the low-end considering how locked in we are. So it would be maybe a longer maintenance cycle than we even had last year, which we don\u2019t foresee or a tougher hurricane season or something of that sort. On the upstream -- on the upside, I\u2019d just say, we\u2019ve been very clear from the get-go. We don\u2019t guide on optimization upstream and downstream of the plants that\u2019s not locked in. So as that accrues, ideally through the year, even though margins are lower, Henry Hub is lower and volatility has moderated, that should help us get to the upside and the, yeah, we\u2019ll stay optimistic on seeing if we can get a couple more cargoes out through the course of the year.\nJohn Mackay: I appreciate all that detail. Maybe just a follow-up and maybe this one\u2019s for Anatol. There\u2019s been obviously a lot of focus in the market on the next three years, three-and-a-half years for the LNG market with U.S. and Qatar supply coming online and the demand picture maybe not warming up as fast as we would have hoped. Understand the kind of long-term dynamics you talked about earlier in the call, but maybe just spend a couple minutes walking through what you see as this kind of medium-term outlook and maybe what the supply-demand balance looks like around the back half of this decade? Thanks.\nAnatol Feygin: Sure. Thanks, John. Thanks for the questions. I\u2019ll start kind of in reverse order. The market will grow what the supply allows it to grow, right? So the 10.5 million tons was a function of that supply coming into the market and being placed where it was most needed at the margin. The things that are encouraging to us and we see as kind of inexorable trends are the commitments to gas and the investments in long-dated infrastructure. Not a month goes by that we don\u2019t add a couple of regas terminals and things like gas-fired power plants are very difficult to get, turbines are difficult to get for years and that is a function of the deployment of that infrastructure globally. So we prefer a world where LNG is in those high-single, low-double-digit rates where returns for us are attractive but reasonable and the consumers can get their hands on these attractive BTUs. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, are competitive with coal and other generation sources. So we remain very optimistic. You\u2019ll see volumes going into South and Southeast Asia. You\u2019ll see the marginal kind of elastic demand come back into the market. We\u2019re already seeing that even in the early days post the Chinese New Year and we think that these are trends that will last for decades and decades to come and we have kind of those commercial -- the commercial engagements with those types of counterparties that are continuing apace. So we think the market will enjoy absorbing this volume and whether it comes online on schedule or if things are modestly delayed as they have been historically, we think that the market will show robust growth and ability to absorb this next wave.\nJohn Mackay: That\u2019s great. I appreciate the time today. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning.\nJack Fusco: Good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: I just wanted to kind of unpack a little bit more on your earlier comments there. When you talked about beating the midpoint at the prior guidance range, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a $0.5 billion or so. Just wondering, what type of quantum of optimization Cheniere has been able to realize because of volatility in the market, both upstream and downstream operations? What\u2019s that number look like?\nZach Davis: It\u2019s been in the hundreds of millions of dollars, Jeremy, in terms of the optimization. And I\u2019d say hundreds of millions of dollars, both in the upstream and downstream side. Mind you, Henry Hub was significantly up in 2022, moderated a bit last year and it\u2019s even further down today. So we\u2019ll see how much can be there. And then on the other side, yeah, we have a ton of IPM deals, DES deals. So we\u2019ll optimize those as we see fit and subcharter out any of our length in our shipping portfolio, which in the past has added hundreds of millions of dollars. Mind you, even that market has moderated as well in terms of the volatility. But when you add those two things together, it would really take, yeah, great execution and some opportunistic moments throughout the year for us to get to the high end of the range.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. So just to be clear there, then, hundreds of millions of dollars of synergies or optimization, rather, upstream and downstream, both we\u2019ve seen historically. And that\u2019s not really baked into the guidance as we see it today, because the guidance really just locks in what you\u2019ve already locked down. Is that the right way to think about things?\nZach Davis: Yeah. That\u2019s right. We were pretty clear for quite some time now, as we thought about this year, it\u2019d be the closest we would be to the run rate and considering how proactive we were going into this year, and now that we\u2019re only down to 15 TBtu, we\u2019re still above the midpoint of the run rate range for 9 trains and we don\u2019t even have the TUA from Chevron anymore. So this is -- where we expected it to be, it was baked into the 2020 Vision and the $20-plus-billion of cash flow through 2026 and we\u2019ll see how things play out on the optimization side, but it\u2019s not baked into this guidance today.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Very helpful. So a lot of upside potential, but not baked into the guide. Very clear there. Thank you very much.\nJack Fusco: Thanks, Jeremy.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Brian Reynolds with UBS.\nBrian Reynolds: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe to talk about just the distribution cut on the variable side, if you could just help talk about sizing and timing of that, and ultimately, how it relates to translating into the 15 MTPA expansion, assuming like an 850 build. So it seems like there\u2019s still a little bit of variable component in the guidance above that 3.1 kind of run rate. So just kind of curious how you came to that number and how we should think about pre-funding, just given it could be $10 billion to $15 billion for the SPL expansion? Thanks.\nZach Davis: Sure. So as we thought about the variable adjustment, I would say, over the last two years, we were incredibly efficient with our cash inside the CQP. And with the distributions, including the variable being over $4 both years, we probably distributed out almost $700 million more than even the run rate DCF per unit guidance that we give. So now it\u2019s time, as we\u2019re getting closer to officially filing with the FERC for the Sabine expansion and are targeting that 2026 FID, that we\u2019re going to start retaining some of the cash and bringing down the variable. We\u2019re saving around, let\u2019s say, $700 million. And a large portion of that will actually just go into paying down a bit of debt that\u2019s coming due, giving us this flexibility financially to add leverage capacity once we FID the project, stay with that, let\u2019s say, 50-50 debt-to-equity during construction and maintain the base distribution throughout while still being investment grade at Sabine and CQP. So we\u2019re trying to thread a needle there, and to do that, we need to start planning now. Mind you, some of the cash that\u2019s retained is also going into development of supporting the feed and getting Sabine expansion ready for FID and there\u2019s even $100 million or so baked in there for debottlenecking purposes. We think we\u2019ve found some ways to get to the higher end of the 4.9 to 5.1 range on the first exchange that hopefully can pay dividends to us in the coming years. So there\u2019s a few things in there, but it is mainly debt pay down in the near-term to add leverage capacity and flexibility in the long-term. Mind you, it\u2019s still $2 billion of distributions coming out of CQP this year with $1.2 billion of that going to CEI. But if we can pull all this off and build this project and get to that over $5 DPU, we\u2019re talking about almost $2 billion of consolidated EBITDA and we\u2019re talking about almost a $1 billion of DCF to CEI. So it\u2019s a win-win for all parties.\nBrian Reynolds: Right. Makes sense. Appreciate all that. My second question just around maybe further optimization. I know for the SPL expansion, it seems like there\u2019s some capital efficiency and optimization opportunities with boil-off gas and some other things. But as we think about existing asset base, I think, you talked about 45 MTPA being a good run rate. It seems like 2023 was above that. As we look ahead to 2024, have we squeezed out all the optimization on the existing asset base or are there some new technologies or engines that could help further drive efficiencies and optimization on the existing asset base going forward? Thanks.\nJack Fusco: Brian, this is Jack. While we\u2019re not going to guide upwards of the 45 million tons today, I\u2019m always amazed at what my operations folks can deliver. So whether it\u2019s optimizing the trains or our maintenance schedule, we -- they have just constantly outperformed. So we\u2019re looking now, as Zach mentioned, at $100 or so million for debottlenecking. One of the things I find really promising is, we\u2019re looking at a new technology of our fin fans. Those are the fans that we use to cool the refrigerant that liquefy the natural gas and we think there\u2019s a big opportunity there. So we\u2019ll be trying that out in earnest this year and I hope to have more news for you on later calls.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. Appreciate it. Have a great rest of your morning.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Theresa Chen with Barclays.\nTheresa Chen: Good morning. Going back to Jack\u2019s comments on the evolving regulatory backdrop, with respect to the DOE pause, I\u2019m just curious how this impacted conversations with customers, both within the context of commercializing your expansion projects, but also in relation to the broader commitment that the U.S. Government has to LNG exports and the perception of your global customers and the credibility and competitiveness of the U.S. LNG industry. Any salient commercial color you can provide would be great?\nJack Fusco: Theresa, I think, I\u2019m going to just start with some overall comments, and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Anatol. But I have to say this isn\u2019t really new. We\u2019ve been through multiple administrations here at Cheniere. We\u2019ve been through multiple studies on the public interest in exporting America\u2019s natural gas. What is shocking and new is over the last eight years, I think, Cheniere has proven all the benefits to America and to our allies over exporting U.S. LNG. And I find it appalling that we need scientists to tell us theoretically, using theories and hypotheses, of the benefits or not. But as you know, we know that there are -- those benefits are factual, they\u2019re proven, they were witnessed by the world. So I really look forward to seeing this studies report. I look forward to the comment period so we can get the record straight and accurate. I\u2019m hopeful that cooler heads ultimately prevail and that the facts will be evident and this pause will be a distant memory. But with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Anatol. He can tell you a little bit about what our conversations have been with our customers.\nAnatol Feygin: Yeah. Thanks, Jack. And thanks, Theresa. Just to pick up where Jack left off, this is the third time the DOE is doing this study. And I would say, to Jack\u2019s point, the first two are a distant memory as the U.S. goes from kind of mid-90s of millions tons per annum of capacity today to close to 200 million tons per annum. We still think -- really believe that the U.S. will be the market\u2019s first 200-million-ton exporter and we will navigate this with the DOE. A lot of the things that we have been doing for the last four years or five years on our LCA and on our environmental science and tracking the emissions profiles, providing the cargo emission tags, are all things that are new in the equation. And then, of course, just the quantum of LNG exports from the U.S. and gas dedicated to LNG exports is a new component in this equation. So we -- to Jack\u2019s point, we look forward to DOE\u2019s methodical kind of science-based review and updating its profile. But we are confident and we relay the same answer to our customers in our commercial engagements, that we are confident that Cheniere will be able to navigate whatever comes out of the DOE and continue to prosecute expansions on our timeline. So this is not new. Every time there is a pivot, whether that is a modest pivot or a more major pivot, we have these discussions, but we\u2019ve navigated them for a decade plus and are confident we\u2019ll continue to do so and that\u2019s exactly the message that we give to our customers and we obviously firmly believe that.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you. And Anatol, going back to your comments related to the elasticity benefits in the market currently, as price-sensitive buyers increase interest. Can you elaborate on that and what do you think the magnitude of that demand can be if prices remain low?\nAnatol Feygin: Yeah. Look, the market -- it\u2019s hard to say that these are kind of unprecedented dynamics in the sense that the amount of infrastructure that has been brought online over the last three years to five years is unprecedented over that period. So we talk about the amount of liquefaction capacity that\u2019s coming online in the back half of this decade, but again, not a month goes by that there\u2019s not a new regas terminal Europe added five, Southeast Asia has added four, Europe will now add Alexandroupolis in Greece in the coming days or weeks. So the ability to consume this volume is enormous and we\u2019re approaching a scale now relative to the current 400 million tons of exports, which obviously will grow of almost 1300 million tons per annum of import capacity. So markets like India, which have rebounded strongly as prices moderate, are now in a position to import more than twice as much volume as it imported in 2023. That was not a position that India was in in early 2020, when prices were low and it was a price elastic consumer. So I think you\u2019ll see that price elastic demand function really surprised to the upside as Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, India, et cetera, are all in a position to take meaningful incremental volumes. So quite optimistic on that front and I think we all see these liquefaction numbers coming. And again, historically, they have surprised to the downside in terms of schedule and utilization. So we\u2019ll see how the world rebalances, but it certainly has the capacity to consume essentially whatever number you think will be added to the supply side.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Spiro Dounis with Citi.\nSpiro Dounis: Thanks, Operator. Good morning, team. I want to go back to the 2020 Vision, if we could, Zach. It\u2019s for about one and a half years into that program, and you mentioned tracking on or even had a plan to-date. But I guess if we just shift the focus to the forward outlook and think about that outlook for 2025, oh, sorry, 2024 through 2026, how does that compare to what you envisioned back in 2022? You sort of set that $20 billion target. I imagine some puts and takes since then, Stage 3 maybe coming on early, not sure where you had the LNG curve then, just trying to understand how much conservatism you imputed there.\nZach Davis: Sure. So I would just say we\u2019re still at $20-plus-billion of available cash through 2026, and there are some puts and takes. We\u2019ve made some more money in years like the past year. This year was always planned to be highly contracted. And then we assumed guaranteed completion dates for Stage 3, meaning not even -- Train 7 wasn\u2019t even going to come online until 2027, outside of that period of time. So all in, we\u2019re still over $20 billion. We\u2019ve deployed over $8 billion. So about 40% in about 30% of the time. But the main thing to focus on is really that excess cash and how we\u2019re going to deploy that going forward. And as you can tell, with some of the debt pay down, which will be less than we even did this year, staying inside of CQP, CEI is going to mainly be focused on catching up on the buyback and completing the equity funding of Stage 3. At this point, we\u2019ve done over $2 billion of buybacks, but we\u2019ve done over $3.5 billion of debt pay down. So there\u2019s still a $1.5 billion, give or take, that still needs to occur for that catch up of the one-to-one. So we\u2019ll be pretty focused on that this year. Case in point, the program was set up to be opportunistic at times like this and that\u2019s why the shares outstanding is trickling down. And by the end of the year or early next year, yeah, we\u2019ll probably have to upsize the plan again and keep on marching on this long-term path to eventually 200 million shares in the long-term run rate.\nSpiro Dounis: Got it. That\u2019s helpful, Zach. Thank you. Second question, just given your, I think, one of the largest buyers of natural gas, just curious how you\u2019re thinking about the supply over the next few years. I think right now, producers understandably retrenching, just given where pricing is. At the same time, we\u2019re hearing from some midstream companies that there are pockets of shortages in the Mid-Atlantic just due to the rise in data centers and other types of electric needs. So curious as you think about that outlook when all this energy capacity comes online in the next few years, do you think the producers are going to be able to stand up and sort of deliver on all that supply?\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Spiro. This is Anatol. I\u2019ll jump in. Look, we\u2019re very comfortable with and confident in the resource and the economics of developing that resource in this nation. The challenge we have, which we\u2019ve highlighted multiple times for years, is building infrastructure. And I think it\u2019s going to be a long time before anybody attempts another Mountain Valley Pipeline or equivalent out of what is an incredible resource in the Northeast, in the Marcellus and Utica. That said, you know us and we take very seriously and as a sacrosanct gas supply and the infrastructure needed to supply our facilities for decades to come and that\u2019s one of many reasons why the U.S. Gulf Coast is our home and we\u2019re very confident that Louisiana, Texas, Mid-Continent can continue to develop the resource and the infrastructure necessary to get it to us. Jack mentioned the ADCC pipeline that\u2019s moving well, obviously. Permian continues to grow and we\u2019ll need more intrastate infrastructure. We will need more interstate infrastructure as you probably saw we filed for together with our SPL application. So we\u2019re confident that the Gulf Coast will continue to be well supplied, but obviously, would prefer that other resource in the country was able to get to market as well.\nSpiro Dounis: Got it. Helpful color as always. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Tristan Richardson with Scotiabank.\nTristan Richardson: Hey, guys. Just one for me this morning. Follow up on a prior question about distribution levels of CQP. I mean, I think, that the philosophy of a base plus variable is relatively new going back to 2022. But is there a potential here that you could rethink that philosophy with the focus on retaining more cash in anticipation of the proposed SPL ex?\nZach Davis: I think what we planned in 2022 was planned for distributing out a lot of cash efficiently in 2022 and 2023, and then being in a position where we can do a mega project inside an MLP. So when we set the $3.10 distribution as the base, we intend to uphold that. Obviously, this year, we\u2019re actually even above that. We had enough cash to be able to meet our objectives going into developing and preparing for the Sabine expansion. And so we\u2019re going to distribute that out to CEI and our unit holders. But when it comes down to FID-ing the project in the next couple of years, the goal is to maintain the base distribution, stay investment-grade everywhere and fund the project within cash flow. So this all kind of works, which is pretty amazing for an MLP, but one with six trains fully up and running, it works quite well. And then as you think about the $3.10 base distribution or the $3.25 this year, yeah, again, we\u2019re still talking about $2 billion of distribution and an over 6% yield. So we were cognizant of making sure that that was competitive and kept us going in the right direction with our unit holders and our own stake in CQP.\nTristan Richardson: I appreciate it, Zach. And then maybe just to follow up on the 2024 guide, I think in the prepared comments, you highlighted a higher proportion of bridging volumes as one of sort of the upward items in the guide versus the 9-train runway. Can you talk about how maybe mechanically bridging volumes work and how that can kind of contribute more to that upside?\nZach Davis: Sure. Those bridging volumes are basically long-term contracts that helped us underpin or FID Stage 3 that have already begun before Stage 3 has begun. So those bridging volumes are in our 200 to 250 range and why we went into this year 97%, 98% contracted. So when we think about the bridging volumes, though, in the context of having some near-term volumes on a 15-year to 20-year deal, if the curve is liquid, we will get value for the curve and blend it over the 20 years or the 15 years. So those margins are incrementally up to a deal that might start with a CP of a train up and running, but we\u2019re only talking about nickels and dimes here.\nTristan Richardson: No. That\u2019s great. Thank you. Appreciate it, Zach.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll take our final question from Ben Nolan with Stifel.\nBen Nolan: Yeah. Thanks. Hey, guys. Well, for my first one, as we think about how the year plays out and appreciating that virtually everything is fixed, is there going to be any sort of cadence to how the EBITDA and the cash flow comes through or should it be pretty linear, do you think?\nZach Davis: It\u2019s never perfectly linear. We produce more in the winter months at the sites. So with that, you should expect slightly more EBITDA in the colder quarters versus the summer or the shorter seasons. But basically, it should be a year of $5.5 billion to $6 billion to EBITDA and why we don\u2019t guide on a quarterly basis. But we expect 45 million tons and we are now 99% contracted and the optimization, I\u2019m not forecasting that today. So that\u2019s probably the only thing that could create some variability quarter-to-quarter.\nBen Nolan: Okay. I appreciate that. And then for my follow-up, just on the regulatory side, obviously, this is the third time we\u2019ve been going through this process. Curious if you guys think the hurdle is getting increasingly more challenging for new projects or is it -- do you think that all of this rhetoric is changing how Washington thinks about the business?\nJack Fusco: No. Well, first, the hurdle has always been high, right? This is a very capital-intensive business. It takes years to get one of these across the finish line. It\u2019s a balancing act between capital costs and SBAs and contracted amounts and financings and everything else. We make it look easy, Ben, but it\u2019s not. The only positive thing in the past was the regulatory certainty around America and contract sanctity. And while I think this is politically motivated, I\u2019m hopeful that at the end of the day, we go back to where we were before, which is we let the market dictate which projects will survive and which ones won\u2019t. And that\u2019s where we\u2019ve always been and the market\u2019s been extremely efficient at who they\u2019re going to bet on and I would bet on Cheniere every single day.\nBen Nolan: All right. Well, and I appreciate you guys putting me in. Thanks.\nJack Fusco: Thank you and thank you all for all of your support.\nOperator: That will conclude today\u2019s call. We appreciate your participation.",

            "name": "Anatol Feygin",
            "content": "Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. The global LNG market continued to rebalance throughout 2023 as Europe navigated its energy crisis and Asia adapted to the delicate new market equilibrium amid some regional economic headwinds. Global LNG trade grew by approximately 3% from 2022, adding 10.5 million tons of supply to the overall market. Aside from 2020, global supply growth has not been this low since 2011 through 2015 period. Nevertheless, this increase in supply was broadly matched by an increase in Asian demand, which grew approximately 4% year-over-year to approximately 263 million tons per annum as the region furthers its post-pandemic return. On the supply side, only one new train came online in 2023 globally, the third train at Tangguh LNG in Indonesia. Most of the growth in LNG output last year actually came from the continued ramp-up of existing projects in the U.S. The U.S. exported 86 million tons last year, becoming the world's largest exporter in 2023, ahead of Australia and Qatar for the first time, and more than half of those volumes were produced by Cheniere. In the fourth quarter alone, U.S. exports reached record highs of nearly 24 million tons, contributing to the global market's rebalancing. Despite persistent geopolitical unrest globally and the continued phase-out of Russian pipe gas in Europe, spot price levels have decreased this winter compared to last year due to a combination of mild weather, macroeconomic fundamentals, high storage levels and sufficient LNG supply availability. In the fourth quarter, TTF averaged $13.66 an ounce and JKM $14.97, both significantly lower than levels seen in the previous two years and both have continued to trend down through the first quarter of this year. Henry Hub benchmark also decreased in the fourth quarter, falling to an average of $2.88 an ounce. For the full year 2023, TTF monthly settlement prices averaged $13.73 an MMBtu, over 66% lower year-over-year and 4.6% lower than 2021. Similarly, the 2023 average settlement price for JKM decreased 53% year-over-year to an average of $16.13, while the Henry Hub average settlement price was $2.74, down approximately 59% from $6.64 in 2022 during the height of the energy crisis in Europe. Let's address the regional dynamics on the next page. With more than 65% of all U.S. LNG volumes in 2023 flowing in Europe, the region's underground storage inventories remained elevated throughout the year, easing concerns about physical market tightness amid further reductions in all other sources of gas supply to the region. Total gas supply to Europe fell 56 BCM year-on-year due mostly to the continued reduction in Russian flows, as well as heavy upstream maintenance in Norway further affecting pipe gas supply. Nonetheless, storage levels ended the calendar year at 86% full, the second highest level for the period since storage data became available in 2011. Meanwhile, gas demand in the region's key markets continued to drop, declining by nine% year-on-year in 2023, following a 12% reduction in 2022. The power sector accounted for nearly half of these reductions amid relatively mild temperatures, continued conservation efforts, improving nuclear performance and growth in renewable generation. And aside from Germany, industrial demand reductions appear to have bottomed out in 2023 throughout the region. In Asia, as I mentioned, LNG demand grew by four% or 9 million tons year-on-year, thanks to a resurgence in demand from China and other emerging economies throughout Asia. Most of the uptick in Asia's demand was largely due to a rebound in China's economy, which resulted in a 7.5% year-on-year increase in gas consumption. It was up 27 BCM. Despite a 13 BCM increase in domestic gas output and the scheduled 7 BCM ramp up in the Power of Siberia flows last year, China's reliance on LNG remained high at 25% of total gas supply. The country's imports rebounded by about 12% to 71 million tons last year, about 8.5 million tons below the peak 2021 levels. We continue to expect gradual but continued growth in gas consumption that will increase the call on LNG going forward. In addition to China, an approximately 8.5-million-ton year-on-year increase in South and Southeast Asia's imports also contributed to growing global demand last year. Thailand and India led the charge as LNG spot prices moderated and demand for gas-fired power generation reached record levels in India. Additionally, three new receiving terminals started in this region, giving the nascent import markets of the Philippines and Vietnam access to LNG, which we believe will help power their economies for years to come. LNG demand growth in Asia was partially offset by the reduced demand for LNG in Japan due to lower electricity demand and increased nuclear availability. In Japan, two nuclear reactors restarted in 2023, increasing available nuclear capacity to the highest level since the Fukushima disaster in 2011. This is a structural trend in Japan that we expect will continue to impact gas-fired power generation and consequently LNG imports over time. Let's move to the next slide where we'll consider the outlook for gas in these and other economies. As discussed, global gas demand in 2023 remained relatively flat, growing by 20 BCM or 0.05% amid tight global supplies and historically elevated prices. In contrast, global demand for coal was up 1.4% on the back of increased use in emerging and developing economies. Given the DOE action related to climate that Jack already discussed, it's worth highlighting here the simple fact that for the second year in a row, global coal consumption hit a new all-time record. Coal-fired power generation increased in 2023 despite continued coal-to-gas switching in the U.S., notable declines in Europe and significant growth in renewable generation overall, which rose over 22% globally. As shown in the lower left, more than half of the power demand growth in China and India in 2023 was supplied by coal. Coal-fired generation from these two nations alone increased by 419 terawatt hours, which is roughly equivalent to the total power generation for the entire country of France and more than 80% of the entire growth in renewable power generation seen last year. While China and India remain committed to growing gas as a primary energy source in their respective economies, tight gas supplies and higher-than-normal global LNG prices in recent years have impacted the pace of potential gas consumption growth in these developing economies. More broadly, coal remains the largest source of power generation globally and represents about two-thirds of power sector emissions and about a quarter of total emissions globally. With power demand expected to double by 2050, any hope of achieving global decarbonization and clean energy targets will require further displacement of coal use wherever possible, especially in countries like China and India. As Jack noted, natural gas holds a critical role in helping achieve these goals over the coming decades, which we expect will result in robust increases in demand for natural gas over that period, as shown by the outlooks on the central chart. The fast-growing economies in the Asia-Pacific region are expected to play the greatest role in powering gas demand beyond the 2040s, when demand from Europe and the developed world could possibly be in modest decline and regional gas supplies in Asia further deplete. The outlook for global gas demand should remain robust going into the second half of the century, because natural gas is an affordable, reliable and sustainable solution that will serve to displace coal and support the deployment of intermittent renewable energy sources. As such, in 2023 alone, we have executed over 6.5 million tons per annum of long-term agreements, representing over 119 million tons in aggregate volume of LNG between 2026 and 2050, the majority of which are with repeat customers and are structured to meet each customer's unique long-term objectives. These investment-grade counterparties include North American producers, portfolio players and Asian and European end-users, all of which seek secure, cleaner and affordable and flexible supply. Our customers sign up for decades of LNG from Cheniere because they believe in the long-term role of natural gas and they believe in Cheniere's ability to deliver the LNG reliably and responsibly. Looking ahead to 2024, as the market continues to stabilize and achieve the stable pricing necessary to ensure market access and adoption, we anticipate our premium products will continue to have broad-based appeal. With that, I'll turn the call over to Zach to review our financial results and guidance. Sure. Thanks, John. Thanks for the questions. I'll start kind of in reverse order. The market will grow what the supply allows it to grow, right? So the 10.5 million tons was a function of that supply coming into the market and being placed where it was most needed at the margin. The things that are encouraging to us and we see as kind of inexorable trends are the commitments to gas and the investments in long-dated infrastructure. Not a month goes by that we don't add a couple of regas terminals and things like gas-fired power plants are very difficult to get, turbines are difficult to get for years and that is a function of the deployment of that infrastructure globally. So we prefer a world where LNG is in those high-single, low-double-digit rates where returns for us are attractive but reasonable and the consumers can get their hands on these attractive BTUs. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, are competitive with coal and other generation sources. So we remain very optimistic. You'll see volumes going into South and Southeast Asia. You'll see the marginal kind of elastic demand come back into the market. We're already seeing that even in the early days post the Chinese New Year and we think that these are trends that will last for decades and decades to come and we have kind of those commercial -- the commercial engagements with those types of counterparties that are continuing apace. So we think the market will enjoy absorbing this volume and whether it comes online on schedule or if things are modestly delayed as they have been historically, we think that the market will show robust growth and ability to absorb this next wave. Yeah. Thanks, Jack. And thanks, Theresa. Just to pick up where Jack left off, this is the third time the DOE is doing this study. And I would say, to Jack's point, the first two are a distant memory as the U.S. goes from kind of mid-90s of millions tons per annum of capacity today to close to 200 million tons per annum. We still think -- really believe that the U.S. will be the market's first 200-million-ton exporter and we will navigate this with the DOE. A lot of the things that we have been doing for the last four years or five years on our LCA and on our environmental science and tracking the emissions profiles, providing the cargo emission tags, are all things that are new in the equation. And then, of course, just the quantum of LNG exports from the U.S. and gas dedicated to LNG exports is a new component in this equation. So we -- to Jack's point, we look forward to DOE's methodical kind of science-based review and updating its profile. But we are confident and we relay the same answer to our customers in our commercial engagements, that we are confident that Cheniere will be able to navigate whatever comes out of the DOE and continue to prosecute expansions on our timeline. So this is not new. Every time there is a pivot, whether that is a modest pivot or a more major pivot, we have these discussions, but we've navigated them for a decade plus and are confident we'll continue to do so and that's exactly the message that we give to our customers and we obviously firmly believe that. Yeah. Look, the market -- it's hard to say that these are kind of unprecedented dynamics in the sense that the amount of infrastructure that has been brought online over the last three years to five years is unprecedented over that period. So we talk about the amount of liquefaction capacity that's coming online in the back half of this decade, but again, not a month goes by that there's not a new regas terminal Europe added five, Southeast Asia has added four, Europe will now add Alexandroupolis in Greece in the coming days or weeks. So the ability to consume this volume is enormous and we're approaching a scale now relative to the current 400 million tons of exports, which obviously will grow of almost 1300 million tons per annum of import capacity. So markets like India, which have rebounded strongly as prices moderate, are now in a position to import more than twice as much volume as it imported in 2023. That was not a position that India was in in early 2020, when prices were low and it was a price elastic consumer. So I think you'll see that price elastic demand function really surprised to the upside as Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, India, et cetera, are all in a position to take meaningful incremental volumes. So quite optimistic on that front and I think we all see these liquefaction numbers coming. And again, historically, they have surprised to the downside in terms of schedule and utilization. So we'll see how the world rebalances, but it certainly has the capacity to consume essentially whatever number you think will be added to the supply side. Thanks, Spiro. This is Anatol. I'll jump in. Look, we're very comfortable with and confident in the resource and the economics of developing that resource in this nation. The challenge we have, which we've highlighted multiple times for years, is building infrastructure. And I think it's going to be a long time before anybody attempts another Mountain Valley Pipeline or equivalent out of what is an incredible resource in the Northeast, in the Marcellus and Utica. That said, you know us and we take very seriously and as a sacrosanct gas supply and the infrastructure needed to supply our facilities for decades to come and that's one of many reasons why the U.S. Gulf Coast is our home and we're very confident that Louisiana, Texas, Mid-Continent can continue to develop the resource and the infrastructure necessary to get it to us. Jack mentioned the ADCC pipeline that's moving well, obviously. Permian continues to grow and we'll need more intrastate infrastructure. We will need more interstate infrastructure as you probably saw we filed for together with our SPL application. So we're confident that the Gulf Coast will continue to be well supplied, but obviously, would prefer that other resource in the country was able to get to market as well."

            "name": "Jack Fusco",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today as we review a successful 2023 and discuss our outlook for what is setting up to be a very busy and promising 2024. In 2023, we drove exceptional results across the key strategic priorities of the company and we did so while reinforcing our track record on safety, execution and operational reliability. I'm extremely proud of my 1,600 Cheniere colleagues across operations, engineering and construction, origination and others who continue to be driven by excellence and take pride in solidifying Cheniere as best in class across our platform. We made significant strides despite some persistent macro headwinds and increased uncertainty in 2023, each largely driven by conflict, geopolitics and the evolving regulatory landscape, particularly right here in America. I'll touch on the latter in a moment, but the macro backdrop for LNG today provides a blunt yet clear reminder of the criticality of secure and stable energy supply and the value of a reliable and customer-focused operator who consistently delivers on its promises to its global stakeholders. Please turn to slide five, where I'll renew some key operational and financial achievements from the fourth quarter and full year 2023 and introduce our 2024 financial guidance. We generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.65 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year total to approximately $8.8 billion, the high end of our most recent guidance range. We generated approximately $1.1 billion of distributable cash flow in the fourth quarter and $6.5 billion for the full year, which is above the high end of our guidance range. Looking back at the original guidance provided for 2023, we beat the midpoint of each of those guidance ranges by over $500 million, once again illustrating the volatile nature of current global natural gas markets and the value of Cheniere's platform to monetize that volatility last year. For the fourth quarter, we generated approximately $1.4 billion in net income, bringing the full year total to approximately $9.9 billion. Strategically, 2023 was another year marked by significant accomplishments across the entire platform, and I'll highlight just a few of them here. First and foremost, we continue to execute on the company's long-term objectives with safety at the foundation of our actions, and in 2023, we once again demonstrated this by achieving a total recordable incident rate of 0.10, which is well within the top decile for industrial producers. We achieved this while simultaneously operating the second largest LNG platform in the world and being deep in construction on a 10-plus million ton per annum expansion project. These safety results are a source of tremendous pride for me and that pride should be felt by all the company stakeholders. We produced and recorded a record 169 LNG cargoes in the fourth quarter, bringing the total to a record 637 cargoes for the full year. Total production was in line with our forecast of about 45 million tons, inclusive of the successful major maintenance turnaround that's being passed over the summer. Europe remained the premium market for U.S. cargoes across 2023, as 73% of the volume produced at our facilities was delivered to Europe. Five new long-term customer contracts commenced over the course of 2023, representing approximately 3.7 million tons per annum. And earlier this month, we commenced our 1.1 million ton per annum PETRONAS contract, which was tied to Train 6 on the very first day of the DFCD window, holding to our standard of always meeting our customer commitment. On the E&C front, Corpus Christi Stage 3 is progressing on an accelerated timeline and we continue to forecast first LNG production from Train 1 at the end of this year. In 2023, we advanced total project completion to over 50%. I'm extremely pleased with the progress we continue to make together with Bechtel on Stage 3, and I'm optimistic for further schedule improvements over time. We took some important steps last year in preparation for Stage 3 to commence commissioning and operations. Construction on the ADCC Pipeline being built from Agua Dulce to support Stage 3 is progressing well and the pipeline is expected to be in service in the third quarter in advance of Train 1's accelerated startup. In addition, in the second half of last year, we purchased for approximately $100 million an existing 400-megawatt power plant in Corpus Christi, which is located on our property, in order to help mitigate risks associated with our increased power purchasing needs once Stage 3 commences operations. These milestones, coupled with the construction progress on the project, reinforces my confidence in Stage 3's timeline, improving over time with first LNG this year and meaningful LNG production added to our portfolio in 2025. Our commercial momentum continued in 2023 as LNG buyers the world over helped get the commercialization of the SPL expansion project off to an incredibly promising start. We have signed long-term agreements with six counterparties across Asia, Europe and Canada for an aggregate of over 6.5 million tons per annum, effectively commercializing all of Train 7. We are encouraged by the market's early reception, especially since the majority of these counterparties are repeat customers. I view it as a recognition of the value of Cheniere's reputation. We are focused on furthering development of the project in 2024 across commercialization, regulatory and financing work streams, with a focus on submitting our full permit application with the FERC before the end of this quarter. Throughout 2023, Zach and his team continue to execute on the 2020 Vision Capital Allocation Plan, making significant progress across the key pillars of the plan, debt reduction, capital return and disciplined growth investments. We've paid down over a $1 billion of debt and achieved investment-grade ratings throughout our structure. We bought back almost 10 million shares for approximately $1.5 billion and declared dividends of $1.66 per share and we invested approximately $1.5 billion into Stage 3. We've made great strides on the comprehensive plan since announcing it in late 2022. And now, turning our focus and attention to 2024, I am pleased to introduce our 2024 financial guidance of $5.5 billion to $6.0 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA, $2.9 billion to $3.4 billion in distributable cash flow and $3.15 per unit to $3.35 per unit distribution of CQP. We, again, are forecasting annual results that are above the midpoint of our run rate 9-train guidance and our expected results this year have a tremendous amount of visibility, given on how highly contracted we are. On the CQP distribution guidance, consistent with the prior messaging, we intend to maintain the $3.10 base distribution and adjust the variable component beginning in 2024 in order to begin preserving some cash and fortifying the CQP balance sheet as the SPL expansion project gains momentum. Zach will provide more details on the 2024 guidance in a few minutes. Turn now to slide six, where I will address the DOE news and our response. As you're all aware, the Department of Energy recently announced it would suspend making determinations on authorizations for LNG exports to non-free trade agreement countries, pending an update to the economic and environmental analysis underpinning its public interest determination methodology. While this decision does not currently impact our expansion projects or our FERC processes at Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi, it does introduce regulatory and permitting uncertainty into the U.S. LNG industry as a whole. I firmly believe that a fair and transparent regulatory framework is essential for the future development of natural gas infrastructure in the United States, particularly liquefaction capacity, given the scale of investment, commercial support and time required to bring these projects online. With that said, we believe we will secure all necessary regulatory approvals for mid-scale Trains 8 and 9, and the SPL expansion project within our expected timelines, as we have for more than a decade under multiple administrations. To be clear, the DOE action has not slowed down our expansion projects at either site. We are full steam ahead on Corpus Christi Trains 8 and 9 and the SPL expansion project development. We expect to file the FERC application for SPL very soon, and Corpus Christi Trains 8 and 9 are in advanced stages in the FERC approval process. The environmental assessment for Trains 8 and 9 is scheduled for receipt by the end of March, and we just received a letter of determination from PHMSA, a key agency in the FERC process last week. We remain confident that our previous timelines won't be materially impacted and we will maximize the efficiency with having Bechtel on site already through Stage 3. Having spent the last eight years at Cheniere, I've never been more confident in the critical role of U.S. LNG in the global energy market, and I firmly believe the DOE studies will come to the same conclusion given, one, the importance of long-term energy security, two, the opportunities for global decarbonization through coal-to-gas switching for power generation and the critical role that dispatchable gas-fired power plants plays in backstopping intermittent renewables, three, low and stable domestic natural gas prices, and of course, four, the incredible economic benefits created in the communities where we live and work. Global energy markets are calling for additional LNG supply. The U.S. is significantly advantaged to answer this call with our abundant and low-cost natural resources, flexibility and affordability of U.S. volumes, and until recently, the reliability and certainty of the U.S. regulatory regime. Gulf Coast LNG positions the U.S. as a leader in facilitating energy security and worldwide emissions reductions. This is a generational opportunity, something we should be proud of and working to maximize, not restrict. With that, I'll hand it over to Anatol to discuss the LNG market. Thank you all again for your continued support of Cheniere. Good morning, Jeremy. Thanks, Jeremy. Brian, this is Jack. While we're not going to guide upwards of the 45 million tons today, I'm always amazed at what my operations folks can deliver. So whether it's optimizing the trains or our maintenance schedule, we -- they have just constantly outperformed. So we're looking now, as Zach mentioned, at $100 or so million for debottlenecking. One of the things I find really promising is, we're looking at a new technology of our fin fans. Those are the fans that we use to cool the refrigerant that liquefy the natural gas and we think there's a big opportunity there. So we'll be trying that out in earnest this year and I hope to have more news for you on later calls. Theresa, I think, I'm going to just start with some overall comments, and then I'll turn it over to Anatol. But I have to say this isn't really new. We've been through multiple administrations here at Cheniere. We've been through multiple studies on the public interest in exporting America's natural gas. What is shocking and new is over the last eight years, I think, Cheniere has proven all the benefits to America and to our allies over exporting U.S. LNG. And I find it appalling that we need scientists to tell us theoretically, using theories and hypotheses, of the benefits or not. But as you know, we know that there are -- those benefits are factual, they're proven, they were witnessed by the world. So I really look forward to seeing this studies report. I look forward to the comment period so we can get the record straight and accurate. I'm hopeful that cooler heads ultimately prevail and that the facts will be evident and this pause will be a distant memory. But with that, I'll turn it over to Anatol. He can tell you a little bit about what our conversations have been with our customers. No. Well, first, the hurdle has always been high, right? This is a very capital-intensive business. It takes years to get one of these across the finish line. It's a balancing act between capital costs and SBAs and contracted amounts and financings and everything else. We make it look easy, Ben, but it's not. The only positive thing in the past was the regulatory certainty around America and contract sanctity. And while I think this is politically motivated, I'm hopeful that at the end of the day, we go back to where we were before, which is we let the market dictate which projects will survive and which ones won't. And that's where we've always been and the market's been extremely efficient at who they're going to bet on and I would bet on Cheniere every single day. Thank you and thank you all for all of your support."

            "content": "Thanks, Anatol, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and key financial accomplishments and introduce our financial guidance for 2024. Turn to slide 12. For the fourth quarter and full year 2023, we generated net income of approximately $1.4 billion and $9.9 billion, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.65 billion and $8.8 billion, and distributable cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively. With today's results, our full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA results were at the high end of our most recent guidance range and we exceeded the high end of the range on distributable cash flow, mainly attributed to higher margins captured on open capacity and optimization upstream and downstream of the plant. In addition, we have now reported positive net income on a quarterly and cumulative trailing four-quarter basis five quarters in a row. As compared to 2022, our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results continue to reflect a higher proportion of our LNG being sold under long-term contracts with less volumes being sold into short-term markets, as well as the further moderation of international gas prices relative to what we experienced in 2022. These impacts were partially offset by certain portfolio optimization activities that our teams were able to achieve throughout the year. During the fourth quarter and full year, we recognized in income 618 TBtu and 2,353 TBtu of physical LNG, respectively, which included 607 TBtu and 2,318 TBtu from our projects, a record for the full year, and 11 TBtu and 35 TBtu sourced from third parties, respectively. Approximately 90% and 87% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SBA or IPM agreements, with initial terms greater than 10 years, respectively. While we have many significant achievements to highlight from 2023, I'm particularly proud of my team's focused execution on our 2020 Vision Capital Allocation Plan. We deployed approximately $5 billion towards balance sheet management, shareholder returns and accretive growth in 2023 alone, while maintaining strong available liquidity going into this year. In aggregate, since updating our Capital Allocation Plan in September 2022 with the target of $20 billion of cash deployment through 2026 and $20 per share of run rate DCF, we have now deployed over $8 billion. Execution under the plan got off to a fast start in early 2023 when we achieved investment-grade ratings at both of our parent entities, bringing the entire Cheniere complex to investment-grade status. And in June, we issued our inaugural corporate investment-grade bond, placing $1.4 billion of unsecured notes at CQP. These milestones follow approximately $8 billion of deleveraging over the last three years, from approximately $32 billion of debt at our peak to now under $24 billion. During the fourth quarter, we repaid $50 million of long-term indebtedness, further redeeming a portion of the senior secured notes due in 2024 at SPL, and bringing our total long-term debt paydown for the year to approximately $1.2 billion. We plan to address the remaining balance of the SPL 2024 notes with cash on hand within CQP early this year, after which point we will have addressed all maturities in the complex for the year. We have already begun strategizing around the 2025 maturities we have at both SPL and CCH, and as always, we will evaluate opportunities to efficiently refinance or delever throughout the year. The buyback plan is working as designed and enabling us to be opportunistic. During the fourth quarter and full year 2023, we repurchased an aggregate of approximately 2 million and 9.5 million shares of common stock for approximately $339 million and $1.5 billion, respectively. As the share price has provided greater opportunities so far this year compared to the fourth quarter 2023, deployment under the share repurchase plan has accelerated. In year-to-date or in just a month and a half or so, we have already deployed nearly $500 million, which is more than we did in any quarter in 2023, repurchasing almost 3 million shares so far, bringing our total shares outstanding to under $235 million currently. We will continue deploying the now under $2 billion remaining under the plan over the next year or so. With the expectation, we will get to the cumulative one-to-one share repurchase to debt paydown ratio and complete the current $4 billion authorization ahead of its three-year window, at which point the focus will primarily be on updating the buyback plan again with the Board while maintaining our IG balance sheet across the complex as we prepare for our creative growth initiatives at Corpus and Sabine in the coming years. We also declared $1.66 per common share in dividends for 2023, a nearly 15% increase year-over-year, having increased our quarterly dividend by 10% in Q3, consistent with our stated target of 10% annual dividend growth. Over time, we intend to steadily increase our overall payout ratio as our platform grows, while still maintaining the financial flexibility essential to our capital allocation plan and growth objectives. During the quarter, we funded approximately $467 million of CapEx at our Stage 3 project, bringing total spend to approximately $1.5 billion for the year and a little over $3 billion in total for the project. While front-loading the equity spend has enabled considerable interest savings, we still have over $3 billion available on our CCH term loan that we plan to utilize over time as the project progresses towards full completion in 2026 and we expect to spend between $1.5 and $2 billion in Stage 3 CapEx this year. Turn now to slide 13, where I will discuss our 2024 guidance and outlook for the year. Today, we are introducing our full year 2024 guidance ranges of $5.5 billion to $6 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $2.9 billion to $3.4 billion in distributable cash flow. As we've been clear about on recent calls, 2024 represents our most contracted year-to-date, as all contracts signed to underpin our existing 45-million-ton platform have commenced, as well as some bridging volumes tied to contracts signed in support of our growth projects. It's likely 2024 will represent a trough year for EBITDA after being down sequentially since 2022, as we expect to move upward post-2024 as Stage 3 commences and eventually reaches run rate in 2026 and beyond. With very little unsold capacity remaining throughout the year, these ranges largely reflect our 9-train run rate guidance adjusted for a higher proportion of volumes sold under long-term contracts or bridging volumes, as well as some forward selling of spot cargoes at higher international gas prices. These positive adjustments are partially offset by the prepayment and cancellation of the Chevron TUA and some incremental O&M costs related to our planned maintenance program. We expect to produce approximately 45 million tons of LNG this year, inclusive of planned maintenance at both sites. We remain optimistic we will achieve first LNG from train one of Stage 3 this year, but that would not impact our revenues or EBITDA in 2024, as it will likely remain in commissioning through year-end. In terms of portfolio optimization activities, we include any such transactions already completed in the guidance, but we do not forecast additional [Technical Difficulty] 2022. We remains on track as we continue to execute on the plan this year and credit those to our commercial team who have sold our 2% open capacity going into this year, which has come down from 50 TBtu to 15 TBtu since the November call, highlighting that despite the recent drop in global gas indices, our EBITDA forecast remains above the $5.5 billion midpoint of our 9-train run rate guidance. As always, our results could be impacted by the timing of certain cargoes around year-end, as well as incremental margin from further optimization upstream and downstream of our facilities. Our distributable cash flow for 2024 could also be affected by any changes in the tax code under the IRA. However, the guidance provided today is based on the current IRA tax law guidance and assumes we qualify for the minimum corporate tax of 15% this year. As the year progresses, we will likely tighten our ranges consistent with what we've done in the last two guidance cycles. At CQP, our full year 2024 distribution guidance range is $3.15 per common unit to $3.35 per common unit, which maintains our base distribution of $3.10 and a variable distribution of between $0.05 and $0.25. As we have discussed publicly for the last year, by adjusting the variable component of our base plus variable distribution this year, we are preserving cash and balance sheet capacity at CQP in anticipation of funding the $10-plus billion SPL expansion project according to our disciplined capital investment parameters, which call for financing the project 50% with cash flow, while maintaining investment-grade ratings at both SPL and CQP, all within a traditional MLP structure. This DPU guidance keeps us on our previously assumed FID timeline and should be viewed as an indication of our confidence in the attractiveness and viability of the SPL expansion project. In the near-term, deleveraging at CQP or SPL can be considered early investments in the SPL expansion project until we are in a position to formally sanction the project, raise financing and begin construction, which we plan for in 2026. We expect the accretive SPL expansion project could increase the run rate distributable cash flow at CQP to over $5 per unit, a win not only for CQP unit holders but LNG shareholders as well, since we are in the high splits of the MLP, meaning approximately 75% of the incremental cash flow would accrue to CEI, and further meaningfully increase our run rate DCF per share target over time, as it was not baked into the original 2020 Vision. Looking beyond this year, the Cheniere story remains the same. Our highly contracted business model is built upon long-duration, fixed-fee, investment-grade, take-or-pay-style cash flows, which underpin the $40 billion natural gas infrastructure platform we operate today. As we pursue brownfield expansions, our approach will be consistent with that of the first over 55 million tons, adhering to our disciplined investment parameters so that our cash flows and our value proposition remain insulated from whatever transitory supply and demand imbalances may occur over the next decade plus. Our company provides investors with exposure to LNG the theme, more so than the commodity, and it is inherent stability and long-term visibility in our contracted cash flows, growth and shareholder returns that should enable us to continue to deliver meaningful value to our stakeholders for decades to come. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions. Hi, John. It's Zach. And I'll just say the $500 million range is basically we're keeping the same cadence that we've had for the last couple of years with the $500 million. It's still under 10% of the EBITDA. But it's safe to assume that we're going to start right now around the midpoint of that range and from there, I would say there's a few variables, even though the open capacity is so small and $1 CMI move in margins is only $15 million. With most of the year still ahead of us, $1 move in Henry Hub can move EBITDA in the lifting margin by around $100 million and just year-end timing of deliveries, that can move things around $100 million as well, even though a lot of those end-of-year cargoes are even locked in at pretty attractive rates by the team. When it comes to the upside and downside to the high-end and low-end, on the low-end, it would really have to be something unforeseen today operationally that got us that close to the low-end considering how locked in we are. So it would be maybe a longer maintenance cycle than we even had last year, which we don't foresee or a tougher hurricane season or something of that sort. On the upstream -- on the upside, I'd just say, we've been very clear from the get-go. We don't guide on optimization upstream and downstream of the plants that's not locked in. So as that accrues, ideally through the year, even though margins are lower, Henry Hub is lower and volatility has moderated, that should help us get to the upside and the, yeah, we'll stay optimistic on seeing if we can get a couple more cargoes out through the course of the year. It's been in the hundreds of millions of dollars, Jeremy, in terms of the optimization. And I'd say hundreds of millions of dollars, both in the upstream and downstream side. Mind you, Henry Hub was significantly up in 2022, moderated a bit last year and it's even further down today. So we'll see how much can be there. And then on the other side, yeah, we have a ton of IPM deals, DES deals. So we'll optimize those as we see fit and subcharter out any of our length in our shipping portfolio, which in the past has added hundreds of millions of dollars. Mind you, even that market has moderated as well in terms of the volatility. But when you add those two things together, it would really take, yeah, great execution and some opportunistic moments throughout the year for us to get to the high end of the range. Yeah. That's right. We were pretty clear for quite some time now, as we thought about this year, it'd be the closest we would be to the run rate and considering how proactive we were going into this year, and now that we're only down to 15 TBtu, we're still above the midpoint of the run rate range for 9 trains and we don't even have the TUA from Chevron anymore. So this is -- where we expected it to be, it was baked into the 2020 Vision and the $20-plus-billion of cash flow through 2026 and we'll see how things play out on the optimization side, but it's not baked into this guidance today. Sure. So as we thought about the variable adjustment, I would say, over the last two years, we were incredibly efficient with our cash inside the CQP. And with the distributions, including the variable being over $4 both years, we probably distributed out almost $700 million more than even the run rate DCF per unit guidance that we give. So now it's time, as we're getting closer to officially filing with the FERC for the Sabine expansion and are targeting that 2026 FID, that we're going to start retaining some of the cash and bringing down the variable. We're saving around, let's say, $700 million. And a large portion of that will actually just go into paying down a bit of debt that's coming due, giving us this flexibility financially to add leverage capacity once we FID the project, stay with that, let's say, 50-50 debt-to-equity during construction and maintain the base distribution throughout while still being investment grade at Sabine and CQP. So we're trying to thread a needle there, and to do that, we need to start planning now. Mind you, some of the cash that's retained is also going into development of supporting the feed and getting Sabine expansion ready for FID and there's even $100 million or so baked in there for debottlenecking purposes. We think we've found some ways to get to the higher end of the 4.9 to 5.1 range on the first exchange that hopefully can pay dividends to us in the coming years. So there's a few things in there, but it is mainly debt pay down in the near-term to add leverage capacity and flexibility in the long-term. Mind you, it's still $2 billion of distributions coming out of CQP this year with $1.2 billion of that going to CEI. But if we can pull all this off and build this project and get to that over $5 DPU, we're talking about almost $2 billion of consolidated EBITDA and we're talking about almost a $1 billion of DCF to CEI. So it's a win-win for all parties. Sure. So I would just say we're still at $20-plus-billion of available cash through 2026, and there are some puts and takes. We've made some more money in years like the past year. This year was always planned to be highly contracted. And then we assumed guaranteed completion dates for Stage 3, meaning not even -- Train 7 wasn't even going to come online until 2027, outside of that period of time. So all in, we're still over $20 billion. We've deployed over $8 billion. So about 40% in about 30% of the time. But the main thing to focus on is really that excess cash and how we're going to deploy that going forward. And as you can tell, with some of the debt pay down, which will be less than we even did this year, staying inside of CQP, CEI is going to mainly be focused on catching up on the buyback and completing the equity funding of Stage 3. At this point, we've done over $2 billion of buybacks, but we've done over $3.5 billion of debt pay down. So there's still a $1.5 billion, give or take, that still needs to occur for that catch up of the one-to-one. So we'll be pretty focused on that this year. Case in point, the program was set up to be opportunistic at times like this and that's why the shares outstanding is trickling down. And by the end of the year or early next year, yeah, we'll probably have to upsize the plan again and keep on marching on this long-term path to eventually 200 million shares in the long-term run rate. I think what we planned in 2022 was planned for distributing out a lot of cash efficiently in 2022 and 2023, and then being in a position where we can do a mega project inside an MLP. So when we set the $3.10 distribution as the base, we intend to uphold that. Obviously, this year, we're actually even above that. We had enough cash to be able to meet our objectives going into developing and preparing for the Sabine expansion. And so we're going to distribute that out to CEI and our unit holders. But when it comes down to FID-ing the project in the next couple of years, the goal is to maintain the base distribution, stay investment-grade everywhere and fund the project within cash flow. So this all kind of works, which is pretty amazing for an MLP, but one with six trains fully up and running, it works quite well. And then as you think about the $3.10 base distribution or the $3.25 this year, yeah, again, we're still talking about $2 billion of distribution and an over 6% yield. So we were cognizant of making sure that that was competitive and kept us going in the right direction with our unit holders and our own stake in CQP. Sure. Those bridging volumes are basically long-term contracts that helped us underpin or FID Stage 3 that have already begun before Stage 3 has begun. So those bridging volumes are in our 200 to 250 range and why we went into this year 97%, 98% contracted. So when we think about the bridging volumes, though, in the context of having some near-term volumes on a 15-year to 20-year deal, if the curve is liquid, we will get value for the curve and blend it over the 20 years or the 15 years. So those margins are incrementally up to a deal that might start with a CP of a train up and running, but we're only talking about nickels and dimes here. It's never perfectly linear. We produce more in the winter months at the sites. So with that, you should expect slightly more EBITDA in the colder quarters versus the summer or the shorter seasons. But basically, it should be a year of $5.5 billion to $6 billion to EBITDA and why we don't guide on a quarterly basis. But we expect 45 million tons and we are now 99% contracted and the optimization, I'm not forecasting that today. So that's probably the only thing that could create some variability quarter-to-quarter."

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Randy Bhatia. Please go ahead.\nRandy Bhatia: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Cheniere's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. The slide presentation and access to the webcast for today's call are available at cheniere.com. Joining me this morning are Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO; Anatol Feygin, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Zach Davis, Executive Vice President and CFO; and other members of the Cheniere senior management team. Before we begin, I would like to remind all listeners that our remarks, including answers to your questions, may contain forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from what is described in these statements. Slide 2 of our presentation contains a discussion of those forward-looking statements and associated risks. In addition, we may include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the appendix of the slide presentation. As part of our discussion of Cheniere's results, today's call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP, or CQP. We do not intend to cover CQP's results separately from those of Cheniere Energy, Inc. The call agenda is shown on Slide 3. Jack will begin with operating and financial highlights. Anatol will then provide an update on the LNG market, and Zach will review our financial results and 2023 guidance. After prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO.\nJack Fusco: Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today as we review our third quarter results and improved full year 2023 outlook. Before we get started, I would like to acknowledge the tragedies of war taking place around the world. Our thoughts and prayers are with those whose lives have been and continue to be impacted by these devastating and heartbreaking events. These events are contributing to disruptions, risk, uncertainty and volatility in the energy markets around the world. International gas supply sources and the critical infrastructure, enabling cross-border trade have become focal points with risk to this supply and its access increasingly reflected in price and volatility across international gas benchmarks in recent weeks. As the operator of the second largest LNG platform in the world, stable and reliable operations at our facilities have arguably never been more critical than it is today. As you all know, ensuring stable and reliable operations at our facilities with safety as a foundation has been my central focus since becoming CEO in 2016. When I joined Cheniere just begun LNG operations, producing its first LNG cargo that February. Today, we produce about two cargoes every single day. And during the third quarter, we produced our 3,000th cargo of LNG becoming the fastest LNG producer in history to achieve that milestone. I'm extremely proud of the work we do at Cheniere as a result of that work are providing tangible benefits in the lives of millions of people around the world. Our customers can take comfort knowing that my focus and the focus of my approximately 1,600 Cheniere colleagues remains on maintaining best-in-class operations to help ensure energy security for our 30-plus customers throughout five continents. Turn now to Slide 5, where I'll review key operational and financial highlights from the third quarter 2023, as well as cover another long-term SBA we announced this morning. We achieved successes across the Cheniere platform during the third quarter, generating consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.7 billion, distributable cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion and net income of approximately $1.7 billion. We exported a total of 152 cargoes, an increase relative to the second quarter as we had lower maintenance in the third quarter. As I just mentioned, we also produced our 3,000th cargo during the quarter and maintained our perfect track record of foundation customer cargo deliveries. These operational milestones are a tremendous source of pride for Cheniere and serve to further distance our reputation from the competition. Looking ahead to the balance of 2023, our forecast has improved slightly. And while we aren't raising our full year guidance to date, we are currently tracking to the high end of the $8.3 billion to $8.8 billion of consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion of DCF ranges. The improvement to our outlook is mainly driven by portfolio optimization activities the timing of some expenses to a lesser extent, from higher marketing margins than previously forecasted. Zach will provide more color on the guidance, but we have excellent visibility into the balance for the year and are confident in our ability to finish the year at the high end of the ranges. On the commercial front, Anatol and his team continue to build momentum for the SPL expansion project as we signed a long-term contract with BASF in August, early volumes under the offtake agreement will begin in 2026, ramping to the full 0.8 million tons with commercial start of the first train 7 of the SPL expansion project and extending until 2043.  This contract illustrates the rapid evolution of LNG into Europe as it's a long-term contract executed directly with an industrial consumer in Germany, which only a year ago, didn't have a single LNG import terminal. And I hope you saw earlier this morning, we announced our second 20-year agreement with Foran, building upon the SBA we executed with it in late 2021, that commenced earlier this year. Of the almost 6 million tons of long-term offtake executed year-to-date, over 75% of that annual total is contracted with repeat customers who clearly value their long-term partnership with Cheniere. Testament to the reputation and trust we have earned with our long-term customers. This foreign contract is for approximately 0.9 million tons will extend until 2050 and notably marks the first SBA tied to the second train of the SPL expansion, Train 8 as commercialization on the first train has effectively been completed. We are extremely excited about the market's response to the SPL expansion project and demand for additional capacity from Cheniere. Since announcing the project in February, we have signed nearly 6 million tons per annum of long-term contracts in support of the project and our best-in-class long-term contracted portfolio, all with investment-grade counterparties, and I'm confident we have more to do this year. As always, we remain laser focused on developing that project to meet or exceed our disciplined capital investment parameters in order to deliver the world-class contracted infrastructure returns that our shareholders are accustomed to. While on the topic of return, Zach and his team continued to progress on our comprehensive 2020 vision capital allocation plan. During the third quarter, we paid down another $50 million of long-term debt. We bought back approximately 2.2 million shares for $357 million and we increased our quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.435 for the third quarter. On Stage 3, we continue to equity fund that project, investing over $300 million during the quarter with a total of over $2.5 billion invested to date. Speaking of Stage 3, now turn to Slide 6, where I'm pleased to provide an update on the accelerated progress we are seeing. Since activities on the project moved more heavily into the construction phase a few quarters ago, we've indicated that certain of these construction activities were taking place ahead of plan as we are now over 44% complete overall across engineering, procurement and construction. While we remain in single digits in terms of percentage completion of construction for the overall project, it's becoming increasingly clear that the project is tracking month ahead of the guaranteed schedule. I'm optimistic we'll be commissioning on Train 1 with first LNG production by the end of 2024 and forecast all 7 trains to achieve substantial completion by the end of 2026. We are extremely excited about the progress Spectra was making on State Street, we look forward to maintaining our accelerating progress in order to again deliver LNG to the market, well ahead of schedule, increasing our operating capacity again starting in 2025. On the earnings call in August, I mentioned Stage 3 was beginning to take shape, as the first structural still was erected in our Train 1 coal boxes that arrived on site. One can certainly appreciate the progress that's been made since then from the photos on this slide. All Train 1 coal boxes have been set in place structural steel installation is advancing and piping and electrical installation has commenced.  With the excellent progress made to date, head count of over 1,500 personnel on site each day, and the One Team culture firmly established between Cheniere and Bechtel. I'm confident in the team's ability to maintain focus continue on the accelerated schedule to deliver Corpus Christi Stage 3 safely and ahead of schedule. With that, I'll hand it over to Anatol to discuss the LNG market. Thank you again for your continued support of Cheniere.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. While the LNG market kicked off the third quarter with prices reflecting the relatively subdued demand of the shoulder season, unprecedented early winter gas procurement in Europe, coupled with threats of potential supply disruptions globally, resulted in increased volatility and higher pricing throughout August and September. Prices remain elevated relative to pre '21 as the market is still precariously balanced, sensitive to any sign of disruption given the lack of spare supply capacity in the system, which is expected to continue for the next few years. The proposed strikes at the Australian LNG export facilities, representing approximately 10% of the global LNG market, garnering significant coverage during the quarter as the market tried to gauge the scale and length of any potential disruption to global flows. Fortunately, these risks were largely inverted and LNG exports continued to flow through the end of the quarter. Nevertheless, even the threat of disruption led to significant volatility in LNG prices, which was further exacerbated by the about 48% decline in Norwegian piped gas to Europe in September following extensive maintenance at the brownfield and the [indiscernible] gas processing plant. As a result, despite elevated storage inventories throughout the region, volatility persisted as TTF spot price has experienced some fairly significant swings throughout the quarter. The maintenance in Norway supported prices from early June, with July settling at $11.30 in MMBtu, while August settled over 25% lower at $830 an M, as Norwegian volumes returned only to rebound in September, which settled at $11.5 amid concerns around the Australian strikes as well as additional unplanned Norwegian maintenance. Still TTF prices remained at pre-Russian-Ukraine war levels during the quarter and continued to edge higher with futures settling October above $12 an M.  Meanwhile, JKM prices largely tracked TTF throughout the third quarter, ultimately settling September slightly below TTF at $11.20. However, more recently, JKM futures settled October higher at $13.30 due to the uncertainty around the potential industrial action in Australia as well as increased demand from China and India. Prices have since climbed further as indications of winter demand started to emerge towards the end of the quarter with JKM November trading around $14 to $15 an M. This is in stark contrast to Henry Hub prices, which averaged $2.55 an M during the quarter as inventories held above the 5-year average. These price levels continue to support the attractiveness of U.S. LNG globally. Unfortunately, threats of further disruptions in global gas markets remain ongoing, exposing key risks to an increasingly susceptible market that already lost 12 Bs a day of Russian last year. Furthermore, the recent lease at the Baltic Connector add to market apprehension highlighting the critical need for the development of sufficient capacity globally in order to meet elastic demand and ensure the security of supply globally for the long term. Let's address the regional dynamics on the next page. During the third quarter and for the first time in 2 years, Europe's LNG imports were lower year-over-year. Imports were near 7% or 1.8 million tons lower in the third quarter due largely to the same fundamental reasons we discussed previously, including high storage levels, reduced gas use across sectors due to price elasticity as well as conservation efforts, plus increased renewables generation. EU gas storage levels continue to grow nearing full as of early October, while lower economic activity put downward pressure on both industrial demand and electricity generation. Demand for gas fired power dropped by nearly 20% in Europe's key markets amid renewable power generation, which was 12% higher year-on-year. As a result, the reduced gas storage fill requirements coupled with the lower gas demand year-on-year, more than compensated for the further reduction in Russian pipe supply and the extended maintenance in Norway, allowing Asia to reenter the market and pull some additional LNG cargoes from the Atlantic Basin, as shown in the upper middle and right charts.  However, the cross base on price spreads throughout the quarter were not wide enough to drive meaningful volume away from Europe towards Asia. Total LNG imports in Asia grew over 4% or 2.7 million tons year-on-year in the third quarter, driven by a rebound in imports to China and India as prices softened and high summer temperatures boosted spot purchases. However, lower imports across the JKT market largely offset the significant gains seen in China and other emerging Asian markets, as shown in the lower left chart. In fact, imports into the key growth markets of China and India were 21% and 27% higher in Q3, respectively. In China, gas demand picked up during the quarter, primarily due to the year-on-year recovery in gas-fired power generation, following a drought that reduced hydro generation. Despite the higher demand, gas demand recovery in the industrial sector remains subdued, with consumption still below 2021 levels. Long-term fundamentals remain bullish for the Chinese market due to favorable policy targets and a massive gas infrastructure build-out as we described in previous calls. This year alone, China has added 9 million tons of regas capacity across three new terminals, bringing the total to 110 MTPA with another 95 MTPA under construction. Similarly, the country continues to expand its gas-fired power generation fleet with 46 gigawatts currently under construction on top of the existing 121 gigawatts. In India, it prolonged the heat wave and below average rainfall during the annual monsoon season increased the region's call in LNG. India reported 6 million tons in the third quarter. 1.3 million tons higher year-on-year as spot LNG prices moderated, incentivizing downstream gas use in the fertilizer and power sectors. Gas-fired generation was up 48% year-on-year in July and August, leading domestic players to issue tenders for cargoes to feed power demand. Furthermore, the new 6.5 MTPA Dhamra LNG terminal, the first in India East Coast ramped up to import 10 cargoes since starting commercial operations in May, ending to total imports in the quarter. The terminal which raised the country's regas capacity to 44 MTPA should enhance gas availability in Northeastern India, as connections to the grid improved, making gas more accessible to city gas distributors as well as refineries and fertilizer facilities. India's regas capacity is expected to reach 63 million tons, and that, along with the additional 11,000 kilometers of pipelines under development could make the country a top 3 LNG importer before 2040. In contrast, JKT imports dropped 11% or 3.7 million tons during the quarter, following previous declines and offsetting much of the gains in Asia. Year-to-date, JKT imports are 7.5 million tons lower versus last year, due largely to increased nuclear availability in Japan and Korea. Structural factor we have discussed previously. Japan's nuclear availability reached its highest level since the Fukushima disaster, and we expect this to present headwinds for gas power generation and LNG demand growth going forward. Accordingly, Japan's long-term gas demand is expected to decline gradually through 2040. Let's now elaborate on our updated expectations for long-term supply and demand on the next slide. As noted previously, the energy trilemma, especially with the market's heightened focus on long-term energy security has led to significant long-term LNG contracting in the past 18 or so months. These contracts signal the need for further investment in liquefaction capacity and serve to underpin some of the recent project FIDs.  As a result, we now see a significant amount of new capacity currently under construction. While this is expected to help reverse the systemic market tightening that has resulted from the curtailment of Russian volumes over the last 2 years, we believe that further LNG supply is needed to fully meet demand in 2028 and beyond which we expect to be fulfilled with some of the proposed pre-FID export projects, of course, including our own expansion plans at Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi. The concentration of FID is taking place this year next along with the start of delayed projects in East and West Africa, should help make LNG more accessible to price-sensitive markets while also making the industry more resilient in the fact base of supply disruptions or major geopolitical upsets, such as those threatening the market balances today. And just as liquefaction development has been active this year, the same is true for the regas side of the business.  Market players continue to develop import capacity across Europe and Asia which in total is expected to increase by 50% by 2030. We continue to forecast healthy demand for LNG over the coming decades with Europe sustaining its growth through the midterm and Asia driving future growth over the long term. As we've discussed before, we expect South and Southeast Asia as well as China to drive future demand growth as LNG plays a critical role in the economic prosperity, energy availability and decarbonization efforts in these regions. Overall, we estimate that by 2040, more than 130 MTPA of additional supplies needed beyond what is under construction today, which is due in part to the decline in production from legacy projects where feedstock availability and upstream developments appear limited going forward. For all these reasons, we believe overall market conditions remain constructive for Gulf Coast LNG and at Cheniere, we remain resolute in building on the commercial successes of recent years to support our capacity growth.  In 2023 alone, we have signed almost 6 million tonnes per annum with customers across Europe and Asia including today's announcement of our second 20-year SBA with Foran. This contract could very well extend into the second half of this century. Further evidencing our customers and the market's conviction in the long-term role of natural gas in the global energy mix and the need for further development of LNG capacity globally. With that, I'll turn the call over to Zach to review our financial results and guidance.\nZach Davis: Thanks, Anatol, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our third quarter 2023 results and key financial accomplishments, which are the result of our team's commitment to operational excellence and financial discipline, the long-term outlook as we continue to deliver upon our stated objectives of supplying the world with much needed LNG, while creating long-term value for our stakeholders. Turn to Slide 12. For the third quarter, we generated net income of approximately $1.7 billion, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.7 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion. Our third quarter results continue to reflect a higher proportion of our LNG being sold under long-term contracts with less volumes being sold into short-term markets as well as the further moderation of international gas prices relative to last year.  Once again, these impacts were partially offset by certain portfolio optimization activities, upstream and downstream of our facilities. During the third quarter, we recognized an income 555 TBtu of physical LNG, including 545 TBtu from our projects and 10 TBtu sourced from third parties. Approximately 89% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SPA or IPM agreements with initial terms greater than 10 years. As a reminder, our reported net income is impacted by the unrealized noncash derivative impacts to our revenue and cost of sales line items, which are primarily related to the mismatch of accounting methodology for the purchase of natural gas and the corresponding sale of LNG under our long-term IPM agreements. The decline in international gas price curves quarter-over-quarter led to a lower mark-to-market valuation of the future liabilities associated with these agreements, increasing our net income.  With today's results, we have earned cumulative net income of approximately $12.4 billion for the trailing 12 months and have now reported positive net income on a quarterly and cumulative trailing 4-quarter basis, four quarters in a row. Throughout the quarter, we continued to deploy capital pursuant to our comprehensive capital allocation plan, our 2020 vision. Increasing shareholder returns, strengthening our balance sheet and investing in accretive growth. During the quarter, we repaid $50 million of long-term indebtedness redeeming a portion of the senior secured notes due in 2024 at SPL. As a reminder, in July, we used the proceeds from our inaugural investment-grade offering at CQP to refinance and redeem $1.4 billion of the SPL 2024 notes. We plan to address the remaining balance of the SPL 2024 notes with cash on hand in 4Q and into the first half of next year, after which point, we will have addressed all maturities in the complex through early 2025 with currently no refinancing needs across our complex until then.  Since rolling out our revised capital allocation plan last year, we have received 14 distinct rating upgrades throughout our structure. A result of our operational track record and capital allocation plans to opportunistically delever and efficiently refinance in the short amount of time, which has not only strengthened our balance sheet for through-cycle resilience but has also positioned Cheniere for our next phase of growth. Most recently, S&P upgraded CCH to BBB in mid-October. And in August, Moody's upgraded CEI to Baa3 and CCH to Baa2, while Fitch upgraded SBL to BBB+. With the Moody's upgrade, our parent entity is now investment grade across all three agencies. A major milestone for Cheniere considering where it started financially on this LNG export journey over a decade ago. As we've previously discussed, now that we have achieved investment-grade ratings across our corporate structure we are targeting a 1:1 ratio of deleveraging and share buybacks on an aggregate basis through 2026. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock for approximately $357 million, which reinforces our intent for the catch-up of buybacks compared to the amount of capital deployed towards deleveraging going forward. We expect to continue to work towards achieving that 1:1 ratio over the next year as we continue to initially target buying back approximately 10% of our market cap over time. We expect to deploy the remaining just under $2.5 billion of the repurchase authorization ahead of the 3-year plan, but recognize there may be variability quarter-to-quarter as we aim to be opportunistic and are subject to the parameters of our 10b5-1 program. For the third quarter, we followed through earlier this week by announcing an increase of our quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.435 per common share or $1.74 annualized, which is consistent with our 2020 plan of growing our dividend by approximately 10% annually into the mid-2020s through the construction of Stage 3. We intend to steadily increase our payout ratio over time while maintaining financial flexibility with a balanced capital allocation plan and the ability to fund brownfield growth with internally generated cash flow.  And for the final pillar of our comprehensive capital allocation plan, disciplined growth. We funded approximately $312 million of CapEx at our Stage 3 project during the quarter, with cash on hand. We still have over $3 billion available on our CCH term loan that we plan to utilize beginning in the second half of 2024 as the project progresses and the total capital spent to date continues to grow. By primarily funding the 50% equity component of the project ahead of the drawing down on the construction loan, we have saved considerably on interest expense while retaining all of our liquidity flexibility for the coming years to complete funding of the full project by 2026. Turning now to Slide 13, where I'll provide additional detail around 2023 guidance and our open capacity for 2024. Today, we are reconfirming our full year 2023 guidance ranges of $83 billion to $8 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion in distributable cash flow. But as Jack noted, we are tracking to the high end of those ranges. The improved outlook is driven by portfolio optimization activities, primarily in gas procurement and vessel subchartering and, to a lesser extent, the timing of some expenses moving to 2024 and higher marketing margins on the minimal and the open capacity for CMI, we still had available to sales since the last call.  With respect to our EBITDA sensitivity for the remainder of the year, we now have an immaterial amount of unsold LNG remaining. So we're confident in our ability to deliver financial results at the high end of the ranges. As always, our results could be impacted by the timing of certain cargoes around year-end as well as incremental margin from further optimization, upstream and downstream of our facilities. Our distributable cash flow for 2023 could also be affected by any changes in the tax code under the IRA. However, the guidance provided today is based on the current IRA tax law guidance. in which we would not qualify for the minimum corporate tax of 15% this year. However, as noted previously, both of these dynamics would mainly affect timing and not materially impact our cumulative cash flow generation through the mid-2020s as we think about our overall capital allocation plan and our 2020 vision goals. Looking ahead to next year, 2024 will be our most contracted year-to-date as all of the contracts underpinning the initial nine train platform will have commenced as well as some bridging volumes for contracts tied to our growth. Additionally, our team continues to put away the few remaining uncontracted volumes, leaving us with approximately 50 TBtu unsold for the full year as of today's call or about 2% of our 2024 production capacity. The open volume is based upon a production forecast of approximately 45 million tons, which is similar to our production this year and takes into account planned maintenance activities for the year. With such minimal open exposure to the market, 2024 is expected to look to most like a 9 train run rate year as any we will have. with results that should largely reflect the economics of a long-term fixed fee, take-or-pay style cash flow business model. With that said, currently forecast that a $1 change in market margin would impact EBITDA by approximately $50 million for the full year, with market margins currently elevated through the next year compared to our run rate CMI assumption of $2.25 per MMBtu.  We should be able to still beat the midpoint of our 9 train run rate of $5.5 billion of EBITDA and before any further volatility in commodity prices. 2024 results are expected to come down from this year as our open capacity narrows until Stage 3 starts ramping up our operational capacity again in 2025. Thanks to our cash flow visibility, 2024 was always assumed to be a heavily contracted year and consistently baked into our financial plans, including in our 2020 vision to generate over $20 billion of available cash through 2026 provided back in September 2022. As Jack noted, given the progress made by the Bechtel and Cheniere teams on Stage 3, we remain optimistic and hope to be in commissioning with first LNG from Train 1 by the end of next year, which would provide additional LNG supply to the delicately balanced market Anatol discussed earlier and increased our operational LNG capacity again in 2025. However, as a reminder, commissioning volumes would not impact our revenues or EBITDA for the year and instead show up in our financials as a reduction in our capital costs.  With the meaningful progress achieved to date, we expect to invest between $1.5 billion to $2 billion of CapEx towards Stage 3 in 2024, consistent with this year as we still expect to fund another approximately $0.5 billion of equity into the project this quarter. While the last few years have proven Cheniere's ability to respond to market signals and optimize throughout our business, our conviction in our highly contracted business model rooted in longer duration fixed fee cash flows from creditworthy counterparties has only been reinforced as we look forward to internally funding further growth as well as even more meaningful shareholder returns that can be relied on over time. These dependable cash flows form the foundation of the $40 billion natural gas infrastructure platform we have developed over the last decade plus. We remain focused on maintaining reliable and safe operations to ensure we can continue delivering affordable LNG as well as meaningful long-term value to our stakeholders around the world for decades to come. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. First question, I just wanted to make sure I understood. This quarter, you had a pretty big variance in volume at Sabine and at the CTP level. Just wanted to confirm that, that was really just a maintenance taking the facility offline? Or is there anything else to flag over there?\nZach Davis: This is Zach, and I'd say there's not much to flag there. Basically, the major maintenance on Trains 1 and 2 at Sabine were in June. And with that, the ramp-up then begun. And it takes time to eventually deliver those volumes. So it reduced the amount of interest going into Q3. And then on top of that, it was a really warm summer. So with the ambient temperatures, we had a little less volume than you'd have or a bit cooler. So regular core still on track with our forecast.\nMichael Blum: Okay. Got it. That makes sense. And then on the Sabine Pass expansion, obviously, BioMath roughly, I don't know, 30% contracted on the total size of the project, but you're almost that contracted on the first train. So my question is, would you consider going ahead with FID on just one train of the capacity? Are you going to wait until you get some percentage of the total project before you FID the entire project.\nJack Fusco: No, I think -- Michael, this is Jack. And you're right, it would be old to FID in whatever fashion that made the most financial sense. And if it makes sense to build it in phases, do Train 7 first and then train 8 later, we're going to do it that way. So we're currently working through Bechtel not only on a fixed price for the entire project, but also on implementation and execution. And -- so that's the way we think about it also. But we're going to continue to do it the way we've done it in the past, which is we're going to commercialize the project. We're going to get a fixed price and we're going to work with Bechtel to make sure that there that were locked in with price schedule and budget.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ben Nolan with Stifle.\nBenjamin Nolan: I'll put both of my questions into one, if I could. Your -- effectively, with the new contracts, including the two that are here, you're assuming, I suppose, a certain level of economics and cost inflation. And I know, Zach, you and I have talked that you're not going to do something that's noneconomic, but inflation continues to go higher. I guess really my question is, some of these have bridging volumes. So how does the mechanism works such that if inflation goes up and you're already committed and are already in some degree, selling on volumes, how do you adjust for that if the costs end up coming in higher than what you thought it was going to?\nZach Davis: This is Zach. So I'd basically say anything that's firm, we're assuming is going to be part of the operations of the 9 trains plus Stage 3. So the economics work, we're making the margins that we want to make. And we're being covered for inflation in that, let's say, 15 to 20-plus percent range to the fixed fee over time, which is really attractive in covering what we variance over the last few years. In terms of the rest, those are speed to the FIDs of those projects. And we're just going to be disciplined. I think you've seen that in every FID that we've done. And if we can target that around, let's say, 7x CapEx to EBITDA, get to 10% unlevered returns and always hold it up to beating the returns just embedded in buying back more of the stock without the growth, we're going to do that. And with inflation and cost of capital going up, that should be embedded in the stock price to an extent. So we'll keep ourselves honest and make sure it's clearly accretive to Cheniere.\nBenjamin Nolan: That makes sense. And just maybe as a follow-up. In your conversations as far with Bechtel the expansions, are you starting to see some stability with respect to price any sort of early indications as to whether or not things are leveling off a bit?\nJack Fusco: Yes. This is Jack, Ben. And we are -- and I'm glad to say that some of the steel prices in cement and rebar and everything else, structural still have come back down off their highs. So I think it's all moving in the right direction. And I feel really good about the timing of the project, and we have time to wait to see how this all works out before we lock in.\nOperator: Moving next to Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Question maybe somewhat more operational or construction development in nature here. But just Curious, if we look back, I guess, in the history of LNG development, both domestically and internationally, there's been just a long list of projects that have been delayed and not come out on time yet Cheniere is not just hitting the time lines of bringing them forward early. Just wondering specifically, if you could help us understand how Cheniere is able to bring these facilities online earlier than expected? And I guess, is there room for more?\nJack Fusco: Yes. So Jeremy, I mean, that's where our relationship with Bechtel has really paid off. And when we talk about the One Team approach between Cheniere and Bechtel really mean it. we do everything together. We walk the site together. We try to execute on different construction plans to see which one will work better for us, be more efficient, more effective. It really is a win-win between the two companies. And I can't say enough about how appreciative I am of Bechtel for working so collaboratively with us over these -- at least for me, close to the last 8 years. So it's no more or less than that.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just kind of pivoting towards capital allocation a little bit here. Zach, if I could. Just wondering current thoughts here, I guess, on the pace of buybacks as you see it as it relates to debt paydown and also financing the Corpus expansion, latest thoughts on how you see that all balancing. It looks like on the balance sheet, there is a mountain of cash that's pretty high. So just wondering what your current thoughts are?\nZach Davis: Hey Jeremy, I was expecting that question from you. But basically, yes, we have over $3 billion of cash sitting at CEI specifically. And you should assume over time as we fund Corpus and there's still about $1.2 billion of equity funding to go on stage 3, and obviously, pick up on the buyback, that will trend to $1 billion in a run rate phase once we get really through Stage 3. And in terms of the buyback, you just look at the last 2 quarters and you're starting to see that the buyback deployment is higher than the debt pay down. Just in Q3, it was $300 million higher, 7x as much. And at this point, buybacks for the year are about to eclipse the amount of debt pay down we did mainly earlier this year to get to IG and for everyone to just be tracking the buyback, it will be lumpy, volatile quarter-to-quarter as we try to be opportunistic. But what you can track it to is basically, we have already deployed over $3.5 billion to debt pay down in the updated capital allocation plan and just over $1.5 billion of buybacks so far in the same plan.  So there's basically a $2 billion plus catch-up trade that needs to occur really through 2024. So you can imagine we're pretty focused at CEI on funding the Corpus Stage 3 growth as it accelerates and to catch up on the buybacks with that, yes, at least $2 billion to go in the next year or so. In the meantime, we'll focus on Sabine growth, getting ready with all this commercialization that we've done by likely ramping down the variable DPU next year to start being in a position to fund that project once we can FID that in the next few years. And in terms of the Stage 3 expansion upon that for Train 8 and 9 we might fund that debt. There's going to be plenty of equity up there as well with the $20-plus billion of available cash through $26 million.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Very helpful. That makes sense. And also looking forward to Corpus coming online early some extra marketing margins there, helping out even more. So thank you for all the color, and we'll be talking later to see you at the conference.\nOperator: We'll go next to John Mackay with Goldman Sachs.\nJohn Mackay: Thank you for the time. why don't we pick up on the CQP variable distribution comments there, I figured that would be a fourth quarter call conversation, but thanks for kind of flagging that. Would just be curious on kind of where you think that needs to go at the CQP level? And then kind of more broadly, where do you want to see the kind of CQP-specific balance sheet go to, to be able to fund the SBL expansion if that moves forward?\nZach Davis: Sure. So we'll provide guidance for EBITDA and DCF for CEI on the Q4 call in February, and we'll provide guidance on the DPU for CQP at the same time as we work that through with our partners in Brookfield, Blackstone and the Board there. But basically, CEI is going to be focused on the growth and focused on the catch-up on the buyback in the billions. CQP is going to be focused on a robust distribution and really trending their debt-to-EBITDA metrics closer and closer to 4x or under. Basically, CEI is a consolidated entity and why it's investment grade is because we're already under 4x on a run rate basis with lower margins than today. CQP slightly above. So how we think about it is, basically, if we can retain some of that cash flow over the next couple of years, get the metrics down a bit lower, we're going to give ourselves a lot of flexibility financially to really re-up the leverage when we FID the Sabine expansion, keep at the very least, but probably more than the base distribution going and yes, keep the ratings and everything intact while growing that DPU over time to something closer to over $5. So yes, we're still pretty comprehensive across the board in terms of debt paydown, buybacks and growth. it's just going to be mixed between LNG and CQP.\nJohn Mackay: Right. I appreciate that. Maybe just picking up on one thing we haven't talked about I guess, more recently, just the CCUS potential for some of the expansions. Would just be curious to hear how much you're getting asked by your customer base to kind of include that? I know you've been able to sign a couple of different types of customers without necessarily moving forward on that. But would be curious kind of where broader sentiment sits there.\nJack Fusco: Yes. Thanks, John. I'll talk about the CCUS capabilities or what we've been doing at Sabine and Corpus. We've spent an enormous amount of time on engineering looking at ways to capture whatever carbon or greenhouse gases we can. We think the IRA bill going from $50 to $85 was a step in the right direction and we continue to look for opportunities to make our operations cleaner and more sustainable, which is a real focal point of myself and the team, and our customers, as you know, quite a few of them are from Western Europe and they're asking us as many questions as you are, and I'll turn it over to Anatol.\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Thanks, Jack. Thanks for the question, John. The customers that engage with us on this front, and obviously, it's a growing percentage. Jack mentioned some of the key European partners that are probably more advanced stages of developing these strategies is it a comprehensive approach, and we partner with them across a number of dimensions. Nothing is prescriptive, but one of the reasons we have these engagements and have the opportunity to proceed is because of all of the things that we are doing to improve our life cycle emissions profile. CCS is part of it as well as all of our programs with producers pipeline shipping companies that measure and ultimately report our emissions. We have the only program to date that issues cargo emissions with every cargo that we've had in place for a little over a year. All those are critical components to these engagements now that it is so prescriptive as to say we will work on X and we will deliver why.\nJack Fusco: And if you haven't already seen it, it's posted on our website, our CR report went live about 2 months ago.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jean Sadsbury with Bernstein.\nJean Salisbury: There's been some news articles recently highlighting that the Biden administration is moving extremely slowly on approving non-FTA LNG export permits. Could this become a gating issue for CC 8 and 9 FID? And is there any flexibility that you might have in your portfolio to FID, CC 8 and 9, even if you're waiting for that permit.\nJack Fusco: I don't think it's going to be a gating issue at all. We're already commercialized the repeat customers 8, 9 are backed by Chevron, Equinor, and Petro China. Yes. So I feel pretty good about where 8, 9 are. I'm also very optimistic. I mean, Chairman, Willie Phillips at FERC, he's been moving things along. I mean he's been acting in a bipartisan manner. We've seen good signs coming out of there recently. I'm hopeful that energy security now is on top of everybody's mind and our allies need more, not less from the U.S.\nZach Davis: And I'll just add, basically, we need to get going on construction of Train 8 and 9 at Corpus in 2026 as the first 7 trains complete. And our goal is definitely well ahead of that to get going. In the meantime, with the cash that we have, the flexibility we have in our revolvers and term loans long lead items opportunistically. We'll lock that in, in the coming year or so when possible. So yes, we don't see issues there. We have quite a bit of buffer just with trains 1 through 7 coming online in '25 and '26.\nJean Salisbury: Okay. Great. That's helpful. Sounds like the news reports are a little overstated. And then as a follow-up, my understanding is that most are all of the recent contracts that you signed that are linked to the Sabine Pass expansion can be kept even if you delay the expansion. Which would give you the option to be close to 100% contracted on your volumes exiting Pass expansion. Am I thinking about this correctly as sort of the base case for Cheniere here if you can't ultimately get to the numbers that you want for the Sabine Pass expansion ?\nAnatol Feygin: I guess we'll tag team this to some extent. But yes, you're absolutely right in the sense the contracts that we enter into give us tremendous flexibility on where they ultimately wind up and what projects they ultimately support. Now of course, for, we're very proud of the fact that unlike most projects to date, it does not have bridging volumes. It is linked initially to Sabine Train 8, our first contract that supports Train 8. But ultimately, we have full flexibility on where that contract ends up. So you're absolutely right in your assumption of kind of an extreme case that can be the decision to keep the contract if we so choose and not proceed for example.\nZach Davis: Yes, that's right. So basically, depending on the timing, yes, we might have to bridge some of these contracts with existing capacity, and we'll have that with our 55-plus million tons when Stage 3 comes online. And in these other scenarios that you just can't see when you're seeing out on the curve, still $5, $6 margins in a few years. Yes, we could be 100% contracted in a downside scenario. But that's not the plan. We're moving forward with the development of both of the sites. And we're going to try to stick to that 90%, give or take, contracted level.\nOperator: We'll go next to Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.\nKeith Stanley: On the 2024 volume, so I realize it's only 50 TBtu unsold and you're closer to the run rate EBITDA. Is there any way to think about or quantify if any material amount of next year's production was sold as bridging volumes for Stage 3 or shorter-term contracts that are more linked to what forward curves were at the time or should we think of it as 98% of productions effectively sold at long-term SPA type prices?\nZach Davis: I'd say almost, some of the numbers I'd give you is basically this year, we had over 40 million tons of long-term contracts. Next year, once we have full year of some of the contracts that started this year, some step-ups and even the start of a contract with PETRONAS will be over 43 million tons of long-term contracting. I will say with 50 TBtu open, the team has always been proactive. And they've already sold a few cargoes for next year in the -- on a short-term basis, but just a few, but in that $9 to $10 range that you can see on the curve today. So there's a little already embedded in there. And yes, we'll see where we are in February. We'll probably sold a bit more, but this is really our operational coverage to really fulfilling our obligations on 43-plus million tons of long-term contracts.\nKeith Stanley: That's helpful. Second one, just clarifications on Stage 3 with it running ahead of plan. So can you remind us commissioning cargoes are treated as a reduction in the capital cost, but if you get the substantial completion early, those excess volumes should drive higher EBITDA in 2025 and '26? And then relatedly, if we think about a 7 train project, should we expect if the first train comes on 3 to 6 months early, is that pretty even then for the rest of the trains as you see it coming on 3 to 6 months early? Or is it lumpy?\nZach Davis: Basically, yes. We'll give you updates as we keep on progressing on each. We have goals for each of the trains. First and foremost is getting Train 1 up and running. And hopefully, the rest are relatively cookie cutter to there, but it will take through '26 really to complete the state, the 7 trains and get them to substantial completion. And you're right, if we get into commissioning, you won't see like you won't see EBITDA in 2024 related to Stage 3. But at the rate we're going, next November's call for production in '25 and open capacity will be a lot more interesting than today.\nOperator: We'll go next to Craig Shere with TE Brothers.\nCraig Shere: So what -- how does it look in terms of further potentially upsizing legacy train capacity beyond 5 MTPA and could any concerted effort in that regard work concurrently with your efforts to contract out in FID, your SPL Stage 5 expansion?\nJack Fusco: Yes. So Craig, this is Jack. So the team is constantly looking at our debottlenecking and maintenance optimization program. So I have a lot of respected faith for this operating group and their ability to continue to surprise us. So it's my expectation that we will get technically get above 5 MTPA per train. But it may take some additional work before we get there. As far as how it connects to the SPL expansion, as Zach said, our focus is to get that commercialized to get those costs under control and locked in and meet our financial objectives and build those trains. So while we have a lot of optionality and flexibility, we are 100% focused on construction.\nZach Davis: And Craig, just for some numbers that we've talked about before is basically with Stage 3, we'll be a little over 55 million tons. And then with Train data, those are 3 million -- that's 3 million tons, but we'd hope just by adding those trains and some debottlenecking from Stage 3 and even maybe some from Train 1, 2, 3 there, we're going to get to 6 months. And then as we think about some of the efforts that we're doing and the development at Sabine, we're thinking of things like oil reliquefaction of the gas. So that could add incremental capacity as well. So we're pretty focused on the debottlenecking today. We're still at 5 million tons per train and we'll update you when we make more progress there.\nCraig Shere: And the second question, more for Anatol. Beforehand agreement seems comparatively more vanilla than your prior SPL Stage 5 offtake agreements or related agreements. Would you say that the market is starting to -- with higher interest rates, would worry about cost of capital and execution and large infrastructure projects the progress you've already made on scale Stage 5, your obvious historic execution and worries about peers are starting to make market off-takers look at saving expansion with greater value even without all the bells and whistles of DES or early cargoes and things like that.\nAnatol Feygin: Yes, Craig, I will not take offense to your comments on behalf of the origination team. But as we've said in the past, we do expect, as we move forward, that the contractual support will largely rhyme with what we've done in the past. It will be a mix of the complexity in these transactions is, as you guys know, Stage 5 and specially Train 8 is quite far out. So there's nothing that is as valuable in the market today as prompt volumes. You can see that obviously in the curve. And when we're talking about a contract that will start in most likely early next decade and continue for 20 years, there's complexity in that, right? So that is the -- that is the key issue there. But you're absolutely right on the second leg of your complement. As Jack said, 3,000-plus cargoes perfect delivery track record at a time when other facilities in the U.S. globally -- globally, the utilization rate for liquefaction is in the mid-80s. And of course, we don't even count the Libya and the Yemen's in those numbers, right? So our track record and the team's performance is a standout relative to our peers globally, and that is being reflected in our commercial engagements.\nOperator: We'll go next to Brian Reynolds with UBS.\nBrian Reynolds: I'll keep it to one question on that will be our Zach, thanks for the clarification on the follow-up on the 9-train run rate guidance and the commentary there. But Cheniere has made a lot of money on optimization on the portfolio, whether it's gas sourcing, regas or shipping. So just kind of curious if you can just update us if this is included in kind of the 9 train run rate guidance? And is there a way to kind of capitalize this number going forward, just given that it seems pretty ratable over the last 24 months? Or should we think about more cargoes going to Asia over the long term, maybe biting into some of that optimization.\nZach Davis: Sure. So basically, I mean, you can even look at like other revenue where the subchartering revenue comes in. And that goes all over the place quarter-to-quarter, just depending on the dynamics of how much length we have in our shipping portfolio to even sublease out. So these types of things they wouldn't be in our run rate numbers whatsoever. They're not even usually in our guidance until it's locked in because we just can't rely on it. It's another reason why we wait for guidance in February because there is a good amount of variability for in-transit between '23 and '24. Those are the types of things we don't want to count on with the guidance and somehow miss for just a timing reason. So that's why we'll come out with guidance in '24. And you could assume when we give you guidance, maybe on the high end, we're taking advantage of some of the optimization, not just in subchartering out our length on the shipping side and using third-party volumes to deliver some of our DES deals. But upstream of the sites as well. We've been really successful this year, taking advantage of basis differentials in lifting margin and yes, enhancing that lifting margin that we've made at both facilities. So not baked into run rate guidance, and we'll see where we are in February, but usually a tailwind to our guidance quarter-to-quarter.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. Makes sense. I'll leave it there. Thanks for the reminder on the CapEx to EBITDA swap for commissioning cargoes. Enjoy the rest of your morning.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the call back to management for additional or closing remarks.\nJack Fusco: I just want to thank everybody for their continued support of Cheniere and we'll talk soon.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Anatol Feygin",
            "content": "Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. While the LNG market kicked off the third quarter with prices reflecting the relatively subdued demand of the shoulder season, unprecedented early winter gas procurement in Europe, coupled with threats of potential supply disruptions globally, resulted in increased volatility and higher pricing throughout August and September. Prices remain elevated relative to pre '21 as the market is still precariously balanced, sensitive to any sign of disruption given the lack of spare supply capacity in the system, which is expected to continue for the next few years. The proposed strikes at the Australian LNG export facilities, representing approximately 10% of the global LNG market, garnering significant coverage during the quarter as the market tried to gauge the scale and length of any potential disruption to global flows. Fortunately, these risks were largely inverted and LNG exports continued to flow through the end of the quarter. Nevertheless, even the threat of disruption led to significant volatility in LNG prices, which was further exacerbated by the about 48% decline in Norwegian piped gas to Europe in September following extensive maintenance at the brownfield and the [indiscernible] gas processing plant. As a result, despite elevated storage inventories throughout the region, volatility persisted as TTF spot price has experienced some fairly significant swings throughout the quarter. The maintenance in Norway supported prices from early June, with July settling at $11.30 in MMBtu, while August settled over 25% lower at $830 an M, as Norwegian volumes returned only to rebound in September, which settled at $11.5 amid concerns around the Australian strikes as well as additional unplanned Norwegian maintenance. Still TTF prices remained at pre-Russian-Ukraine war levels during the quarter and continued to edge higher with futures settling October above $12 an M.  Meanwhile, JKM prices largely tracked TTF throughout the third quarter, ultimately settling September slightly below TTF at $11.20. However, more recently, JKM futures settled October higher at $13.30 due to the uncertainty around the potential industrial action in Australia as well as increased demand from China and India. Prices have since climbed further as indications of winter demand started to emerge towards the end of the quarter with JKM November trading around $14 to $15 an M. This is in stark contrast to Henry Hub prices, which averaged $2.55 an M during the quarter as inventories held above the 5-year average. These price levels continue to support the attractiveness of U.S. LNG globally. Unfortunately, threats of further disruptions in global gas markets remain ongoing, exposing key risks to an increasingly susceptible market that already lost 12 Bs a day of Russian last year. Furthermore, the recent lease at the Baltic Connector add to market apprehension highlighting the critical need for the development of sufficient capacity globally in order to meet elastic demand and ensure the security of supply globally for the long term. Let's address the regional dynamics on the next page. During the third quarter and for the first time in 2 years, Europe's LNG imports were lower year-over-year. Imports were near 7% or 1.8 million tons lower in the third quarter due largely to the same fundamental reasons we discussed previously, including high storage levels, reduced gas use across sectors due to price elasticity as well as conservation efforts, plus increased renewables generation. EU gas storage levels continue to grow nearing full as of early October, while lower economic activity put downward pressure on both industrial demand and electricity generation. Demand for gas fired power dropped by nearly 20% in Europe's key markets amid renewable power generation, which was 12% higher year-on-year. As a result, the reduced gas storage fill requirements coupled with the lower gas demand year-on-year, more than compensated for the further reduction in Russian pipe supply and the extended maintenance in Norway, allowing Asia to reenter the market and pull some additional LNG cargoes from the Atlantic Basin, as shown in the upper middle and right charts.  However, the cross base on price spreads throughout the quarter were not wide enough to drive meaningful volume away from Europe towards Asia. Total LNG imports in Asia grew over 4% or 2.7 million tons year-on-year in the third quarter, driven by a rebound in imports to China and India as prices softened and high summer temperatures boosted spot purchases. However, lower imports across the JKT market largely offset the significant gains seen in China and other emerging Asian markets, as shown in the lower left chart. In fact, imports into the key growth markets of China and India were 21% and 27% higher in Q3, respectively. In China, gas demand picked up during the quarter, primarily due to the year-on-year recovery in gas-fired power generation, following a drought that reduced hydro generation. Despite the higher demand, gas demand recovery in the industrial sector remains subdued, with consumption still below 2021 levels. Long-term fundamentals remain bullish for the Chinese market due to favorable policy targets and a massive gas infrastructure build-out as we described in previous calls. This year alone, China has added 9 million tons of regas capacity across three new terminals, bringing the total to 110 MTPA with another 95 MTPA under construction. Similarly, the country continues to expand its gas-fired power generation fleet with 46 gigawatts currently under construction on top of the existing 121 gigawatts. In India, it prolonged the heat wave and below average rainfall during the annual monsoon season increased the region's call in LNG. India reported 6 million tons in the third quarter. 1.3 million tons higher year-on-year as spot LNG prices moderated, incentivizing downstream gas use in the fertilizer and power sectors. Gas-fired generation was up 48% year-on-year in July and August, leading domestic players to issue tenders for cargoes to feed power demand. Furthermore, the new 6.5 MTPA Dhamra LNG terminal, the first in India East Coast ramped up to import 10 cargoes since starting commercial operations in May, ending to total imports in the quarter. The terminal which raised the country's regas capacity to 44 MTPA should enhance gas availability in Northeastern India, as connections to the grid improved, making gas more accessible to city gas distributors as well as refineries and fertilizer facilities. India's regas capacity is expected to reach 63 million tons, and that, along with the additional 11,000 kilometers of pipelines under development could make the country a top 3 LNG importer before 2040. In contrast, JKT imports dropped 11% or 3.7 million tons during the quarter, following previous declines and offsetting much of the gains in Asia. Year-to-date, JKT imports are 7.5 million tons lower versus last year, due largely to increased nuclear availability in Japan and Korea. Structural factor we have discussed previously. Japan's nuclear availability reached its highest level since the Fukushima disaster, and we expect this to present headwinds for gas power generation and LNG demand growth going forward. Accordingly, Japan's long-term gas demand is expected to decline gradually through 2040. Let's now elaborate on our updated expectations for long-term supply and demand on the next slide. As noted previously, the energy trilemma, especially with the market's heightened focus on long-term energy security has led to significant long-term LNG contracting in the past 18 or so months. These contracts signal the need for further investment in liquefaction capacity and serve to underpin some of the recent project FIDs.  As a result, we now see a significant amount of new capacity currently under construction. While this is expected to help reverse the systemic market tightening that has resulted from the curtailment of Russian volumes over the last 2 years, we believe that further LNG supply is needed to fully meet demand in 2028 and beyond which we expect to be fulfilled with some of the proposed pre-FID export projects, of course, including our own expansion plans at Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi. The concentration of FID is taking place this year next along with the start of delayed projects in East and West Africa, should help make LNG more accessible to price-sensitive markets while also making the industry more resilient in the fact base of supply disruptions or major geopolitical upsets, such as those threatening the market balances today. And just as liquefaction development has been active this year, the same is true for the regas side of the business.  Market players continue to develop import capacity across Europe and Asia which in total is expected to increase by 50% by 2030. We continue to forecast healthy demand for LNG over the coming decades with Europe sustaining its growth through the midterm and Asia driving future growth over the long term. As we've discussed before, we expect South and Southeast Asia as well as China to drive future demand growth as LNG plays a critical role in the economic prosperity, energy availability and decarbonization efforts in these regions. Overall, we estimate that by 2040, more than 130 MTPA of additional supplies needed beyond what is under construction today, which is due in part to the decline in production from legacy projects where feedstock availability and upstream developments appear limited going forward. For all these reasons, we believe overall market conditions remain constructive for Gulf Coast LNG and at Cheniere, we remain resolute in building on the commercial successes of recent years to support our capacity growth.  In 2023 alone, we have signed almost 6 million tonnes per annum with customers across Europe and Asia including today's announcement of our second 20-year SBA with Foran. This contract could very well extend into the second half of this century. Further evidencing our customers and the market's conviction in the long-term role of natural gas in the global energy mix and the need for further development of LNG capacity globally. With that, I'll turn the call over to Zach to review our financial results and guidance. Yes. Thanks, Jack. Thanks for the question, John. The customers that engage with us on this front, and obviously, it's a growing percentage. Jack mentioned some of the key European partners that are probably more advanced stages of developing these strategies is it a comprehensive approach, and we partner with them across a number of dimensions. Nothing is prescriptive, but one of the reasons we have these engagements and have the opportunity to proceed is because of all of the things that we are doing to improve our life cycle emissions profile. CCS is part of it as well as all of our programs with producers pipeline shipping companies that measure and ultimately report our emissions. We have the only program to date that issues cargo emissions with every cargo that we've had in place for a little over a year. All those are critical components to these engagements now that it is so prescriptive as to say we will work on X and we will deliver why. I guess we'll tag team this to some extent. But yes, you're absolutely right in the sense the contracts that we enter into give us tremendous flexibility on where they ultimately wind up and what projects they ultimately support. Now of course, for, we're very proud of the fact that unlike most projects to date, it does not have bridging volumes. It is linked initially to Sabine Train 8, our first contract that supports Train 8. But ultimately, we have full flexibility on where that contract ends up. So you're absolutely right in your assumption of kind of an extreme case that can be the decision to keep the contract if we so choose and not proceed for example. Yes, Craig, I will not take offense to your comments on behalf of the origination team. But as we've said in the past, we do expect, as we move forward, that the contractual support will largely rhyme with what we've done in the past. It will be a mix of the complexity in these transactions is, as you guys know, Stage 5 and specially Train 8 is quite far out. So there's nothing that is as valuable in the market today as prompt volumes. You can see that obviously in the curve. And when we're talking about a contract that will start in most likely early next decade and continue for 20 years, there's complexity in that, right? So that is the -- that is the key issue there.

            "name": "Jack Fusco",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today as we review our third quarter results and improved full year 2023 outlook. Before we get started, I would like to acknowledge the tragedies of war taking place around the world. Our thoughts and prayers are with those whose lives have been and continue to be impacted by these devastating and heartbreaking events. These events are contributing to disruptions, risk, uncertainty and volatility in the energy markets around the world. International gas supply sources and the critical infrastructure, enabling cross-border trade have become focal points with risk to this supply and its access increasingly reflected in price and volatility across international gas benchmarks in recent weeks. As the operator of the second largest LNG platform in the world, stable and reliable operations at our facilities have arguably never been more critical than it is today. As you all know, ensuring stable and reliable operations at our facilities with safety as a foundation has been my central focus since becoming CEO in 2016. When I joined Cheniere just begun LNG operations, producing its first LNG cargo that February. Today, we produce about two cargoes every single day. And during the third quarter, we produced our 3,000th cargo of LNG becoming the fastest LNG producer in history to achieve that milestone. I'm extremely proud of the work we do at Cheniere as a result of that work are providing tangible benefits in the lives of millions of people around the world. Our customers can take comfort knowing that my focus and the focus of my approximately 1,600 Cheniere colleagues remains on maintaining best-in-class operations to help ensure energy security for our 30-plus customers throughout five continents. Turn now to Slide 5, where I'll review key operational and financial highlights from the third quarter 2023, as well as cover another long-term SBA we announced this morning. We achieved successes across the Cheniere platform during the third quarter, generating consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.7 billion, distributable cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion and net income of approximately $1.7 billion. We exported a total of 152 cargoes, an increase relative to the second quarter as we had lower maintenance in the third quarter. As I just mentioned, we also produced our 3,000th cargo during the quarter and maintained our perfect track record of foundation customer cargo deliveries. These operational milestones are a tremendous source of pride for Cheniere and serve to further distance our reputation from the competition. Looking ahead to the balance of 2023, our forecast has improved slightly. And while we aren't raising our full year guidance to date, we are currently tracking to the high end of the $8.3 billion to $8.8 billion of consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion of DCF ranges. The improvement to our outlook is mainly driven by portfolio optimization activities the timing of some expenses to a lesser extent, from higher marketing margins than previously forecasted. Zach will provide more color on the guidance, but we have excellent visibility into the balance for the year and are confident in our ability to finish the year at the high end of the ranges. On the commercial front, Anatol and his team continue to build momentum for the SPL expansion project as we signed a long-term contract with BASF in August, early volumes under the offtake agreement will begin in 2026, ramping to the full 0.8 million tons with commercial start of the first train 7 of the SPL expansion project and extending until 2043.  This contract illustrates the rapid evolution of LNG into Europe as it's a long-term contract executed directly with an industrial consumer in Germany, which only a year ago, didn't have a single LNG import terminal. And I hope you saw earlier this morning, we announced our second 20-year agreement with Foran, building upon the SBA we executed with it in late 2021, that commenced earlier this year. Of the almost 6 million tons of long-term offtake executed year-to-date, over 75% of that annual total is contracted with repeat customers who clearly value their long-term partnership with Cheniere. Testament to the reputation and trust we have earned with our long-term customers. This foreign contract is for approximately 0.9 million tons will extend until 2050 and notably marks the first SBA tied to the second train of the SPL expansion, Train 8 as commercialization on the first train has effectively been completed. We are extremely excited about the market's response to the SPL expansion project and demand for additional capacity from Cheniere. Since announcing the project in February, we have signed nearly 6 million tons per annum of long-term contracts in support of the project and our best-in-class long-term contracted portfolio, all with investment-grade counterparties, and I'm confident we have more to do this year. As always, we remain laser focused on developing that project to meet or exceed our disciplined capital investment parameters in order to deliver the world-class contracted infrastructure returns that our shareholders are accustomed to. While on the topic of return, Zach and his team continued to progress on our comprehensive 2020 vision capital allocation plan. During the third quarter, we paid down another $50 million of long-term debt. We bought back approximately 2.2 million shares for $357 million and we increased our quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.435 for the third quarter. On Stage 3, we continue to equity fund that project, investing over $300 million during the quarter with a total of over $2.5 billion invested to date. Speaking of Stage 3, now turn to Slide 6, where I'm pleased to provide an update on the accelerated progress we are seeing. Since activities on the project moved more heavily into the construction phase a few quarters ago, we've indicated that certain of these construction activities were taking place ahead of plan as we are now over 44% complete overall across engineering, procurement and construction. While we remain in single digits in terms of percentage completion of construction for the overall project, it's becoming increasingly clear that the project is tracking month ahead of the guaranteed schedule. I'm optimistic we'll be commissioning on Train 1 with first LNG production by the end of 2024 and forecast all 7 trains to achieve substantial completion by the end of 2026. We are extremely excited about the progress Spectra was making on State Street, we look forward to maintaining our accelerating progress in order to again deliver LNG to the market, well ahead of schedule, increasing our operating capacity again starting in 2025. On the earnings call in August, I mentioned Stage 3 was beginning to take shape, as the first structural still was erected in our Train 1 coal boxes that arrived on site. One can certainly appreciate the progress that's been made since then from the photos on this slide. All Train 1 coal boxes have been set in place structural steel installation is advancing and piping and electrical installation has commenced.  With the excellent progress made to date, head count of over 1,500 personnel on site each day, and the One Team culture firmly established between Cheniere and Bechtel. I'm confident in the team's ability to maintain focus continue on the accelerated schedule to deliver Corpus Christi Stage 3 safely and ahead of schedule. With that, I'll hand it over to Anatol to discuss the LNG market. Thank you again for your continued support of Cheniere. No, I think -- Michael, this is Jack. And you're right, it would be old to FID in whatever fashion that made the most financial sense. And if it makes sense to build it in phases, do Train 7 first and then train 8 later, we're going to do it that way. So we're currently working through Bechtel not only on a fixed price for the entire project, but also on implementation and execution. And -- so that's the way we think about it also. But we're going to continue to do it the way we've done it in the past, which is we're going to commercialize the project. We're going to get a fixed price and we're going to work with Bechtel to make sure that there that were locked in with price schedule and budget. Yes. This is Jack, Ben. And we are -- and I'm glad to say that some of the steel prices in cement and rebar and everything else, structural still have come back down off their highs. So I think it's all moving in the right direction. And I feel really good about the timing of the project, and we have time to wait to see how this all works out before we lock in. Yes. So Jeremy, I mean, that's where our relationship with Bechtel has really paid off. And when we talk about the One Team approach between Cheniere and Bechtel really mean it. we do everything together. We walk the site together. We try to execute on different construction plans to see which one will work better for us, be more efficient, more effective. It really is a win-win between the two companies. And I can't say enough about how appreciative I am of Bechtel for working so collaboratively with us over these -- at least for me, close to the last 8 years. So it's no more or less than that. Yes. Thanks, John. I'll talk about the CCUS capabilities or what we've been doing at Sabine and Corpus. We've spent an enormous amount of time on engineering looking at ways to capture whatever carbon or greenhouse gases we can. We think the IRA bill going from $50 to $85 was a step in the right direction and we continue to look for opportunities to make our operations cleaner and more sustainable, which is a real focal point of myself and the team, and our customers, as you know, quite a few of them are from Western Europe and they're asking us as many questions as you are, and I'll turn it over to Anatol. And if you haven't already seen it, it's posted on our website, our CR report went live about 2 months ago. I don't think it's going to be a gating issue at all. We're already commercialized the repeat customers 8, 9 are backed by Chevron, Equinor, and Petro China. Yes. So I feel pretty good about where 8, 9 are. I'm also very optimistic. I mean, Chairman, Willie Phillips at FERC, he's been moving things along. I mean he's been acting in a bipartisan manner. We've seen good signs coming out of there recently. I'm hopeful that energy security now is on top of everybody's mind and our allies need more, not less from the U.S. Yes. So Craig, this is Jack. So the team is constantly looking at our debottlenecking and maintenance optimization program. So I have a lot of respected faith for this operating group and their ability to continue to surprise us. So it's my expectation that we will get technically get above 5 MTPA per train. But it may take some additional work before we get there. As far as how it connects to the SPL expansion, as Zach said, our focus is to get that commercialized to get those costs under control and locked in and meet our financial objectives and build those trains. So while we have a lot of optionality and flexibility, we are 100% focused on construction. I just want to thank everybody for their continued support of Cheniere and we'll talk soon."

I'm pleased to be here today to review our third quarter 2023 results and key financial accomplishments, which are the result of our team's commitment to operational excellence and financial discipline, the long-term outlook as we continue to deliver upon our stated objectives of supplying the world with much needed LNG, while creating long-term value for our stakeholders. Turn to Slide 12. For the third quarter, we generated net income of approximately $1.7 billion, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.7 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion. Our third quarter results continue to reflect a higher proportion of our LNG being sold under long-term contracts with less volumes being sold into short-term markets as well as the further moderation of international gas prices relative to last year.  Once again, these impacts were partially offset by certain portfolio optimization activities, upstream and downstream of our facilities. During the third quarter, we recognized an income 555 TBtu of physical LNG, including 545 TBtu from our projects and 10 TBtu sourced from third parties. Approximately 89% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SPA or IPM agreements with initial terms greater than 10 years. As a reminder, our reported net income is impacted by the unrealized noncash derivative impacts to our revenue and cost of sales line items, which are primarily related to the mismatch of accounting methodology for the purchase of natural gas and the corresponding sale of LNG under our long-term IPM agreements. The decline in international gas price curves quarter-over-quarter led to a lower mark-to-market valuation of the future liabilities associated with these agreements, increasing our net income.  With today's results, we have earned cumulative net income of approximately $12.4 billion for the trailing 12 months and have now reported positive net income on a quarterly and cumulative trailing 4-quarter basis, four quarters in a row. Throughout the quarter, we continued to deploy capital pursuant to our comprehensive capital allocation plan, our 2020 vision. Increasing shareholder returns, strengthening our balance sheet and investing in accretive growth. During the quarter, we repaid $50 million of long-term indebtedness redeeming a portion of the senior secured notes due in 2024 at SPL. As a reminder, in July, we used the proceeds from our inaugural investment-grade offering at CQP to refinance and redeem $1.4 billion of the SPL 2024 notes. We plan to address the remaining balance of the SPL 2024 notes with cash on hand in 4Q and into the first half of next year, after which point, we will have addressed all maturities in the complex through early 2025 with currently no refinancing needs across our complex until then.  Since rolling out our revised capital allocation plan last year, we have received 14 distinct rating upgrades throughout our structure. A result of our operational track record and capital allocation plans to opportunistically delever and efficiently refinance in the short amount of time, which has not only strengthened our balance sheet for through-cycle resilience but has also positioned Cheniere for our next phase of growth. Most recently, S&P upgraded CCH to BBB in mid-October. And in August, Moody's upgraded CEI to Baa3 and CCH to Baa2, while Fitch upgraded SBL to BBB+. With the Moody's upgrade, our parent entity is now investment grade across all three agencies. A major milestone for Cheniere considering where it started financially on this LNG export journey over a decade ago. As we've previously discussed, now that we have achieved investment-grade ratings across our corporate structure we are targeting a 1:1 ratio of deleveraging and share buybacks on an aggregate basis through 2026. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock for approximately $357 million, which reinforces our intent for the catch-up of buybacks compared to the amount of capital deployed towards deleveraging going forward. We expect to continue to work towards achieving that 1:1 ratio over the next year as we continue to initially target buying back approximately 10% of our market cap over time. We expect to deploy the remaining just under $2.5 billion of the repurchase authorization ahead of the 3-year plan, but recognize there may be variability quarter-to-quarter as we aim to be opportunistic and are subject to the parameters of our 10b5-1 program. For the third quarter, we followed through earlier this week by announcing an increase of our quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.435 per common share or $1.74 annualized, which is consistent with our 2020 plan of growing our dividend by approximately 10% annually into the mid-2020s through the construction of Stage 3. We intend to steadily increase our payout ratio over time while maintaining financial flexibility with a balanced capital allocation plan and the ability to fund brownfield growth with internally generated cash flow.  And for the final pillar of our comprehensive capital allocation plan, disciplined growth. We funded approximately $312 million of CapEx at our Stage 3 project during the quarter, with cash on hand. We still have over $3 billion available on our CCH term loan that we plan to utilize beginning in the second half of 2024 as the project progresses and the total capital spent to date continues to grow. By primarily funding the 50% equity component of the project ahead of the drawing down on the construction loan, we have saved considerably on interest expense while retaining all of our liquidity flexibility for the coming years to complete funding of the full project by 2026. Turning now to Slide 13, where I'll provide additional detail around 2023 guidance and our open capacity for 2024. Today, we are reconfirming our full year 2023 guidance ranges of $83 billion to $8 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion in distributable cash flow. But as Jack noted, we are tracking to the high end of those ranges. The improved outlook is driven by portfolio optimization activities, primarily in gas procurement and vessel subchartering and, to a lesser extent, the timing of some expenses moving to 2024 and higher marketing margins on the minimal and the open capacity for CMI, we still had available to sales since the last call.  With respect to our EBITDA sensitivity for the remainder of the year, we now have an immaterial amount of unsold LNG remaining. So we're confident in our ability to deliver financial results at the high end of the ranges. As always, our results could be impacted by the timing of certain cargoes around year-end as well as incremental margin from further optimization, upstream and downstream of our facilities. Our distributable cash flow for 2023 could also be affected by any changes in the tax code under the IRA. However, the guidance provided today is based on the current IRA tax law guidance. in which we would not qualify for the minimum corporate tax of 15% this year. However, as noted previously, both of these dynamics would mainly affect timing and not materially impact our cumulative cash flow generation through the mid-2020s as we think about our overall capital allocation plan and our 2020 vision goals. Looking ahead to next year, 2024 will be our most contracted year-to-date as all of the contracts underpinning the initial nine train platform will have commenced as well as some bridging volumes for contracts tied to our growth. Additionally, our team continues to put away the few remaining uncontracted volumes, leaving us with approximately 50 TBtu unsold for the full year as of today's call or about 2% of our 2024 production capacity. The open volume is based upon a production forecast of approximately 45 million tons, which is similar to our production this year and takes into account planned maintenance activities for the year. With such minimal open exposure to the market, 2024 is expected to look to most like a 9 train run rate year as any we will have. with results that should largely reflect the economics of a long-term fixed fee, take-or-pay style cash flow business model. With that said, currently forecast that a $1 change in market margin would impact EBITDA by approximately $50 million for the full year, with market margins currently elevated through the next year compared to our run rate CMI assumption of $2.25 per MMBtu.  We should be able to still beat the midpoint of our 9 train run rate of $5.5 billion of EBITDA and before any further volatility in commodity prices. 2024 results are expected to come down from this year as our open capacity narrows until Stage 3 starts ramping up our operational capacity again in 2025. Thanks to our cash flow visibility, 2024 was always assumed to be a heavily contracted year and consistently baked into our financial plans, including in our 2020 vision to generate over $20 billion of available cash through 2026 provided back in September 2022. As Jack noted, given the progress made by the Bechtel and Cheniere teams on Stage 3, we remain optimistic and hope to be in commissioning with first LNG from Train 1 by the end of next year, which would provide additional LNG supply to the delicately balanced market Anatol discussed earlier and increased our operational LNG capacity again in 2025. However, as a reminder, commissioning volumes would not impact our revenues or EBITDA for the year and instead show up in our financials as a reduction in our capital costs.  With the meaningful progress achieved to date, we expect to invest between $1.5 billion to $2 billion of CapEx towards Stage 3 in 2024, consistent with this year as we still expect to fund another approximately $0.5 billion of equity into the project this quarter. While the last few years have proven Cheniere's ability to respond to market signals and optimize throughout our business, our conviction in our highly contracted business model rooted in longer duration fixed fee cash flows from creditworthy counterparties has only been reinforced as we look forward to internally funding further growth as well as even more meaningful shareholder returns that can be relied on over time. These dependable cash flows form the foundation of the $40 billion natural gas infrastructure platform we have developed over the last decade plus. We remain focused on maintaining reliable and safe operations to ensure we can continue delivering affordable LNG as well as meaningful long-term value to our stakeholders around the world for decades to come. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line to questions. This is Zach, and I'd say there's not much to flag there. Basically, the major maintenance on Trains 1 and 2 at Sabine were in June. And with that, the ramp-up then begun. And it takes time to eventually deliver those volumes. So it reduced the amount of interest going into Q3. And then on top of that, it was a really warm summer. So with the ambient temperatures, we had a little less volume than you'd have or a bit cooler. So regular core still on track with our forecast. This is Zach. So I'd basically say anything that's firm, we're assuming is going to be part of the operations of the 9 trains plus Stage 3. So the economics work, we're making the margins that we want to make. And we're being covered for inflation in that, let's say, 15 to 20-plus percent range to the fixed fee over time, which is really attractive in covering what we variance over the last few years. In terms of the rest, those are speed to the FIDs of those projects. And we're just going to be disciplined. I think you've seen that in every FID that we've done. And if we can target that around, let's say, 7x CapEx to EBITDA, get to 10% unlevered returns and always hold it up to beating the returns just embedded in buying back more of the stock without the growth, we're going to do that. And with inflation and cost of capital going up, that should be embedded in the stock price to an extent. So we'll keep ourselves honest and make sure it's clearly accretive to Cheniere. Hey Jeremy, I was expecting that question from you. But basically, yes, we have over $3 billion of cash sitting at CEI specifically. And you should assume over time as we fund Corpus and there's still about $1.2 billion of equity funding to go on stage 3, and obviously, pick up on the buyback, that will trend to $1 billion in a run rate phase once we get really through Stage 3. And in terms of the buyback, you just look at the last 2 quarters and you're starting to see that the buyback deployment is higher than the debt pay down. Just in Q3, it was $300 million higher, 7x as much. And at this point, buybacks for the year are about to eclipse the amount of debt pay down we did mainly earlier this year to get to IG and for everyone to just be tracking the buyback, it will be lumpy, volatile quarter-to-quarter as we try to be opportunistic. But what you can track it to is basically, we have already deployed over $3.5 billion to debt pay down in the updated capital allocation plan and just over $1.5 billion of buybacks so far in the same plan.  So there's basically a $2 billion plus catch-up trade that needs to occur really through 2024. So you can imagine we're pretty focused at CEI on funding the Corpus Stage 3 growth as it accelerates and to catch up on the buybacks with that, yes, at least $2 billion to go in the next year or so. In the meantime, we'll focus on Sabine growth, getting ready with all this commercialization that we've done by likely ramping down the variable DPU next year to start being in a position to fund that project once we can FID that in the next few years. And in terms of the Stage 3 expansion upon that for Train 8 and 9 we might fund that debt. There's going to be plenty of equity up there as well with the $20-plus billion of available cash through $26 million. Sure. So we'll provide guidance for EBITDA and DCF for CEI on the Q4 call in February, and we'll provide guidance on the DPU for CQP at the same time as we work that through with our partners in Brookfield, Blackstone and the Board there. But basically, CEI is going to be focused on the growth and focused on the catch-up on the buyback in the billions. CQP is going to be focused on a robust distribution and really trending their debt-to-EBITDA metrics closer and closer to 4x or under. Basically, CEI is a consolidated entity and why it's investment grade is because we're already under 4x on a run rate basis with lower margins than today. CQP slightly above. So how we think about it is, basically, if we can retain some of that cash flow over the next couple of years, get the metrics down a bit lower, we're going to give ourselves a lot of flexibility financially to really re-up the leverage when we FID the Sabine expansion, keep at the very least, but probably more than the base distribution going and yes, keep the ratings and everything intact while growing that DPU over time to something closer to over $5. So yes, we're still pretty comprehensive across the board in terms of debt paydown, buybacks and growth. it's just going to be mixed between LNG and CQP. And I'll just add, basically, we need to get going on construction of Train 8 and 9 at Corpus in 2026 as the first 7 trains complete. And our goal is definitely well ahead of that to get going. In the meantime, with the cash that we have, the flexibility we have in our revolvers and term loans long lead items opportunistically. We'll lock that in, in the coming year or so when possible. So yes, we don't see issues there. We have quite a bit of buffer just with trains 1 through 7 coming online in '25 and '26. Yes, that's right. So basically, depending on the timing, yes, we might have to bridge some of these contracts with existing capacity, and we'll have that with our 55-plus million tons when Stage 3 comes online. And in these other scenarios that you just can't see when you're seeing out on the curve, still $5, $6 margins in a few years. Yes, we could be 100% contracted in a downside scenario. But that's not the plan. We're moving forward with the development of both of the sites. And we're going to try to stick to that 90%, give or take, contracted level. I'd say almost, some of the numbers I'd give you is basically this year, we had over 40 million tons of long-term contracts. Next year, once we have full year of some of the contracts that started this year, some step-ups and even the start of a contract with PETRONAS will be over 43 million tons of long-term contracting. I will say with 50 TBtu open, the team has always been proactive. And they've already sold a few cargoes for next year in the -- on a short-term basis, but just a few, but in that $9 to $10 range that you can see on the curve today. So there's a little already embedded in there. And yes, we'll see where we are in February. We'll probably sold a bit more, but this is really our operational coverage to really fulfilling our obligations on 43-plus million tons of long-term contracts. Basically, yes. We'll give you updates as we keep on progressing on each. We have goals for each of the trains. First and foremost is getting Train 1 up and running. And hopefully, the rest are relatively cookie cutter to there, but it will take through '26 really to complete the state, the 7 trains and get them to substantial completion. And you're right, if we get into commissioning, you won't see like you won't see EBITDA in 2024 related to Stage 3. But at the rate we're going, next November's call for production in '25 and open capacity will be a lot more interesting than today. And Craig, just for some numbers that we've talked about before is basically with Stage 3, we'll be a little over 55 million tons. And then with Train data, those are 3 million -- that's 3 million tons, but we'd hope just by adding those trains and some debottlenecking from Stage 3 and even maybe some from Train 1, 2, 3 there, we're going to get to 6 months. And then as we think about some of the efforts that we're doing and the development at Sabine, we're thinking of things like oil reliquefaction of the gas. So that could add incremental capacity as well. So we're pretty focused on the debottlenecking today. We're still at 5 million tons per train and we'll update you when we make more progress there. Sure. So basically, I mean, you can even look at like other revenue where the subchartering revenue comes in. And that goes all over the place quarter-to-quarter, just depending on the dynamics of how much length we have in our shipping portfolio to even sublease out. So these types of things they wouldn't be in our run rate numbers whatsoever. They're not even usually in our guidance until it's locked in because we just can't rely on it. It's another reason why we wait for guidance in February because there is a good amount of variability for in-transit between '23 and '24. Those are the types of things we don't want to count on with the guidance and somehow miss for just a timing reason. So that's why we'll come out with guidance in '24. And you could assume when we give you guidance, maybe on the high end, we're taking advantage of some of the optimization, not just in subchartering out our length on the shipping side and using third-party volumes to deliver some of our DES deals. But upstream of the sites as well. We've been really successful this year, taking advantage of basis differentials in lifting margin and yes, enhancing that lifting margin that we've made at both facilities. So not baked into run rate guidance, and we'll see where we are in February, but usually a tailwind to our guidance quarter-to-quarter."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Randy Bhatia. Please go ahead, sir.\nRandy Bhatia: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Cheniere\u2019s Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. The slide presentation and access to the webcast for today\u2019s call are available at cheniere.com. Joining me this morning are Jack Fusco, Cheniere\u2019s President and CEO; Anatol Feygin, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Zach Davis, Executive Vice President and CFO; and other members of Cheniere\u2019s senior management. Before we begin, I would like to remind all listeners that our remarks, including answers to your questions, may contain forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from what is described in these statements. Slide 2 of our presentation contains a discussion of those forward-looking statements and associated risks. In addition, we may include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the appendix to the slide presentation. As part of our discussion of Cheniere\u2019s results, today\u2019s call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP, or CQP. We do not intend to cover CQP\u2019s results separately from those of Cheniere Energy, Inc. The call agenda is shown on Slide 3. Jack will begin with operating and financial highlights. Anatol will then provide an update on the LNG market, and Zach will review our financial results and 2023 guidance. After prepared remarks, we will open the call to Q&A. I will now turn the call over to Jack Fusco, Cheniere\u2019s President and CEO.\nJack Fusco: Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today as we review our second quarter results and improved full-year 2023 outlook. Following a record-breaking year for the LNG industry, activity levels particularly in the U.S. remain elevated with significant commercial momentum and multiple projects having reached FID this year as energy consumers worldwide look to secure cost competitive, reliable natural gas supply in pursuit of achieving evolving energy, economic and environmental policies and goals. Such activity confirms liquefied natural gas as a preferred clean energy solution underscoring its critical long-term role in the global energy mix. Recently, the short-term global gas benchmarks have been volatile as markets try to adjust to a multitude of factors like weather, storage and economic growth that drive all commodity businesses. With over 150 million tons under construction globally and expected to come online over this decade, we expect pockets of volatility in the future as the market adjusts and absorbs this new supply. Cheniere is built to thrive in this volatility as a highly contracted nature of our cash flow profile ensures visibility in our returns, while maintaining some exposure to the upside when markets dislocate like they did last year. At Cheniere, our focus is centered on the long-term fundamentals for natural gas worldwide and today, those fundamentals remain as strong as ever, with the global LNG market expected to nearly double by 2040, hundreds of millions of tons of new LNG capacity will need to be developed to meet this demand and our platform is ideally set up to enable us to accretively capture our fair share. Please turn to Slide 5, where we will review key operational and financial highlights from the second quarter 2023 and introduce our upwardly revised full-year financial guidance. The second quarter was once again highlighted by excellent performance across the Cheniere platform. First and foremost, our relentless focus on operational excellence continues to set us apart and the successful completion of our planned maintenance at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi during the quarter further reinforces our execution capabilities and our stellar operating reputation that our long-term customers expect and appreciate. Also during the quarter, our commercial momentum on the SPL expansion project accelerated with three new long-term SPA in support of that project. And on project execution, Bechtel continues to progress Corpus Christi Stage-3 well ahead of schedule, increasing my optimism for that project being completed ahead of the guaranteed date. We have generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.9 billion in the second quarter, distributable cash flow of approximately $1.4 billion and net income of approximately $1.4 billion. These outstanding financial results are the product of our safe, stable and reliable operations at our facilities. Those operations resulted in the export of 149 cargoes in the second quarter, down from the record levels we have set in recent quarters due to the planned maintenance that was performed. And I will review the major turnaround at Sabine Pass in more detail in a minute. Looking ahead to the balance of 2023, our forecast has improved slightly. And today, we are raising our full-year guidance ranges by $100 million to $8.3 billion to $8.8 billion of consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion of DCF. The increase is mainly driven by the release of the remaining few cargoes that have been reserved for origination this year as well as some optimization and subchartering activity. Zach will provide more color on the guidance, but we have excellent visibility into the balance of the year, and we are confident in our ability to finish the year within these new ranges. During the second quarter, Zach and his team continued to progress on our comprehensive capital allocation plan. We paid down another $200-plus million of long-term debt. We bought back over two million shares for $337 million, and we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.395. In addition, we opportunistically refinanced our next debt maturity enabling further financial flexibility and doing so in a cost-efficient manner. On Stage-3, we continue to equity fund that project, investing approximately $200 million during the quarter and over $2 billion to-date. As I mentioned on the last earnings call, certain construction activities on Stage-3 are taking place ahead of plan, and I remain optimistic and schedule outperformance and potentially having more LNG volumes in 2025 and possibly the entire Seven Train project complete by the end of 2026. Stage-3 is over 38% complete, and the construction activities continue to ramp up as we now have nearly 1,000 personnel on site. In fact, during the second quarter, the first structural still was erected, an important milestone for Stage-3 as construction activities advanced and the project begins to take shape. Anatol and his team were also extremely busy in the second quarter as we signed 3 new long-term SPAs, which are expected to support the SPL expansion project. The SPAs are with Korea Southern Power and repeat customers Equinor and ENN and represent a mix of FOB and DES terms. The SPAs aggregates to just under four million tons per annum, each with a certain amount of volume tied to an FID of the First Train of the SPL expansion project. While it is early the diversity of this growing, creditworthy contract portfolio speaks to not only the strength and the long-term fundamentals of the LNG market, but also the value of the LNG marketplaces on Cheniere specifically. Turn now to Slide 6. You might recall last year, we sanctioned Corpus Christi Stage-3 with a diverse portfolio of FOB, DES and IPM contracts signed with customers from Asia to Europe to North America, featuring utility end users and portfolio players alike. Our customer portfolio is a result of continuous commercial innovation, in a customer-focused strategy that prioritizes collaboration and tailored energy solutions for our customers. We expect the contract portfolio on the SPL expansion project to reflect similar diversity and our early progress with KOSPO, Equinor and ENN, all investment-grade counterparties certainly support that. We are extremely excited about the commercial momentum we have gained on the SPL expansion project in such a short time, and I\u2019m optimistic there is more long-term business to do in support of the project this year. We look forward to continuing to build on the contract portfolio that features the breadth, depth and scale that sets us apart from the competition. Turn now to Slide 7. I will provide some details around the major maintenance turnaround we completed on Sabine Pass Trains 1 and 2 during the quarter. This was the largest maintenance turnaround we have completed yet at Cheniere. And first and foremost, I\u2019m proud to say the event was completed successfully on schedule and most importantly, with zero recordable or loss time injuries. The turnaround was successful, not only in terms of the important maintenance work executed under Trains 1 and 2, but also as it provides a foundation and some significant lessons learned as we conduct planning for future large-scale maintenance turnarounds. During the month of June, Trains 1 and 2 at SPL were offline for about 25 days. In approximately a 25-day span, we had an incremental approximate 1,400 personnel on site at Sabine Pass. Those personnel completed approximately 10,000 total tasks across 2,000 work orders with all of that work requiring over 2,250 permits to be issued. To have an effort like that completed in under four weeks, speaks to the enormous amount of planning and preparation ahead of time as well as an excellent execution and coordination throughout the event. I would like to recognize all those involved, especially our Cheniere personnel and our long-time equipment partners at Baker Hughes for delivering outstanding results and further reinforcing Cheniere\u2019s reputation for successful execution and demonstrating our safety-first culture from start to finish. The success of this major turnaround provides enormous benefits to Cheniere as well as our customers as we will use our experiences to inform maintenance planning in the future as well as with the goal of remaining a world-class operator in the eyes of the LNG industry, employees and stakeholders alike. Stable and reliable operations have never been more critical as energy security concerns have become a significant priority around the world, and our dependable operations continue to grow as a distinct competitive advantage. Last month at the LNG 2023 Industry Conference in Vancouver, energy security and reliable LNG operations were primary themes in the hallways and in the presentations on the main stage. I was proud to hear many of our long-term customers acknowledge and thank Cheniere specifically for being such a reliable and responsible LNG supplier. The value of that track record is clearly being demonstrated evidenced by not only the financial results and guidance we reported this morning, but also by the four million tons per annum of contracts we signed this quarter. We will continue to press this and our many other competitive advantages as we commercialize additional capacity on the Sabine Pass expansion project. On that note, I will hand it over to Anatol to further address the LNG market and our commercial strategy. Thank you all again for your continued support of Cheniere.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Throughout the second quarter, international gas benchmarks continue to moderate briefly returning to single-digit territory as global inventory levels reach historic highs amid mild weather and tepid macroeconomic activity in most of the key demand centers. Although the extreme prices and volatility of 2022 appear to be in the rearview mirror, prices remain above historical norms and the market continues to react to news of any potential disruption. TTF contract settled at $7.75 in MMBtu, the lowest monthly settlement since April of 2021, but it is higher more recently, selling July at $11.30 due to extended maintenance in Norway. Similarly, JKM delivery prices dropped from about $14 an MMBtu for April to settle around $9.60 for July and back up around $11.90 MMBTU for August thanks to cooling demand load, LNG outages and summer maintenance. In the U.S., mild weather and production growth kept Henry Hub prices below $3 during the quarter, incentivizing coal-to-gas switching, which, along with lower renewable generation and coal retirement have significantly increased power sector demand, helping balance the market. Strong summer cooling demand along with the return of LNG facilities for maintenance has provided milder support to prices with the August contracts settling just below $2.50. While concerns about near-term market tightness have moderated amid softer near-term fundamentals and continued uncertainty around the pace of China\u2019s recovery, we still view the market to be structurally tight and delicately balanced over the next few years as very limited new supply is set to enter the market globally, leaving further potential for upside risks going forward. With that in mind, let\u2019s now turn to Slide 9 to address regional dynamics in more detail, starting with Europe. During the second quarter, Europe\u2019s LNG imports continue to grow year-on-year despite ongoing efforts to reduce gas consumption. LNG flows to Europe grew 9% year-on-year or 2.7 million tons for the second quarter on the back of strong U.S. growth in April and May. June imports were relatively flat driving TTF prices near precrises levels before picking up again on news on an extended outage at Hammerfest LNG and other gas processing facilities. Reduced gas consumption coupled with elevated gas processing facilities. Reduced gas consumption coupled with elevated storage levels at the top of the five-year range, continue to weigh on the European market with data from the IEA suggesting the total European gas demand fell by more than 30 BCM in the first half of 2023. Total electricity generation has declined considerably, falling 9% in the first half of 2023 relative to historic averages, largely as a result of the Russian and Ukraine war and slower economic growth throughout the region. This decline, coupled with notable gains in renewable power generation, resulted in lower demand for thermal generation further contributing to the decline in total gas consumption. However, we started to see a deceleration of these trends in the second quarter as gas burn economics improve. Once overall energy demand levels are gradually restored in Europe, we expect natural gas to regain its share in the supply stack and maintain its critical role in Europe\u2019s power mix. Furthermore, the coal, lignite and nuclear base load capacity retirement is currently underway in Germany and other European countries should increase demand for gas capacity to maintain grid reliability and flexibility in the power supply stack amid increasing renewable capacity. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 10 to discuss Asia. While LNG demand across Asia has remained largely subdued year-to-date, increased imports in China, South and Southeast Asia during the quarter were offset by further demand decline in Japan with only 14 million tons of LNG imported by the country in the second quarter, representing an 18% decline year-on-year. In fact, May registered the lowest import levels in Japan in 15-years as consumers were incentivized to conserve energy amid electricity rate hikes. Additionally, nuclear availability impacted gas demand in the power sector. We expect this trend to continue as two additional nuclear reactors in Japan are scheduled to restart in the third quarter. Similarly, we expect to see nuclear pressures on LNG spot buying in Korea too where LNG imports were flat in Q2 with the start-up of the 1.4 gigawatt Shin Hanul 1 nuclear plant last year and the expected startup of the similarly sized Shin Hanul 2 in the third quarter of this year. In India, imports during the quarter trended slightly higher compared to last year, increasing by about 4% year-on-year. Despite the further decline in JKM, prices remained too elevated during the quarter to elicit a meaningful response from price-sensitive South Asian buyers. Southeast Asian demand showed significant growth during the quarter as imports increased 31% year-on-year. Thailand, the main driver of the region\u2019s demand grew imports 43% or one million tons in Q2 amid a heat wave that sent temperature soaring. Southeast Asia is expected to be an important growth market in the future as it expands its import infrastructure. The region added a new market in the second quarter as the Philippines imported its first cargo in April. And just last month, Vietnam started commissioning its first regas terminal to service a new 1.5 gigawatt gas-fired power plant. In China, LNG imports picked up in the second quarter, increasing 20% year-on-year. A warm and dry summer triggered a rebound in spot buying activity as a persistent heat wave and low hydropower generation output increased demand for natural gas. China\u2019s hydropower dropped 28% year-on-year in the first half of 2023, helping boost electricity demand from other sources, including gas. In fact, during the quarter, overall gas demand grew 10% year-on-year despite some macroeconomic headwinds in China. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 11 for some thoughts on the market for long-term contracting. Despite some of the near-term market dynamics discussed earlier, pointing to potentially softened demand for LNG in the front of the curve, which as Jack noted, we are largely insulated from, over the last 12-months to 18-months, we have witnessed record levels of long-term contracting, particularly for U.S. volumes as the long-term trade outlook continues to call for further growth in LNG supply. In aggregate, the level of long-term Henry Hub linked contract signed in 2022 alone far exceeded the total signed over the six preceding years combined and the market looks to be on track to potentially repeat this level of contract activity this year. As we previously discussed, we expect demand from China and other fast-growing Asian economies to underpin the next LNG supply wave, representing over 70% of the LNG demand growth through 2040. Asian demand, coupled with Europe\u2019s desire to replace Russian supply has driven recent commercial activity. Although Asian customers and portfolio players have been the largest and most active buyers of long-term volumes globally over the past 18-months, European counterparties have certainly stepped up, signing contracts representing over 20 MTPA of which 18 MTPA is tied to U.S. projects or about a quarter of the total U.S. volumes signed since 2022. At Cheniere, we have signed over 15 million tons of long-term contracts in just the last 18 months, 30% of which are expected to underpin our future growth at both Corpus and Sabine Pass. While mid-scale Trains 8 and 9 are fully commercialized, the origination team is hard at work constructing the portfolio for the SPL expansion project. As Jack mentioned, our success to date has been a direct result of our resolute commitment to operational excellence and financial discipline across everything that we do. Our contract portfolio today is comprised of a diverse mix of contract structures with varying terms and tenors, all of which were signed with high-quality, creditworthy and geographically diverse counterparties who value the flexibility and reliability of our products. In fact, several of our recently signed contracts were signed with repeat customers, ENN and Equinor most recently, but also EOG, ENGIE and Petro China last year, signaling the mutual commitment to quality we share with our long-term customers. As we continue to commercialize our growth projects, this commitment will remain steadfast. With that, I will turn the call over to Zach to review our financial results and guidance.\nZach Davis: Thanks, Anatol and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to be here today to review our second quarter 2023 results and key financial accomplishments, all of which are products of our team\u2019s dedication to operational excellence, seamless execution and financial discipline as we continue to serve our customers across the world while creating long-term value for our stakeholders. Turning to Slide 13. For the second quarter, we generated net income of approximately $1.4 billion, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.9 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $1.4 billion. Relative to recent quarters, our second quarter results reflect a higher proportion of our LNG being sold under long-term contracts, less volumes being sold into short-term markets, continued moderation of international gas prices as well as the operating cost and production impact from the major turnaround at SPL during the quarter. Once again, these impacts were partially offset by the proactive locking in of a large portion of our open cargoes for the quarter, late last year and earlier this year and margins above what is in the market today. During the second quarter, we recognized in income 561 TBtu of physical LNG, including 547 TBtu from our projects and 14 TBtu sourced from third parties. Approximately 85% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SPA or IPM agreements with initial terms greater than 10-years. As we have noted in prior earnings calls, our reported net income is impacted by the unrealized, non-cash derivative impacts to our revenue and cost of sales line items, which are primarily related to the mismatch of accounting methodology for the purchase of natural gas and the corresponding sale of LNG under our long-term IPM agreements. The further decline in sustained moderation and volatility of international gas price curves throughout the second quarter serve to benefit the mark-to-market valuation of these agreements, increasing our net income line item for the third quarter in a row. With today\u2019s results, we have earned cumulative net income of approximately $8.4 billion for the trailing 12-months and have now reported positive net income on a quarterly and cumulative trailing four quarter basis, three quarters in a row. Throughout the quarter, we continue to deploy capital pursuant to our comprehensive capital allocation plan, increasing shareholder returns, strengthening our balance sheet and pursuing accretive growth. In June, we refinanced and replaced our existing secured credit facilities at CQP and SPL with a new $1 billion senior unsecured facility at CQP and a $1 billion senior secured facility at SPL. These transactions extended the original maturities, migrated some capacity from the project to parent, desecured some of our borrowing capacity and further enhanced our liquidity with more flexible terms. These new facilities, combined with the CEI and CCH credit facilities, and our cash on hand, provide ample consolidated available liquidity, affording us even greater optionality as we continue to execute on our long-term capital allocation plan while effectively operating and constructing the second largest LNG platform in the world. During the quarter, we repaid a little over $200 million of long-term indebtedness through our open market repurchase program. Substantially all of which was used to repurchase a portion of the senior secured notes due in 2024 at SPL. In June, we further addressed these notes opportunistically with our inaugural investment-grade offering at the parent level, $1.4 billion of 5.95% senior unsecured notes at CQP. The net proceeds from this offering were used to further refinance and redeem approximately $1.4 billion of the SPL 2024 notes, not only extending our maturity but also desecuring and further desubordinating our balance sheet, all three of which are key tenets to the balance sheet strategy set forth in our capital allocation plan. As discussed on previous calls, we plan to address the remaining balance of the SPL 2024 notes with cash on hand later this year and into next, after which point, we will have addressed all maturities through early 2025. In the meantime, you can expect we will continue to opportunistically delever utilizing our open market repurchase program. On the ratings front, just last week, Fitch upgraded CCH to BBB from BBB-, bringing our project level ratings in line at Fitch. In April, Moody\u2019s announced that CEI and CCH were under review, which, if upgraded, would further solidify our corporate structure as investment grade. As noted on the last call, now that we have achieved investment-grade ratings across our corporate structure. Going forward, we are targeting a one-to-one ratio of deleveraging and share buybacks on an aggregate basis. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares of common stock for approximately $337 million. As we have previously noted, there will likely be a catch-up trade over the next year or two in order to achieve that one-to-one ratio, where our opportunistic repurchase plan will outpace debt repayment over that time. We are confident that we will deploy the remaining $2.8 billion of our share repurchase authorization to complete our $4 billion plan ahead of schedule, as our goal to repurchase approximately 10% of the company remains intact. We also declared our eighth quarterly dividend of $0.395 per common share for the second quarter last week. Later this year, we expect to be able to step up the dividend in line with our previous guidance of growing our dividend by approximately 10% annually into the mid-2020s through construction of Stage-3. And for the final pillar of our comprehensive capital allocation plan, disciplined growth, we funded approximately $200 million of CapEx at our Stage-3 project during the quarter with cash on hand as this remained the most efficient form of funding during the quarter. However, we will have over $3 billion available on our CCH term loan that we plan to utilize in the coming years. As Jack mentioned, the Bechtel and Cheniere teams have made meaningful progress year-to-date, so we are optimistic on the timing of those volumes and our ability to bring another over 10 million tons to market ahead of schedule. Turning now to Slide 14, where I will discuss our 2023 guidance and update you on our open capacity for the remainder of the year. Today, we are raising our full-year 2023 guidance ranges by $100 million to $8.3 billion to $8.8 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion in distributable cash flow. With respect to our EBITDA sensitivity for the remainder of the year, we have an immaterial amount of unsold LNG remaining. So we have excellent visibility of delivering results comfortably in these ranges for the year and in cargoes originally reserved for origination. Combined with the incremental margin from optimization activities, this gives us further clarity around our expected financial results for the year and supports the increase to our ranges today. As always, our results could be impacted by the timing of certain year-end cargoes heading into 2024 as well as incremental margin from further optimization of upstream and downstream of our facilities. Our distributable cash flow for 2023 could also be affected by any changes in the tax code under the IRA. However, the guidance provided today is based on the current IRA tax law guidance in which we would not qualify for the minimum corporate tax of 15% this year. However, as noted previously, both of these dynamics would mainly affect timing and not materially impact our cumulative cash flow generation through the mid-2020 as we think about our overall capital allocation plan and our 2020 Vision goals. Similar to this past year, we look forward to providing additional insight on our 2024 production profile and open capacity on our next call in November, with official 2024 financial guidance to come out with our Q4 and full-year 2023 results in February. As we have consistently forecasted, including in our 2020 vision, 2024 may end up being our most contracted year ever on a percentage basis, ahead of Stage-3 coming online in 2025 and 2026, which is expected to grow our operating LNG portfolio to over 55 million tons per annum. Despite some near-term challenges in the market like cost inflation, higher borrowing costs and competition, the global market is clearly calling for new LNG supplies given the many advantages of natural gas as a primary energy source. At Cheniere, we are well positioned and committed to providing energy solutions for our customers, developing and building projects that deliver appropriate risk-adjusted returns for our investors and stakeholders and operating and maintaining our facilities with the safety first culture in order to be the LNG provider of choice for decades to come. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Our first question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Just want to start off with the balance sheet, if I could. I think there was $4.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. So a mountain of cash there and just wondering how you think about deploying that. Clearly, there will be some debt paydown and some funding for expansions. But as far as return to capital, just wondering if you might be able to provide a bit more color there, just $4.5 billion being a sizable number.\nZach Davis: Thanks, Jeremy. This is Zach. So as you think about the $4.5 billion of unrestricted cash that had an increment -- in that was a $1.4 billion related to the bond proceeds from the CQP bond we did in late June. That was a refinancing that was executed in early July. So you have to take at least $1.4 billion out of that. And then when you think about how much is actually sitting at CEI versus CQP, it is in the mid-2s. So clearly, there is ample liquidity when you consider that our guidance of $6 billion of DCF or so, and we have made around $4 billion of that to date. So when you think about liquidity, we like to keep around $1 billion on the balance sheet at all times, give or take. We probably have around another $1 billion to spend on the Corpus Stage-3 project this year and then the dividend that were set to increase in Q3, like the guidance that we had last year. So you take all that into account, there is still probably a couple of billion dollars there. And I will just reiterate what we keep on saying is that we are intent to catch up on the one-to-one cumulative ratio between debt paydown and share buybacks over time. And we are on track to do so. So there will be, over time, billions of dollars allocated to our buyback program. We are just going to stick to our opportunistic approach, abide by 10b5-1 rules, and we will follow through and eventually get to that $20 per share of run rate cash flow.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That makes sense. A couple of billion dollars of cash, nice to have discretionary on the balance sheet there. Maybe pivoting a little bit and just see the guidance raised again there. Wondering if you might be able to provide a bit more color as far as the optimization opportunities, be upstream, downstream or at the facilities, what they are, how big they are, how sticky they are. Does any of this impact, I guess, run rate EBITDA as you think about it?\nZach Davis: So I guess the good thing on that is no, it doesn\u2019t affect run rate EBITDA because we really don\u2019t guide to it until it is firm. So as we think about run rate EBITDA over time that is just based on the fixed fees, the open capacity at 2.25 and a basic lifting margin. That is it. So these are the types of examples that are the incremental optionality that comes with like the Cheniere platform from our Brownfield growth to the opportunities upstream with lifting margin and being such a big customer to most of the pipes upstream of the plant and the biggest consumer of natural gas in the United States to being a relatively big charter with our DES and IPM deals. So basically, what happened in the quarter was we firmed up the more of the sub chartering, let\u2019s say, of some of our length on our shipping portfolio. And once that is firm, I see it in the guidance and that helps move the numbers upward. Add to that we released those four origination cargoes. Anatol and the team build another four million tons without meeting needing much in terms of bridging, and we were pretty much obligated to increase guidance by $100 million this quarter.\nOperator: We will go next to Jean Salisbury with Bernstein.\nJean Salisbury: Can you speak to what sort of cost inflation you are expecting for Corpus Christi eight and nine, assuming that you do it as you progress there?\nJack Fusco: Jean, I\u2019m not expecting much. We have been very effective with Bechtel on buying materials when we see low points. I think our overall inflationary environment has been around 10% so far from us being working closely and collaboratively with Bechtel on the procurement. So I would expect that to be the same for eight and nine also.\nJean Salisbury: Great. As a follow-up, Cove Point transacted recently at a much lower multiple than in 2019. Can you just kind of - is this a sign that the LNG space is becoming more challenged. How did you view that transaction multiple?\nJack Fusco: But it is hard to make that comparison, right, from a single train confined - I mean I have spent a lot of time down in that part of the woods. As you all know, I have a house in Annapolis and there is no growth potential to compare Cove Point to Cheniere is not even close to being correct. But you want to get through the share.\nZach Davis: Sure. I think there is more dynamics to this than just looking at the multiple. I think they sold to an existing operator, an existing owner and it is probably the easiest way for Dominion to get out of the business. But if you account for no growth to customers, polling versus our FOB, BS , IPM, CMI model, where you get all the steady cash flows, but also, like this quarter, incremental cash flow from all the optionality that comes with the platform. I think it only reaffirms that we are going to get a premium valuation to anything that Cove Point has or something like that. So that is how we think about it. And clearly, even at the share price today, we are barely getting valued at that type of multiple. And what we are pretty keen on is every turn on that multiple is probably over $25 to the share price. So we will take it. And yes, I just wouldn\u2019t say it is apples-to-apples.\nOperator: We will go next to Julien Dumoulin Smith with Bank of America.\nCameron Lochridge: This is actually Cameron Lochridge on for Julien. I wanted to start just on the expansion efforts, right, with Sabine, specifically asking kind of how you guys are thinking about open capacity for those trains. Would you give any consideration maybe to carrying in a little more open capacity than you have with some of your other projects. And then on a related note, just any update on the regulatory front, just given some of the recent decisions and whatnot by the DOE and elsewhere?\nJack Fusco: Cameron, this is Jack. I will start off. And the answer on the first one was exposure to the commodity markets. I would say no. We are going to do this the way we have done trains in the past. We are going to use our financial discipline. We are going to commercialize 85% to 90% of the output of the train that we feel comfortable that we can reliably serve and make sure it meets all of our financial criteria that Zach and the team have laid out many times in the past. . As you know, I have spent time in the power business, and that was almost a 100% merchant day in and day out. And I felt like a farmer, I was always worried about the weather. And we have no desire to invest billions of dollars - continue to invest billions of dollars in American infrastructure and pray that commodity markets will come back our way. So that is the first part. And then second question was on the regulatory structure or recent regulatory developments. I mean I, for one, I\u2019m guardedly optimistic. I think under Chairman Philips, FERC is trying to act a little more in a bipartisan way. They have approved some major natural gas projects and specifically some LNG projects to go - to move forward, and that is been very positive all the way around that things are actually being reviewed and approved in FERC. And then similarly, I would say at the DOE, Secretary, Granholm was very clear when she discussed the critical role of U.S. LNG to support our allies and testimony that you recently gave to the House of Representatives. So those to me are really positive developments on the regulatory front for our expansion opportunities.\nCameron Lochridge: Got it. And then maybe one for Anatol real quick. You mentioned European appetite for long-term contracts in your prepared remarks, just how strong that is been of late. Any insight you can share on what is - perhaps what is driving that and for how long you maybe see that persisting?\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Thanks, Simon. I do think that European sort of direct end users will continue to be part of the long-term sort of support equation for U.S. projects. My comments were kind of in the context of Europe not being as big a piece of the equation in 2022 as I would have expected and that has changed slightly, but it is still only a quarter. And the vast majority of that volume moving forward will still be addressed by intermediaries who are still half of that volume. So it has improved. I expect that to continue to be a healthy market for long-term commitments, but it will still be very much intermediated by portfolio players as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Reynolds with UBS.\nBrian Reynolds: We continue to see some exciting announcements around bringing more natural gas from Texas into the LNG, Louisiana corridor. So kind of just curious just given the size and scope of the Sabine Pass expansion, if there are any updated thoughts around providing equity support to bring natural gas into Texas and what that permitting time line could look like just given its crossing state borders and likely need for Greenfield capacity.\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Sure, Brian. As we have said in the past, we view the gas supply component of our projects as an absolutely critical step, and we would not pursue a project that did not have a robust gas supply solution. That said, we view the Permian as a great source, not just for Corpus and this expansion but also for the expansion of Sabine, and we will continue to work with our infrastructure partners to find the best options for supplying the Sabine expansion. So whether that includes equity or not, TBD, obviously, we are not opposed to that, as you saw with our project into the Corpus expansion. And all of those options are on the table.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. I appreciate all the color. And as my follow-up, Zach, I kind of want to talk about potential funding needs for the Sabine Pass expansion. Just given the attractive leverage and debt levels at CQP with the debt reduction over the past few years and the ability to flex that variable distribution when the time comes to spend capital on expansion. Just kind of curious around if you could provide some more color around funding expectations between debt and perhaps internal equity for the project.\nZach Davis: Sure. So it will be a debt and internal equity funding for that project over time. And we will start thinking about that now - we are thinking about the next few years as we are in development. what is the leverage metric should be going into FID. And honestly, the lower those leverage metrics are going into FID, more capacity we would have to lever up to help funding during construction of the project. So anything that we pay down going forward inside the CQP box is honestly like a pre-investment for that expansion. And as we look at our metrics on a consolidated basis, we are right under four times. CQP is a little over four times. So it will make sense for some of the debt paydown going forward to be inside that CQP box. And with that, it will give us even more funding flexibility when it comes to FID in a couple of years where we will live within cash flows, maintain a base distribution and most importantly, maintain those investment-grade credit metrics so that eventually that, let\u2019s say, high $3 DPU run rate can get to something like $5 or better.\nOperator: Our next question comes from [Sam] (Ph) Burwell with Jefferies.\nGeorge Burwell: I know that you have addressed it already, so I don\u2019t want to belabor it too much, but just the buyback seemed a little bit smaller, especially relative to the free cash flow that you put up in the quarter. So just curious if you could maybe elaborate or give a little bit more color on the 10b5 restrictions that are in place, just seeing as you repurchased a lot more stock in 4Q 2022 and 1Q 2023 relative to what you did in this past quarter despite - I mean, the shares being under pressure in May and June.\nZach Davis: Sure. I\u2019m going to go back to the fact that we are thinking about this in the 2020 vision through 2026, and we have a three-year plan for $4 billion. And on a cumulative basis, we will get there on a one-to-one debt pay down to share buyback and to focus quarter-by-quarter is honestly not how we are looking at it. But again, if you just look at the time you are referencing where the stock was probably like $20, $25 lower than where it is today, clearly, if there has been pressure for a continued period of time, we probably would have been able to buy more. But abiding by 10b5-1 rules, we are not ones that are allowed to affect the share price. We are not allowed to buy at the opening or at the end of the day, and there is a myriad of other rules that we have to be careful of that, yes, when there is only three-days of extreme pressure at a certain price level, we can\u2019t be a majority of it. . So I wouldn\u2019t keep score quarter-to-quarter. But if you want to, this is the first quarter that share buybacks was higher than debt pay down. And if you think about the $4 billion program for three-years, we have gone through 30% of it in about 25% of the time. So we are on pace to do that ahead of schedule. That is the plan. And again, what is most important is we are going to get to that $20 per share run rate cash flow ahead of time and buy back 10% of the market cap over time. So it will play itself out. But we are not dollar cost averaging here with our free cash flow. So it wasn\u2019t ever going to be in such a way as you referenced.\nGeorge Burwell: Okay. Now certainly, all fair points. Maybe just to follow up on Jack\u2019s comments about the confidence on CCL3 volumes possibly coming on a little bit earlier than expected. I mean what supports that confidence? I mean I understand that the project is 38% complete and the construction is 5% complete. How do you see that progressing? And again, like what drives the claim that volumes can come on early?\nJack Fusco: I get a weekly construction report, and I was out at the site myself. There is over 1,000 people there. There is over 10,000 pilings have been installed. Train 1, it is concrete, over 50% complete. The steel is being erected on the [indiscernible]. So as I see that progress is way ahead of schedule. And I know that we have some very critical components for Train 1 that are - have been shipped. They just haven\u2019t been received. So I think on the next call, you guys will get a much more fulfilling update on the schedule, but that is what gives me my optimism.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Nolan with Stifel.\nBenjamin Nolan: I guess I will put both of these into one. There has been some issues with congestion and water levels and that sort of thing around the Panama. Now I\u2019m curious if that is impacting how you guys are managing your book? And then also, there is a lot of speculation there is likely to be a pretty high increase in - or upward movement in freight costs into the back half of the year. Curious where your freight book looks like at the moment.\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Thanks, Ben. So you are absolutely right. The Canal has had an issue with drought. Clearly, it is something that we are very close to, the canal is very good partner, and it is - it continues to be a good partner and will be for decades to come. Equally, obviously, Europe has been the market of choice. So that does not affect us nearly as much as it would have. And we also have the capacity to address that by going around instead of through the canal, which obviously takes longer, but equally obviously saves you the transit fees on the canal. So all of that is included in our guidance and in our economics, and we do look forward to continuing to work with the canal and finding good solutions there. And in terms of costs, you are referring to sort of charter rates as they continue to be elevated in the back half of the year, driven primarily by the contango into Europe. And of course, as you know, we have our requirements fully covered and our shipping position reflects that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig with Tuohy Brothers.\nCraig Shere: And I understand Trains eight and nine for Corpus are significantly hedged on some costs. But we are hearing more and more about EPC price inflation post Port Arthur and Rio Grande FIDs. And I wonder if you could opine on the broader market trends in terms of - we used to be looking at six times EBITDA in projects, now maybe somewhere in the seven times might be more reasonable, but some peers might be pressured even at eight times. In terms of peer FIDs, the pressure on the market and how you would think about economics and hurdle rates for SPL Stage 5, can you kind of give us your thoughts?\nZach Davis: Sure. So yes, we have heard about - all of the other projects mind you, they are Greenfield, et cetera. But as we think about it, if we could sign up the contracts like Anatol and the team has been doing and can do it around, let\u2019s say, seven times CapEx or better, and then you fund it around 50% leverage. We are talking about sub-four times easy on the credit metrics, and you likely can still get to 10% or better on unlevered returns. We are going to do that all day. And not only are we going to do that all day, we are still going to wholly own these projects. We just have a different dynamic economically with an investment-grade balance sheet, cash flowing in the billions and having already spent $40 billion that structurally and financially, it is just no comparison. So yes, I guess, kudos to some of these folks for getting their projects to the starting line. But again, we have a really nice hand to play here at both sides.\nCraig Shere: As we go into the next decade, do you see this basically as a systemic competitive advantage that the field is just going to permanently be windowed?\nZach Davis: We honestly don\u2019t - we have to focus on what we do here, and Jack reiterates that all the time to us as we execute on these projects. Again, if the economics don\u2019t align, we will be patient, we will be disciplined, and we will just keep on buying back the stock and letting all the shareholders that already believe in Cheniere own more and more of Sabine and Corpus in the meantime. And then when they do align and it is clearly accretive, we are going to go for it. And that is it. So if some other folks get projects done, so be it. But again, this industry is probably going to double in the next 20-years or so. And Cheniere is not going to build all of it because we are not doing this for market share.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Mosca with Mizuho Securities.\nRobert Mosca: Just wondering if you could talk about some of the debottlecking activity you have undertaken at your non-train portfolio and when or whether you think you could start to push towards maybe the higher end of that 4.9 to 5.1 MTPA per train run rate?\nJack Fusco: Yes. this is Jack. Yes, I will tell you, Robert, I have been more and more impressed with what my operating folks have been able to do. And I am optimistic that they will continue to deliver on it. I think our guidance is right around five. My expectation over time is that it is going to be a little higher than that. When we guide to the five million tons that included and includes our major maintenance that we just talked about. We had significant major maintenance in this quarter and we are still able to hit the five million tons. So we are not ready to guide above it just yet, but stay tuned.\nRobert Mosca: Great. Appreciate it, Jack. And for my follow-up question. I know in the past, it really has been a part of the playbook to take on equity partners for projects. But any revised thoughts on your appetite if there is a high-quality partner that could also sign up for a chunk of uptake since it seems like those opportunities may still be in the marketplace?\nJack Fusco: Well, as you know, we have some great equity partners with Blackstone and Brookfield and I have had a long relationship with them, and they have been very, very good partners for us at SPL. As Zach mentioned, his intent is to fund it with internal equity, internal capital down at CQP as well as some debt for our expansions. We don\u2019t see a need to have to complicate our lives with more equity partners than we currently have today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: I want to ask too about the near-term outlook. There is a lot of concerns around European gas storage filling and potential pressure on MVP pricing. And I understand that it will have a limited impact to your earnings on 2023 given the way you have locked in pricing. But as you look to 2024, does the prospect of kind of more volatile gas dynamics impact the way you think about hedging your volume exposure next year, either doing some earlier or potentially waiting until after you get through the fall volatility?\nZach Davis: This is Zach. I\u2019m going to start and then Anatol can give a viewpoint on the market. But basically, I pretty much look at our EBITDA forecast daily, our cash flow forecast daily and the volatility of the commodity curve definitely moves quite a bit, but the volatility in our EBITDA just doesn\u2019t period. Like next year, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, might be our most derisked and most contracted year we will ever have. We will have less than 100 TBtu open, we will be like almost 98% or something like that contracted with all of the contracts starting up and that will be the case until we have some of that acceleration of Stage-3 ramping up. So there is not really a need to hedge or contract anything over what we already have. This was always baked into the 2020 vision into the $20-plus billion of available cash. And yes, we are pretty locked in for the next year or two until that Stage-3 comes online.\nAnatol Feygin: Yes and just to follow-up. What is critical for us and things that we look at, Europe this year will add order of magnitude 60 million tons of import capacity. That obviously comes with storage capacity as well. Asia is on track to match that and in the coming years, exceed that. Europe will add 100 million tons overall probably through this build. . Our customers will enjoy and as Zach said, this year and next year and really into the mid-30s, we are overwhelmingly contracted, and they will enjoy very stable pricing and we will enjoy the ability to bring volumes into various markets as those markets send the right price signal. So the way we look at it, the best case scenario is we continue to perform. Our operational excellence continues to deliver these volumes. Our customers enjoy those stable economics, and the world has the capacity to consume these additional volumes. Could you see more volatility? Sure. But we doubt that you will see a repeat of 2022 anytime soon, and the world will put tools in place to address that.\nJean Salisbury: Great. And just a quick follow-up on the other revenue bucket that you disclosed in your earnings. I think a lot of that has to do with chartering out vessels. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong. But given the outlook that fleet rates are going to continue to move higher, should we expect other revenues bucket to continue to grow?\nZach Davis: I will say we don\u2019t forecast anything that is not firm. So I look at Corey and the team, and we do expect them to take a full advantage of the system and the assets that we have every day looking forward. On top of that, though, we are pretty firm for the rest of this year. I mean we have less than 10 TBTU even open, and some of the upside in the guidance today was things that not only subchartering year-to-date, but some that they locked in for the rest of the year. So there could be some, but it is getting smaller and smaller as we get further along in the year.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Chris Tsung with Webber Research.\nChris Tsung: I wanted to just ask if you have noticed any impact from the DOE policy that has reduced the number of viable U.S. LNG projects? And would you anticipate that affecting the cadence of your filing process?\nJack Fusco: No. All of our projects what make our filings are already either fully commercialized or will be -- are well on their way to being commercialized. So there is no question of the need, and we should need significant extensions like we did during COVID. .\nChris Tsung: Okay. And just as a follow-up, we are seeing green shoots in the long-term pricing market with prices inching up above like 250 or so. And we also noticed [Nex] (Ph) amended its pricing across several of its SPAs ahead of their FID. Is that something you are seeing as well as you term out your merchant book and commercialize SPLC chart?\nJack Fusco: Yes, you are probably seeing that folks with the previous questions around inflation, they can\u2019t seem to make their numbers without having some price escalation. So that is probably what you are seeing around the market. And it is not easy to get a Greenfield project off the ground.\nJack Fusco: And thanks, everybody. Thanks for your support of Cheniere and we will talk soon. .\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Anatol Feygin",
            "content": "Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Throughout the second quarter, international gas benchmarks continue to moderate briefly returning to single-digit territory as global inventory levels reach historic highs amid mild weather and tepid macroeconomic activity in most of the key demand centers. Although the extreme prices and volatility of 2022 appear to be in the rearview mirror, prices remain above historical norms and the market continues to react to news of any potential disruption. TTF contract settled at $7.75 in MMBtu, the lowest monthly settlement since April of 2021, but it is higher more recently, selling July at $11.30 due to extended maintenance in Norway. Similarly, JKM delivery prices dropped from about $14 an MMBtu for April to settle around $9.60 for July and back up around $11.90 MMBTU for August thanks to cooling demand load, LNG outages and summer maintenance. In the U.S., mild weather and production growth kept Henry Hub prices below $3 during the quarter, incentivizing coal-to-gas switching, which, along with lower renewable generation and coal retirement have significantly increased power sector demand, helping balance the market. Strong summer cooling demand along with the return of LNG facilities for maintenance has provided milder support to prices with the August contracts settling just below $2.50. While concerns about near-term market tightness have moderated amid softer near-term fundamentals and continued uncertainty around the pace of China's recovery, we still view the market to be structurally tight and delicately balanced over the next few years as very limited new supply is set to enter the market globally, leaving further potential for upside risks going forward. With that in mind, let's now turn to Slide 9 to address regional dynamics in more detail, starting with Europe. During the second quarter, Europe's LNG imports continue to grow year-on-year despite ongoing efforts to reduce gas consumption. LNG flows to Europe grew 9% year-on-year or 2.7 million tons for the second quarter on the back of strong U.S. growth in April and May. June imports were relatively flat driving TTF prices near precrises levels before picking up again on news on an extended outage at Hammerfest LNG and other gas processing facilities. Reduced gas consumption coupled with elevated gas processing facilities. Reduced gas consumption coupled with elevated storage levels at the top of the five-year range, continue to weigh on the European market with data from the IEA suggesting the total European gas demand fell by more than 30 BCM in the first half of 2023. Total electricity generation has declined considerably, falling 9% in the first half of 2023 relative to historic averages, largely as a result of the Russian and Ukraine war and slower economic growth throughout the region. This decline, coupled with notable gains in renewable power generation, resulted in lower demand for thermal generation further contributing to the decline in total gas consumption. However, we started to see a deceleration of these trends in the second quarter as gas burn economics improve. Once overall energy demand levels are gradually restored in Europe, we expect natural gas to regain its share in the supply stack and maintain its critical role in Europe's power mix. Furthermore, the coal, lignite and nuclear base load capacity retirement is currently underway in Germany and other European countries should increase demand for gas capacity to maintain grid reliability and flexibility in the power supply stack amid increasing renewable capacity. Let's now turn to Slide 10 to discuss Asia. While LNG demand across Asia has remained largely subdued year-to-date, increased imports in China, South and Southeast Asia during the quarter were offset by further demand decline in Japan with only 14 million tons of LNG imported by the country in the second quarter, representing an 18% decline year-on-year. In fact, May registered the lowest import levels in Japan in 15-years as consumers were incentivized to conserve energy amid electricity rate hikes. Additionally, nuclear availability impacted gas demand in the power sector. We expect this trend to continue as two additional nuclear reactors in Japan are scheduled to restart in the third quarter. Similarly, we expect to see nuclear pressures on LNG spot buying in Korea too where LNG imports were flat in Q2 with the start-up of the 1.4 gigawatt Shin Hanul 1 nuclear plant last year and the expected startup of the similarly sized Shin Hanul 2 in the third quarter of this year. In India, imports during the quarter trended slightly higher compared to last year, increasing by about 4% year-on-year. Despite the further decline in JKM, prices remained too elevated during the quarter to elicit a meaningful response from price-sensitive South Asian buyers. Southeast Asian demand showed significant growth during the quarter as imports increased 31% year-on-year. Thailand, the main driver of the region's demand grew imports 43% or one million tons in Q2 amid a heat wave that sent temperature soaring. Southeast Asia is expected to be an important growth market in the future as it expands its import infrastructure. The region added a new market in the second quarter as the Philippines imported its first cargo in April. And just last month, Vietnam started commissioning its first regas terminal to service a new 1.5 gigawatt gas-fired power plant. In China, LNG imports picked up in the second quarter, increasing 20% year-on-year. A warm and dry summer triggered a rebound in spot buying activity as a persistent heat wave and low hydropower generation output increased demand for natural gas. China's hydropower dropped 28% year-on-year in the first half of 2023, helping boost electricity demand from other sources, including gas. In fact, during the quarter, overall gas demand grew 10% year-on-year despite some macroeconomic headwinds in China. Let's now turn to Slide 11 for some thoughts on the market for long-term contracting. Despite some of the near-term market dynamics discussed earlier, pointing to potentially softened demand for LNG in the front of the curve, which as Jack noted, we are largely insulated from, over the last 12-months to 18-months, we have witnessed record levels of long-term contracting, particularly for U.S. volumes as the long-term trade outlook continues to call for further growth in LNG supply. In aggregate, the level of long-term Henry Hub linked contract signed in 2022 alone far exceeded the total signed over the six preceding years combined and the market looks to be on track to potentially repeat this level of contract activity this year. As we previously discussed, we expect demand from China and other fast-growing Asian economies to underpin the next LNG supply wave, representing over 70% of the LNG demand growth through 2040. Asian demand, coupled with Europe's desire to replace Russian supply has driven recent commercial activity. Although Asian customers and portfolio players have been the largest and most active buyers of long-term volumes globally over the past 18-months, European counterparties have certainly stepped up, signing contracts representing over 20 MTPA of which 18 MTPA is tied to U.S. projects or about a quarter of the total U.S. volumes signed since 2022. At Cheniere, we have signed over 15 million tons of long-term contracts in just the last 18 months, 30% of which are expected to underpin our future growth at both Corpus and Sabine Pass. While mid-scale Trains 8 and 9 are fully commercialized, the origination team is hard at work constructing the portfolio for the SPL expansion project. As Jack mentioned, our success to date has been a direct result of our resolute commitment to operational excellence and financial discipline across everything that we do. Our contract portfolio today is comprised of a diverse mix of contract structures with varying terms and tenors, all of which were signed with high-quality, creditworthy and geographically diverse counterparties who value the flexibility and reliability of our products. In fact, several of our recently signed contracts were signed with repeat customers, ENN and Equinor most recently, but also EOG, ENGIE and Petro China last year, signaling the mutual commitment to quality we share with our long-term customers. As we continue to commercialize our growth projects, this commitment will remain steadfast. With that, I will turn the call over to Zach to review our financial results and guidance. Yes. Thanks, Simon. I do think that European sort of direct end users will continue to be part of the long-term sort of support equation for U.S. projects. My comments were kind of in the context of Europe not being as big a piece of the equation in 2022 as I would have expected and that has changed slightly, but it is still only a quarter. And the vast majority of that volume moving forward will still be addressed by intermediaries who are still half of that volume. So it has improved. I expect that to continue to be a healthy market for long-term commitments, but it will still be very much intermediated by portfolio players as well. Yes. Sure, Brian. As we have said in the past, we view the gas supply component of our projects as an absolutely critical step, and we would not pursue a project that did not have a robust gas supply solution. That said, we view the Permian as a great source, not just for Corpus and this expansion but also for the expansion of Sabine, and we will continue to work with our infrastructure partners to find the best options for supplying the Sabine expansion. So whether that includes equity or not, TBD, obviously, we are not opposed to that, as you saw with our project into the Corpus expansion. And all of those options are on the table. Yes. Thanks, Ben. So you are absolutely right. The Canal has had an issue with drought. Clearly, it is something that we are very close to, the canal is very good partner, and it is - it continues to be a good partner and will be for decades to come. Equally, obviously, Europe has been the market of choice. So that does not affect us nearly as much as it would have. And we also have the capacity to address that by going around instead of through the canal, which obviously takes longer, but equally obviously saves you the transit fees on the canal. So all of that is included in our guidance and in our economics, and we do look forward to continuing to work with the canal and finding good solutions there. And in terms of costs, you are referring to sort of charter rates as they continue to be elevated in the back half of the year, driven primarily by the contango into Europe. And of course, as you know, we have our requirements fully covered and our shipping position reflects that. Yes and just to follow-up. What is critical for us and things that we look at, Europe this year will add order of magnitude 60 million tons of import capacity. That obviously comes with storage capacity as well. Asia is on track to match that and in the coming years, exceed that. Europe will add 100 million tons overall probably through this build. . Our customers will enjoy and as Zach said, this year and next year and really into the mid-30s, we are overwhelmingly contracted, and they will enjoy very stable pricing and we will enjoy the ability to bring volumes into various markets as those markets send the right price signal. So the way we look at it, the best case scenario is we continue to perform. Our operational excellence continues to deliver these volumes. Our customers enjoy those stable economics, and the world has the capacity to consume these additional volumes. Could you see more volatility? Sure. But we doubt that you will see a repeat of 2022 anytime soon, and the world will put tools in place to address that."

            "name": "Jack Fusco",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today as we review our second quarter results and improved full-year 2023 outlook. Following a record-breaking year for the LNG industry, activity levels particularly in the U.S. remain elevated with significant commercial momentum and multiple projects having reached FID this year as energy consumers worldwide look to secure cost competitive, reliable natural gas supply in pursuit of achieving evolving energy, economic and environmental policies and goals. Such activity confirms liquefied natural gas as a preferred clean energy solution underscoring its critical long-term role in the global energy mix. Recently, the short-term global gas benchmarks have been volatile as markets try to adjust to a multitude of factors like weather, storage and economic growth that drive all commodity businesses. With over 150 million tons under construction globally and expected to come online over this decade, we expect pockets of volatility in the future as the market adjusts and absorbs this new supply. Cheniere is built to thrive in this volatility as a highly contracted nature of our cash flow profile ensures visibility in our returns, while maintaining some exposure to the upside when markets dislocate like they did last year. At Cheniere, our focus is centered on the long-term fundamentals for natural gas worldwide and today, those fundamentals remain as strong as ever, with the global LNG market expected to nearly double by 2040, hundreds of millions of tons of new LNG capacity will need to be developed to meet this demand and our platform is ideally set up to enable us to accretively capture our fair share. Please turn to Slide 5, where we will review key operational and financial highlights from the second quarter 2023 and introduce our upwardly revised full-year financial guidance. The second quarter was once again highlighted by excellent performance across the Cheniere platform. First and foremost, our relentless focus on operational excellence continues to set us apart and the successful completion of our planned maintenance at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi during the quarter further reinforces our execution capabilities and our stellar operating reputation that our long-term customers expect and appreciate. Also during the quarter, our commercial momentum on the SPL expansion project accelerated with three new long-term SPA in support of that project. And on project execution, Bechtel continues to progress Corpus Christi Stage-3 well ahead of schedule, increasing my optimism for that project being completed ahead of the guaranteed date. We have generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.9 billion in the second quarter, distributable cash flow of approximately $1.4 billion and net income of approximately $1.4 billion. These outstanding financial results are the product of our safe, stable and reliable operations at our facilities. Those operations resulted in the export of 149 cargoes in the second quarter, down from the record levels we have set in recent quarters due to the planned maintenance that was performed. And I will review the major turnaround at Sabine Pass in more detail in a minute. Looking ahead to the balance of 2023, our forecast has improved slightly. And today, we are raising our full-year guidance ranges by $100 million to $8.3 billion to $8.8 billion of consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion of DCF. The increase is mainly driven by the release of the remaining few cargoes that have been reserved for origination this year as well as some optimization and subchartering activity. Zach will provide more color on the guidance, but we have excellent visibility into the balance of the year, and we are confident in our ability to finish the year within these new ranges. During the second quarter, Zach and his team continued to progress on our comprehensive capital allocation plan. We paid down another $200-plus million of long-term debt. We bought back over two million shares for $337 million, and we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.395. In addition, we opportunistically refinanced our next debt maturity enabling further financial flexibility and doing so in a cost-efficient manner. On Stage-3, we continue to equity fund that project, investing approximately $200 million during the quarter and over $2 billion to-date. As I mentioned on the last earnings call, certain construction activities on Stage-3 are taking place ahead of plan, and I remain optimistic and schedule outperformance and potentially having more LNG volumes in 2025 and possibly the entire Seven Train project complete by the end of 2026. Stage-3 is over 38% complete, and the construction activities continue to ramp up as we now have nearly 1,000 personnel on site. In fact, during the second quarter, the first structural still was erected, an important milestone for Stage-3 as construction activities advanced and the project begins to take shape. Anatol and his team were also extremely busy in the second quarter as we signed 3 new long-term SPAs, which are expected to support the SPL expansion project. The SPAs are with Korea Southern Power and repeat customers Equinor and ENN and represent a mix of FOB and DES terms. The SPAs aggregates to just under four million tons per annum, each with a certain amount of volume tied to an FID of the First Train of the SPL expansion project. While it is early the diversity of this growing, creditworthy contract portfolio speaks to not only the strength and the long-term fundamentals of the LNG market, but also the value of the LNG marketplaces on Cheniere specifically. Turn now to Slide 6. You might recall last year, we sanctioned Corpus Christi Stage-3 with a diverse portfolio of FOB, DES and IPM contracts signed with customers from Asia to Europe to North America, featuring utility end users and portfolio players alike. Our customer portfolio is a result of continuous commercial innovation, in a customer-focused strategy that prioritizes collaboration and tailored energy solutions for our customers. We expect the contract portfolio on the SPL expansion project to reflect similar diversity and our early progress with KOSPO, Equinor and ENN, all investment-grade counterparties certainly support that. We are extremely excited about the commercial momentum we have gained on the SPL expansion project in such a short time, and I'm optimistic there is more long-term business to do in support of the project this year. We look forward to continuing to build on the contract portfolio that features the breadth, depth and scale that sets us apart from the competition. Turn now to Slide 7. I will provide some details around the major maintenance turnaround we completed on Sabine Pass Trains 1 and 2 during the quarter. This was the largest maintenance turnaround we have completed yet at Cheniere. And first and foremost, I'm proud to say the event was completed successfully on schedule and most importantly, with zero recordable or loss time injuries. The turnaround was successful, not only in terms of the important maintenance work executed under Trains 1 and 2, but also as it provides a foundation and some significant lessons learned as we conduct planning for future large-scale maintenance turnarounds. During the month of June, Trains 1 and 2 at SPL were offline for about 25 days. In approximately a 25-day span, we had an incremental approximate 1,400 personnel on site at Sabine Pass. Those personnel completed approximately 10,000 total tasks across 2,000 work orders with all of that work requiring over 2,250 permits to be issued. To have an effort like that completed in under four weeks, speaks to the enormous amount of planning and preparation ahead of time as well as an excellent execution and coordination throughout the event. I would like to recognize all those involved, especially our Cheniere personnel and our long-time equipment partners at Baker Hughes for delivering outstanding results and further reinforcing Cheniere's reputation for successful execution and demonstrating our safety-first culture from start to finish. The success of this major turnaround provides enormous benefits to Cheniere as well as our customers as we will use our experiences to inform maintenance planning in the future as well as with the goal of remaining a world-class operator in the eyes of the LNG industry, employees and stakeholders alike. Stable and reliable operations have never been more critical as energy security concerns have become a significant priority around the world, and our dependable operations continue to grow as a distinct competitive advantage. Last month at the LNG 2023 Industry Conference in Vancouver, energy security and reliable LNG operations were primary themes in the hallways and in the presentations on the main stage. I was proud to hear many of our long-term customers acknowledge and thank Cheniere specifically for being such a reliable and responsible LNG supplier. The value of that track record is clearly being demonstrated evidenced by not only the financial results and guidance we reported this morning, but also by the four million tons per annum of contracts we signed this quarter. We will continue to press this and our many other competitive advantages as we commercialize additional capacity on the Sabine Pass expansion project. On that note, I will hand it over to Anatol to further address the LNG market and our commercial strategy. Thank you all again for your continued support of Cheniere. Jean, I'm not expecting much. We have been very effective with Bechtel on buying materials when we see low points. I think our overall inflationary environment has been around 10% so far from us being working closely and collaboratively with Bechtel on the procurement. So I would expect that to be the same for eight and nine also. But it is hard to make that comparison, right, from a single train confined - I mean I have spent a lot of time down in that part of the woods. As you all know, I have a house in Annapolis and there is no growth potential to compare Cove Point to Cheniere is not even close to being correct. But you want to get through the share. Cameron, this is Jack. I will start off. And the answer on the first one was exposure to the commodity markets. I would say no. We are going to do this the way we have done trains in the past. We are going to use our financial discipline. We are going to commercialize 85% to 90% of the output of the train that we feel comfortable that we can reliably serve and make sure it meets all of our financial criteria that Zach and the team have laid out many times in the past. . As you know, I have spent time in the power business, and that was almost a 100% merchant day in and day out. And I felt like a farmer, I was always worried about the weather. And we have no desire to invest billions of dollars - continue to invest billions of dollars in American infrastructure and pray that commodity markets will come back our way. So that is the first part. And then second question was on the regulatory structure or recent regulatory developments. I mean I, for one, I'm guardedly optimistic. I think under Chairman Philips, FERC is trying to act a little more in a bipartisan way. They have approved some major natural gas projects and specifically some LNG projects to go - to move forward, and that is been very positive all the way around that things are actually being reviewed and approved in FERC. And then similarly, I would say at the DOE, Secretary, Granholm was very clear when she discussed the critical role of U.S. LNG to support our allies and testimony that you recently gave to the House of Representatives. So those to me are really positive developments on the regulatory front for our expansion opportunities. I get a weekly construction report, and I was out at the site myself. There is over 1,000 people there. There is over 10,000 pilings have been installed. Train 1, it is concrete, over 50% complete. The steel is being erected on the [indiscernible]. So as I see that progress is way ahead of schedule. And I know that we have some very critical components for Train 1 that are - have been shipped. They just haven't been received. So I think on the next call, you guys will get a much more fulfilling update on the schedule, but that is what gives me my optimism. Yes. this is Jack. Yes, I will tell you, Robert, I have been more and more impressed with what my operating folks have been able to do. And I am optimistic that they will continue to deliver on it. I think our guidance is right around five. My expectation over time is that it is going to be a little higher than that. When we guide to the five million tons that included and includes our major maintenance that we just talked about. We had significant major maintenance in this quarter and we are still able to hit the five million tons. So we are not ready to guide above it just yet, but stay tuned. Well, as you know, we have some great equity partners with Blackstone and Brookfield and I have had a long relationship with them, and they have been very, very good partners for us at SPL. As Zach mentioned, his intent is to fund it with internal equity, internal capital down at CQP as well as some debt for our expansions. We don't see a need to have to complicate our lives with more equity partners than we currently have today. No. All of our projects what make our filings are already either fully commercialized or will be -- are well on their way to being commercialized. So there is no question of the need, and we should need significant extensions like we did during COVID. . Yes, you are probably seeing that folks with the previous questions around inflation, they can't seem to make their numbers without having some price escalation. So that is probably what you are seeing around the market. And it is not easy to get a Greenfield project off the ground. And thanks, everybody. Thanks for your support of Cheniere and we will talk soon. ."

            "name": "Zach Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Anatol and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our second quarter 2023 results and key financial accomplishments, all of which are products of our team's dedication to operational excellence, seamless execution and financial discipline as we continue to serve our customers across the world while creating long-term value for our stakeholders. Turning to Slide 13. For the second quarter, we generated net income of approximately $1.4 billion, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.9 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $1.4 billion. Relative to recent quarters, our second quarter results reflect a higher proportion of our LNG being sold under long-term contracts, less volumes being sold into short-term markets, continued moderation of international gas prices as well as the operating cost and production impact from the major turnaround at SPL during the quarter. Once again, these impacts were partially offset by the proactive locking in of a large portion of our open cargoes for the quarter, late last year and earlier this year and margins above what is in the market today. During the second quarter, we recognized in income 561 TBtu of physical LNG, including 547 TBtu from our projects and 14 TBtu sourced from third parties. Approximately 85% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SPA or IPM agreements with initial terms greater than 10-years. As we have noted in prior earnings calls, our reported net income is impacted by the unrealized, non-cash derivative impacts to our revenue and cost of sales line items, which are primarily related to the mismatch of accounting methodology for the purchase of natural gas and the corresponding sale of LNG under our long-term IPM agreements. The further decline in sustained moderation and volatility of international gas price curves throughout the second quarter serve to benefit the mark-to-market valuation of these agreements, increasing our net income line item for the third quarter in a row. With today's results, we have earned cumulative net income of approximately $8.4 billion for the trailing 12-months and have now reported positive net income on a quarterly and cumulative trailing four quarter basis, three quarters in a row. Throughout the quarter, we continue to deploy capital pursuant to our comprehensive capital allocation plan, increasing shareholder returns, strengthening our balance sheet and pursuing accretive growth. In June, we refinanced and replaced our existing secured credit facilities at CQP and SPL with a new $1 billion senior unsecured facility at CQP and a $1 billion senior secured facility at SPL. These transactions extended the original maturities, migrated some capacity from the project to parent, desecured some of our borrowing capacity and further enhanced our liquidity with more flexible terms. These new facilities, combined with the CEI and CCH credit facilities, and our cash on hand, provide ample consolidated available liquidity, affording us even greater optionality as we continue to execute on our long-term capital allocation plan while effectively operating and constructing the second largest LNG platform in the world. During the quarter, we repaid a little over $200 million of long-term indebtedness through our open market repurchase program. Substantially all of which was used to repurchase a portion of the senior secured notes due in 2024 at SPL. In June, we further addressed these notes opportunistically with our inaugural investment-grade offering at the parent level, $1.4 billion of 5.95% senior unsecured notes at CQP. The net proceeds from this offering were used to further refinance and redeem approximately $1.4 billion of the SPL 2024 notes, not only extending our maturity but also desecuring and further desubordinating our balance sheet, all three of which are key tenets to the balance sheet strategy set forth in our capital allocation plan. As discussed on previous calls, we plan to address the remaining balance of the SPL 2024 notes with cash on hand later this year and into next, after which point, we will have addressed all maturities through early 2025. In the meantime, you can expect we will continue to opportunistically delever utilizing our open market repurchase program. On the ratings front, just last week, Fitch upgraded CCH to BBB from BBB-, bringing our project level ratings in line at Fitch. In April, Moody's announced that CEI and CCH were under review, which, if upgraded, would further solidify our corporate structure as investment grade. As noted on the last call, now that we have achieved investment-grade ratings across our corporate structure. Going forward, we are targeting a one-to-one ratio of deleveraging and share buybacks on an aggregate basis. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares of common stock for approximately $337 million. As we have previously noted, there will likely be a catch-up trade over the next year or two in order to achieve that one-to-one ratio, where our opportunistic repurchase plan will outpace debt repayment over that time. We are confident that we will deploy the remaining $2.8 billion of our share repurchase authorization to complete our $4 billion plan ahead of schedule, as our goal to repurchase approximately 10% of the company remains intact. We also declared our eighth quarterly dividend of $0.395 per common share for the second quarter last week. Later this year, we expect to be able to step up the dividend in line with our previous guidance of growing our dividend by approximately 10% annually into the mid-2020s through construction of Stage-3. And for the final pillar of our comprehensive capital allocation plan, disciplined growth, we funded approximately $200 million of CapEx at our Stage-3 project during the quarter with cash on hand as this remained the most efficient form of funding during the quarter. However, we will have over $3 billion available on our CCH term loan that we plan to utilize in the coming years. As Jack mentioned, the Bechtel and Cheniere teams have made meaningful progress year-to-date, so we are optimistic on the timing of those volumes and our ability to bring another over 10 million tons to market ahead of schedule. Turning now to Slide 14, where I will discuss our 2023 guidance and update you on our open capacity for the remainder of the year. Today, we are raising our full-year 2023 guidance ranges by $100 million to $8.3 billion to $8.8 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion in distributable cash flow. With respect to our EBITDA sensitivity for the remainder of the year, we have an immaterial amount of unsold LNG remaining. So we have excellent visibility of delivering results comfortably in these ranges for the year and in cargoes originally reserved for origination. Combined with the incremental margin from optimization activities, this gives us further clarity around our expected financial results for the year and supports the increase to our ranges today. As always, our results could be impacted by the timing of certain year-end cargoes heading into 2024 as well as incremental margin from further optimization of upstream and downstream of our facilities. Our distributable cash flow for 2023 could also be affected by any changes in the tax code under the IRA. However, the guidance provided today is based on the current IRA tax law guidance in which we would not qualify for the minimum corporate tax of 15% this year. However, as noted previously, both of these dynamics would mainly affect timing and not materially impact our cumulative cash flow generation through the mid-2020 as we think about our overall capital allocation plan and our 2020 Vision goals. Similar to this past year, we look forward to providing additional insight on our 2024 production profile and open capacity on our next call in November, with official 2024 financial guidance to come out with our Q4 and full-year 2023 results in February. As we have consistently forecasted, including in our 2020 vision, 2024 may end up being our most contracted year ever on a percentage basis, ahead of Stage-3 coming online in 2025 and 2026, which is expected to grow our operating LNG portfolio to over 55 million tons per annum. Despite some near-term challenges in the market like cost inflation, higher borrowing costs and competition, the global market is clearly calling for new LNG supplies given the many advantages of natural gas as a primary energy source. At Cheniere, we are well positioned and committed to providing energy solutions for our customers, developing and building projects that deliver appropriate risk-adjusted returns for our investors and stakeholders and operating and maintaining our facilities with the safety first culture in order to be the LNG provider of choice for decades to come. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions. Thanks, Jeremy. This is Zach. So as you think about the $4.5 billion of unrestricted cash that had an increment -- in that was a $1.4 billion related to the bond proceeds from the CQP bond we did in late June. That was a refinancing that was executed in early July. So you have to take at least $1.4 billion out of that. And then when you think about how much is actually sitting at CEI versus CQP, it is in the mid-2s. So clearly, there is ample liquidity when you consider that our guidance of $6 billion of DCF or so, and we have made around $4 billion of that to date. So when you think about liquidity, we like to keep around $1 billion on the balance sheet at all times, give or take. We probably have around another $1 billion to spend on the Corpus Stage-3 project this year and then the dividend that were set to increase in Q3, like the guidance that we had last year. So you take all that into account, there is still probably a couple of billion dollars there. And I will just reiterate what we keep on saying is that we are intent to catch up on the one-to-one cumulative ratio between debt paydown and share buybacks over time. And we are on track to do so. So there will be, over time, billions of dollars allocated to our buyback program. We are just going to stick to our opportunistic approach, abide by 10b5-1 rules, and we will follow through and eventually get to that $20 per share of run rate cash flow. So I guess the good thing on that is no, it doesn't affect run rate EBITDA because we really don't guide to it until it is firm. So as we think about run rate EBITDA over time that is just based on the fixed fees, the open capacity at 2.25 and a basic lifting margin. That is it. So these are the types of examples that are the incremental optionality that comes with like the Cheniere platform from our Brownfield growth to the opportunities upstream with lifting margin and being such a big customer to most of the pipes upstream of the plant and the biggest consumer of natural gas in the United States to being a relatively big charter with our DES and IPM deals. So basically, what happened in the quarter was we firmed up the more of the sub chartering, let's say, of some of our length on our shipping portfolio. And once that is firm, I see it in the guidance and that helps move the numbers upward. Add to that we released those four origination cargoes. Anatol and the team build another four million tons without meeting needing much in terms of bridging, and we were pretty much obligated to increase guidance by $100 million this quarter. Sure. I think there is more dynamics to this than just looking at the multiple. I think they sold to an existing operator, an existing owner and it is probably the easiest way for Dominion to get out of the business. But if you account for no growth to customers, polling versus our FOB, BS , IPM, CMI model, where you get all the steady cash flows, but also, like this quarter, incremental cash flow from all the optionality that comes with the platform. I think it only reaffirms that we are going to get a premium valuation to anything that Cove Point has or something like that. So that is how we think about it. And clearly, even at the share price today, we are barely getting valued at that type of multiple. And what we are pretty keen on is every turn on that multiple is probably over $25 to the share price. So we will take it. And yes, I just wouldn't say it is apples-to-apples. Sure. So it will be a debt and internal equity funding for that project over time. And we will start thinking about that now - we are thinking about the next few years as we are in development. what is the leverage metric should be going into FID. And honestly, the lower those leverage metrics are going into FID, more capacity we would have to lever up to help funding during construction of the project. So anything that we pay down going forward inside the CQP box is honestly like a pre-investment for that expansion. And as we look at our metrics on a consolidated basis, we are right under four times. CQP is a little over four times. So it will make sense for some of the debt paydown going forward to be inside that CQP box. And with that, it will give us even more funding flexibility when it comes to FID in a couple of years where we will live within cash flows, maintain a base distribution and most importantly, maintain those investment-grade credit metrics so that eventually that, let's say, high $3 DPU run rate can get to something like $5 or better. Sure. I'm going to go back to the fact that we are thinking about this in the 2020 vision through 2026, and we have a three-year plan for $4 billion. And on a cumulative basis, we will get there on a one-to-one debt pay down to share buyback and to focus quarter-by-quarter is honestly not how we are looking at it. But again, if you just look at the time you are referencing where the stock was probably like $20, $25 lower than where it is today, clearly, if there has been pressure for a continued period of time, we probably would have been able to buy more. But abiding by 10b5-1 rules, we are not ones that are allowed to affect the share price. We are not allowed to buy at the opening or at the end of the day, and there is a myriad of other rules that we have to be careful of that, yes, when there is only three-days of extreme pressure at a certain price level, we can't be a majority of it. . So I wouldn't keep score quarter-to-quarter. But if you want to, this is the first quarter that share buybacks was higher than debt pay down. And if you think about the $4 billion program for three-years, we have gone through 30% of it in about 25% of the time. So we are on pace to do that ahead of schedule. That is the plan. And again, what is most important is we are going to get to that $20 per share run rate cash flow ahead of time and buy back 10% of the market cap over time. So it will play itself out. But we are not dollar cost averaging here with our free cash flow. So it wasn't ever going to be in such a way as you referenced. Sure. So yes, we have heard about - all of the other projects mind you, they are Greenfield, et cetera. But as we think about it, if we could sign up the contracts like Anatol and the team has been doing and can do it around, let's say, seven times CapEx or better, and then you fund it around 50% leverage. We are talking about sub-four times easy on the credit metrics, and you likely can still get to 10% or better on unlevered returns. We are going to do that all day. And not only are we going to do that all day, we are still going to wholly own these projects. We just have a different dynamic economically with an investment-grade balance sheet, cash flowing in the billions and having already spent $40 billion that structurally and financially, it is just no comparison. So yes, I guess, kudos to some of these folks for getting their projects to the starting line. But again, we have a really nice hand to play here at both sides. We honestly don't - we have to focus on what we do here, and Jack reiterates that all the time to us as we execute on these projects. Again, if the economics don't align, we will be patient, we will be disciplined, and we will just keep on buying back the stock and letting all the shareholders that already believe in Cheniere own more and more of Sabine and Corpus in the meantime. And then when they do align and it is clearly accretive, we are going to go for it. And that is it. So if some other folks get projects done, so be it. But again, this industry is probably going to double in the next 20-years or so. And Cheniere is not going to build all of it because we are not doing this for market share. This is Zach. I'm going to start and then Anatol can give a viewpoint on the market. But basically, I pretty much look at our EBITDA forecast daily, our cash flow forecast daily and the volatility of the commodity curve definitely moves quite a bit, but the volatility in our EBITDA just doesn't period. Like next year, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, might be our most derisked and most contracted year we will ever have. We will have less than 100 TBtu open, we will be like almost 98% or something like that contracted with all of the contracts starting up and that will be the case until we have some of that acceleration of Stage-3 ramping up. So there is not really a need to hedge or contract anything over what we already have. This was always baked into the 2020 vision into the $20-plus billion of available cash. And yes, we are pretty locked in for the next year or two until that Stage-3 comes online. I will say we don't forecast anything that is not firm. So I look at Corey and the team, and we do expect them to take a full advantage of the system and the assets that we have every day looking forward. On top of that, though, we are pretty firm for the rest of this year. I mean we have less than 10 TBTU even open, and some of the upside in the guidance today was things that not only subchartering year-to-date, but some that they locked in for the rest of the year. So there could be some, but it is getting smaller and smaller as we get further along in the year."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Randy Bhatia. Please go ahead.\nRandy Bhatia: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Cheniere's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. The slide presentation and access for the webcast for today's call are available at cheniere.com. Joining me this morning are Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO; Anatol Feygin, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Zach Davis, Executive Vice President and CFO; and other members of Cheniere's senior management.  Before we begin, I would like to remind all listeners that our remarks, including answers to your questions, may contain forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from what is described in these statements. Slide 2 of our presentation contains a discussion of those forward-looking statements and associated risks. In addition, we may include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the appendix to the slide presentation.  As part of our discussion of Cheniere's results, today's call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP, or CQP. We do not intend to cover CQP's results separately from those of Cheniere Energy, Inc. The call agenda is shown on Slide 3. Jack will begin with operating and financial highlights. Anatol will then provide an update on the LNG market, and Zach will review our financial results and 2023 guidance. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A.  I will now turn the call over to Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO.\nJack Fusco: Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning as we review our first quarter results and improve 2023 outlook. As you can see from the results, we have continued our exceptional performance from 2022 and our improved outlook for the rest of this year is reflected in our increased guidance ranges. The first quarter was highlighted by excellent performance across Cheniere's platform from operations to project execution to capital allocation and origination.  While we are not yet able to share specific details, last week, we executed a new long-term SPA with an investment-grade Asian end user that is linked to the SPL expansion project. This is an exciting signal that we are already gaining early commercial momentum on our recently announced expansion plans at Sabine Pass. We look forward to providing more detail on this SPA in the near future.  Please turn to Slide 5, where I'll review key operational and financial highlights from the first quarter 2023, and introduce our upwardly revised annual financial guidance. We generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $3.6 billion in the first quarter and distributable cash flow of nearly $3 billion. The first quarter benefited from a number of discrete factors which drove EBITDA and DCF higher, which Zach will address in a few minutes.  During the first quarter, Zach and his team continued to make excellent progress on our capital allocation plan. We paid down nearly $900 million of debt and solidified investment-grade ratings across the Cheniere complex as we discussed on this past February call. We bought back over 3 million shares for about $450 million and paid our quarterly dividend of $39.5.  So in total, almost $1.5 billion in capital return during the quarter, plus another approximately $550 million invested as Stage 3 for our future growth. Operationally, in the first quarter, we picked up right where we left off last year. Further reinforcing Cheniere status as a leading global operator, reliably producing LNG with safety at the foundation of every action we take. We set a new quarterly record exporting 167 cargoes of LNG in the first quarter, surpassing our prior record, which was set in the fourth quarter of last year.  Looking ahead to the balance of 2023, as I mentioned before, our forecast has improved. We are raising full year guidance by $200 million on both EBITDA and distributable cash flow. Our new ranges are $8.2 billion to $8.7 billion in EBITDA and $5.7 billion to $6.2 billion in DCF. The increase is mainly driven by the team capturing and locking in higher margins, both upstream and downstream of our facility. Zach will provide more color on the increase and preemptively answer your questions on guidance in a few minutes.  Turn now to Slide 6, where I will update you on the status of our expansion projects, Corpus Christi Stage 3, which is under construction, Corpus Christi mid-scale trains 8 and 9, which is now in the FERC process and SPL expansion, which is in the prefiling with FERC. First, on Corpus Christi Stage 3. Destructions ramping up as its head count on the site, which is now approximately 750 workers, and we expect this to grow rapidly as we begin to transform from site preparation and groundwork into mechanical works over the coming months. Over 7,000 piles have been driven and soil stabilization is effectively complete. The foundations are beginning to be poured. Piping and spools have begun to arrive, and we expect to receive the first coal box at site next month, and its installation is an important construction milestone for Stage 3.  Overall, EPC progress is currently 28.7%, which is well ahead of plan. While construction is only 3.4% complete, early construction activities are already tracking ahead of schedule, increasing my confidence in schedule outperformance and potentially having more volumes in 2025 and possibly the entire 7 Train project being completed by the end of 2026, months ahead of the guaranteed schedule.  Next, on Corpus Christi, mid-scale trains 8 and 9, in line with what we told you last year when we prefiled this project. We submitted a full application to FERC on trains 8 and 9 in late March. We are optimistic about the permitting process for this project, given its distinct advantages of being identical to Stage 3 trains, being fully commercialized with creditworthy counterparties and not requiring significant supporting infrastructure. And the synergy of Bechtel already being mobilized on the site. We look forward to working with FERC and all relevant stakeholder agencies and regulators on a smooth and transparent review process.  Moving on to the Sabine Pass expansion project, which we revealed on our call back in February. I'm extremely excited about developing this major 20 million-tonne expansion, which has the ability to leverage our massive infrastructure position at Sabine Pass for economically advantaged incremental capacity. We have submitted the prefiling documents to FERC. We recently signed a contract with Bechtel for the FEED work related to this large-scale project, including for the carbon capture component. Commercially, the project is already gaining traction. As I highlighted earlier, last week, we're executing SPA of approximately 0.4 million tonnes per annum for over 20 years with an investment-grade Asian end user for LNG volumes delivered through 2047.  Most of the volumes associated with the SPA are subject to FID of Train 1 of the Sabine Pass expansion project. We are excited to have already signed an SPA linked to the project and to be building commercial momentum as we progress development. We progressed these project developments in an environment marked by cost inflation, rising interest rates and extremely competitive LNG markets. These realities not only underscore the importance of Cheniere's competitive advantages but also our resolute commitment to the investment parameters that guide our disciplined approach to capital investment.  As you have heard me say before, we are not in the FID business. Our focus is on long-term value creation, we are developing these projects with the same discipline, rigor and high standards that form the foundation of our existing infrastructure platform. We are extremely excited about our organic growth prospects, and we continue to target market-leading project returns on a risk-adjusted basis that our investors and stakeholders have come to expect from Cheniere. Thank you all again for your continued support of Cheniere.  I will now turn the call over to Anatol, who will provide an update on the LNG market.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8. The LNG production in the first quarter reached new highs as global reliability improved with record monthly exports of 36 million tonnes in March. Following a period of outages across various plants worldwide, year-over-year increases in production were achieved in Norway, Australia and Qatar in particular. In Norway, the Hammerfest facility was offline in Q1 last year, and in Australia, Prelude was shut down after a loss of power in December 21 and did not restart until April of last year. And in Qatar, 2 megatrains were undergoing major planned maintenance in Q1 last year.  Exports from the U.S. were broadly flat year-over-year as Freeport LNG restarted production in February after having been offline since June of last year. While the uptick in global LNG production over the past few months has helped to balance the market and further stabilize price levels throughout the first quarter, we expect limited overall supply growth this year as few new projects are scheduled to come online in the next 18 months.  Until then, we expect supply and demand to remain precariously balanced and sensitive to supply disruptions, weather and demand shocks. We remain optimistic that the U.S. will continue to be a critical source of flexible supply in the market. U.S. flows to Europe continued to remain strong in Q1, helping ease market pressures and contributing to moderating prices. In fact, approximately 80% of cargoes produced by our 2 sites were delivered to Europe in the first quarter. The TTF monthly settlement prices averaged approximately $19.50 per MMBtu in the first quarter of '23, 35% lower year-on-year. Similarly, the JKM average settlement price decreased by 16% year-on-year to an average of approximately $26 per MMBtu. While both pricing indices are markedly lower than last year, global gas benchmarks remain at elevated levels. Q1 marked an inflection point for average quarterly global gas prices as JKM surpassed TTF for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine last year.  Cheniere's value proposition built on market-leading reliability is, of course, further enhanced by a stable and affordable commodity. In the U.S., in March, the Henry Hub front month contract price fell below $2 in MMBtu for the first time since September of 2020. Henry Hub averaged approximately $3.40 in Q1, and the front month contract is now trading in the mid $2 per MMBtu. Following the elevated pricing in North American gas markets last year, our production response led to a more normalized pricing environment, underscoring the abundance and relative affordability of Gulf Coast LNG.  Now let's turn to Slide 9 to address current European dynamics in some more detail. Europe has closed out this winter with gas inventories at or near the high end of its 5-year range, thanks in part to record mild weather and, of course, sustained LNG flows. LNG imports remained robust, increasing 8% year-over-year despite labor strike activity affecting several French terminals in March. U.S. exports to Europe increased approximately 4% year-on-year in Q1 and about 15% quarter-over-quarter. The addition of 5 FSRUs over the past few months across the Netherlands, Germany and Finland, helped increase LNG import capacity and reduce locational price spreads.  However, mild weather, coupled with significant demand reduction efforts by European consumers resulted in a 12% year-on-year decline in gas demand in Europe's key gas markets in Q1. Gas burn in the power market remained suppressed in Q1, down 15% year-on-year, although elevated coal and emissions pricing could present opportunities for fuel switching. As mentioned, with storage levels above the 5-year average this year, Europe is positioned well as it looks to replenish supplies ahead of the 2023, '24 winter season. While further reductions in Russian pipe gas remain a risk, much of this volume was already lost in the demand response last year.  Nevertheless, despite the European market's advantage position coming out of the second warmest winter on record. The shortfall in Russian supply should remain an ongoing challenge for the global balance until new supply is dispatched. Longer term, forecasts indicate European LNG imports will remain stable at elevated levels, despite net 0 rhetoric and policy induced pressure on the demand outlook for European gas. Leading LNG consultants predict that LNG demand in Europe will increase through the end of the decade before stabilizing above the 100 million-tonne level through 2040 and possibly beyond.  Let's now turn to Slide 10 to discuss Asia. Demand in Asia remained stable with overall LNG flows flat relative to Q1 last year and up 4% quarter-on-quarter. The demand decline observed over the last year in certain key Asian markets, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and China, to name a few, has narrowed considerably as spot prices continued to moderate this quarter. Demand response in these price-sensitive markets, especially with further moderation in prices, normalized weather and a pickup in economic activity will be a key determinant of market tightness in the medium term. As shown in the middle chart, Korea's imports were up 7% in Q1 due to nuclear maintenance, curtailed coal burn and LNG inventory replenishment. However, elevated storage levels and the expected start-up of a new 1.3 gigawatt nuclear plant in Q4 could impact spot buying from Korea in the upcoming months.  In Taiwan, imports rose 4% in Q1, driven by reduced coal-fired generation during the winter and the decommissioning of a nuclear reactor in March. Thailand also grew in parts 7% in Q1 in order to cover declines in both domestic output and pipeline imports for Myanmar. In contrast, LNG imports in Japan remained weak amid high inventory levels and improved nuclear availability year-on-year. Nevertheless, lower Japanese imports and reduced demand in China and India balance the gains in Korea and other parts of Asia.  In China, Q1 LNG imports were down 3% and or 0.5 million tonnes year-on-year, but we have observed some green shoots and leading indicators for demand growth as economic activity continues to pick up post lockdowns. With GDP expanding 4.5% year-on-year in the first quarter, China's gas demand grew 5.6% year-on-year in March and LNG imports rose 14% year-on-year in March, marking the first positive increase in over a year. A potential increase in industrial gas demand from a 56% month-on-month rise in new home sales could provide further tailwinds for LNG demand later this year.  Despite the recent weakness in Chinese LNG consumption, we believe China's long-term fundamentals remain strong, and the nation is on track to become the first 100 million-tonne LNG market before the end of the decade. China's significant investment in natural gas infrastructure from pipelines to regas terminals, to gas-fired power generation capacity, coupled with its active role in the long-term contracting market has demonstrated the region's commitment to natural gas as a long-term solution.  As we've discussed before, we expect the immense economic growth and energy evolution forecasted for the Asia region to underpin decades of growth in LNG demand driving the need for substantial investment in new liquefaction capacity. The over 20-year SPA we recently signed with an investment-grade Asian buyer that Jack mentioned, is linked to the SPL expansion project and further evidences the global need for long-term reliable gas supply. The SPL expansion project is a major source of prospective new LNG supply, and we look forward to building on this commercial momentum, developing the project according to our high standards and ultimately enhance Cheniere's capabilities to provide the market with reliable, flexible and cleaner burning LNG supply for decades to come.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Zach to review our financial results and guidance.\nZach Davis: Thanks, Anatol, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our first quarter 2023 results and key financial accomplishments and to update you on our upwardly revised outlook for the full year. Once again, the outstanding financial results we reported today are the product of our team's unwavering commitment to operational excellence, execution and financial discipline as we continue to create value for our stakeholders.  Turning to Slide 12. For the first quarter, we generated net income of approximately $5.4 billion, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $3.6 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $2.9 billion. As Jack mentioned, our first quarter results were aided by our marketing team's proactive selling forward of some of our first quarter open exposure starting last year at margins higher than current market margins as well as the contribution of 16 cargoes loaded at year-end 2022, but delivered in 2023. The majority of which were CMI spot cargoes and only 11 cargoes in transit at the end of Q1.  In addition, we benefited from a higher contribution from certain portfolio optimization activities from our IPM deals as well as vessel subchartering. These benefits were partially offset by a higher proportion of our volume being sold under long-term contracts and lower lifting margin due to lower Henry Hub prices compared to the first quarter last year. During the first quarter, we recognized an income 619 TBtu of physical LNG, all of which was produced at our 2 projects. Approximately 84% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SPA or IPM agreements with initial terms greater than 10 years.  As we've noted in prior earnings calls, our reported net income is impacted by the unrealized noncash derivative impacts to our revenue and cost of sales line items, which are primarily related to the mismatch of accounting methodology for the purchase of natural gas and the corresponding sale of LNG under our long-term IPM agreements. The further decline in sustained moderation and volatility of international gas price curves throughout the first quarter served to benefit the mark-to-market valuation of these agreements, driving a negative cost of sales number for the quarter and increasing our net income line item for the second quarter in a row.  Excluding the impact of $4.7 billion of total unrealized noncash derivatives, net income for the first quarter would still have been over $2 billion and cost of sales would have been around positive $3 billion instead of negative $1.5 billion. With today's results, we have earned cumulative net income of over $7.7 billion for the trailing 12 months. And have now reported positive net income on a quarterly and cumulative trailing 4-quarter basis 2 quarters in a row. Throughout the quarter, we continued to strategically pay down debt, prepaying approximately $900 million of consolidated long-term indebtedness and bringing our total debt pay down to approximately $7.5 billion since launching our original capital allocation plan in 2021.  As noted on our last call, in the first week of January, we redeemed the remaining almost $500 million of outstanding principal of the CCH notes due 2024. And throughout the quarter, we continued to utilize our open market repurchase program opportunistically repurchasing nearly $400 million in principal of outstanding CCH notes with maturities ranging from 2027 to 2039. These transactions represent some of the tools we have utilized to address our consolidated leverage and strengthen our balance sheet over the past few years. And these actions have been recognized by the rating agencies.  During the quarter, we received our second investment grade rating of BBB- at CEI from Fitch. And S&P upgraded SPL from BBB to BBB+ with a stable outlook. Thanks to our team's ability to deploy capital to address our leverage both opportunistically and efficiently we are officially investment-grade and index eligible across our corporate structure with our next debt maturity not until next year. After the achievement of IG across our corporate structure during the quarter, we have begun to shift our capital allocation weighting to our buyback program.  During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares for approximately $450 million as we continue to recalibrate our future cumulative debt paydown to share repurchase ratio from 4:1 to 1:1. As I mentioned on our last call, over the coming year or 2, there's likely a catch-up trade on the buyback since we were so aggressive on debt pay down late last year and into Q1 in order to get to investment grade throughout the complex. Our share repurchase program is designed to be flexible in order to take advantage of dislocations in the market like we saw at certain points these past couple of quarters. We will continue to target the 1:1 long-term ratio we introduced last fall as we deploy the remaining $3.2 billion under our current buyback authorization and an attempt to buy back over 10% of our market cap in the coming years.  We also declared our seventh quarterly dividend of $39.5 per common share for the first quarter last week. We intend to follow through with our previous guidance of growing our dividend by approximately 10% annually into the mid-2020s through construction of Stage 3 with the next step-up planned for later this year. And for the final pillar of our comprehensive capital allocation plan, disciplined growth, we funded approximately $550 million of CapEx at our Stage 3 project during the quarter with cash on hand. As Jack mentioned, construction is well underway, and we're tracking ahead of the schedule. Going forward, we will continue to fund Stage 3 CapEx efficiently with internally generated cash flow and the over $3 billion still available on our CCH term loan today.  As of March 31, we had over $10 billion of consolidated available liquidity even after the deployment of nearly $2 billion towards our capital allocation during the quarter. The financial strength afforded by our accelerated progress across all 4 pillars of our capital allocation plan, has become one of our key competitive advantages as we continue to procure and process over 7 Bcf of natural gas on a daily basis, deliver 45 million tonnes of LNG per year and develop further accretive brownfield growth at both our sites.  Turn now to Slide 13, where I will discuss our 2023 guidance and update you on our open capacity for the remainder of the year. Today, we are increasing our 2023 financial guidance by $200 million to $8.2 billion to $8.7 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA. And $5.7 billion to $6.2 billion in distributable cash flow. While we don't provide guidance by quarter, obviously, given the full year guidance, we are forecasting lower EBITDA across the second, third and fourth quarters compared to our first quarter results. The guidance increase is enabled primarily due to selling some of our open CMI cargoes opportunistically at higher margins than previously forecast.  The release of a couple of the origination placeholder cargoes to CMI to sell into the spot market, higher than originally forecast gas supply lifting margins and further contributions from optimizing our shipping portfolio. These increased guidance ranges continue to reflect current international gas price curves as well as our increasingly limited open position for the remainder of the year. Given the start of several long-term contracts this year and our planned maintenance at Sabine Pass this summer.  Currently, we have approximately 35 TBtu of unsold LNG remaining this year, 15 of which are reserved for long-term origination and we currently forecast that a $1 change in market margin would impact EBITDA by approximately $20 million for the balance of 2023. Highlighting how proactive the team has been in securing margin this year to guide 2023 EBITDA into the mid-8 billions. As always, our results could be impacted by the timing of certain year-end cargoes heading into 2024. Our distributable cash flow for 2023 could also be affected by any changes in the tax code under the IRA. However, the guidance provided today is based on the current IRA tax law guidance in which we do not qualify for the minimum corporate tax of 15% this year.  However, as noted previously, both of these dynamics would mainly affect timing and not materially impact our cumulative cash flow generation through the mid-2020s as we think about our overall capital allocation deployment. Despite our limited remaining open exposure this year and moderated international gas prices, our 2023 guidance ranges are well above the $5.7 billion high end of our 9-train run rate guidance, and we remain on track to achieve our 2020 vision of generating over $20 billion of available cash by 2026 and over $20 of DCF per share on a run rate basis. With every dollar deployed by our team, we are positioning Cheniere for a resilient and profitable future. And is the visibility of our future cash flows that enable us to meaningfully return capital to our stakeholders and pursue further disciplined growth through cycles while continuing to reliably and responsibly deliver affordable, cleaner burning energy to our customers worldwide.  That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to start off with the, I guess, the SBA contracting market out there. Good to see the contract for SPL expansion as you noted there. But just wanted to get a feeling of what you guys can share with regards to competitiveness. It seems like there's a number of players that are maybe a bit more aggressive in their attempt to get contracts at this point? And just wondering how you see the balance of maintaining your financial hurdles versus securing contracts for the expansion?\nJack Fusco: Yes, Jeremy, I believe it goes hand-in-hand with our exceptional operational performance. So the fact that we haven't missed a foundation customer cargo is not being unrecognized by the end user community worldwide community out there. To those folks that we've talked about in the past with the trillions of dollars being invested in natural gas infrastructure, want to make sure that they have gas to fill up that infrastructure. Those are the folks that we're targeting for our long-term contracts. We're not going to change our business model either. We're going to commercialize the new investments. We're going to lock in the price, the performance, the schedule with Bechtel and then we'll build the infrastructure.  But I'll turn it over to Anatol on what competition he sees in the SPA market today?\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Thanks, Jeremy. Well, as Jack said, over the last couple of years, it's become apparent to everyone the value proposition, as the guys said, built on our reliability and safety and performance. And we are -- we have never been and clearly aren't today in a race to the bottom for a commodity product, and we're very selective with whom we transact as Jack already mentioned, the end users, the counterparties that value that reliability, and we extract a premium for that, and we'll continue to do that in what is still a very competitive market, as you know. So we'll stick to our knitting and have this great base business meeting those financial objectives and expose ourselves to the upside as we outperform.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. And maybe just want to kind of level set results today versus your expectations, it clearly beat this street median by a big number, but the guidance didn't move up by the same number and just wondering, I think it's important. How did first quarter stack up versus your expectations and maybe the street wasn't shaping the timing of CMI being open across the year and that kind of led to some of the disconnect, but just to give any of your thoughts there?\nZach Davis: Jeremy, it's Zach. And I guess trying to compare a Bloomberg estimate for Q1 with our annual EBITDA guidance is like mixing apples and oranges because by the time we came out with guidance on the last call, which was late February, literally 2 months ago. I would say we're not off $1 billion from what we thought Q1 would be. If anything, Q1 was pretty baked by the end of February for us because going into the year, we locked in a significant amount of our open capacity with those margins well over $20 to create such a robust quarter in Q1.  So Q1 was always going to be weighted in terms of our EBITDA, and it's going to be in our guidance around 40% of the EBITDA for the year. And we knew that considering our open capacity or spot volumes for the year. 50% of them were going to be in Q1. Over 50% of our CMI contribution came in Q1. So I think some of the disconnect is basically a lot of folks may be spreading out more evenly, our EBITDA quarter-to-quarter. We did have a good amount of in-transit and we do make a bit more production in Q1. But basically, all of those 20-plus, 30-plus, even some 40-plus cargoes that we locked in, in the past year. Those were delivered in Q1 and created that outperformance.  And to say in the next last 2 months, we've been able to increase guidance again by $200 million after all of that accounted for on the last call. That's really a testament to the team here that we were able to secure a higher lifting margin upstream in the plants, took advantage of some of our length on our shipping portfolio by delivering more to Europe and subchartered a bit more. And then clearly, we still beat the market on some of the cargoes that we sold in the open market for Q2 and Q3 coming up for the rest of the year.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. I'll leave it there.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Brian Reynolds with UBS.\nBrian Reynolds: Maybe to follow up on the guidance question based off the quarterly outperformance. Zach, you did discuss the forward sale of cargoes subchartering and optimization. Just kind of curious if you could just break down how much the outperformance was maybe attributable to those components? And perhaps some of the pull forward on some of that optimization. And then in the context of the $200 million guidance raise, should we view that as a base business kind of positive outlook at this time?\nZach Davis: Yes, around the $200 million guidance rate, like we don't forecast in our EBITDA things that aren't locked in, realized at this point. So at this point, when we gave guidance that -- look, the open capacity is 35 TBtu and the $1 move is only $20 million. We're talking about 1% to 2% of our total production. We're talking about 2% of our annual EBITDA. And when this share price that we love to look at fluctuates with TTF for oil, we kind of scratch our heads when we are this locked in already going into the rest of the year.  So basically, I wouldn't assume anything is baked in, in terms of further upside from optimization, but in terms of subchartering, that's not -- that's locked in. It's either realized or the team has already sold those charters out and have locked in a profit for ourselves. So we feel real good about the new guidance range. And yes, there could be some upside, but we'll just have to see how things play out for the rest of the year.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. Really appreciate that incremental color. Maybe another question for you, Zach, on capital allocation. Cheniere bought back $450 million this quarter, but reduced another $400 million in debt. You talked about in your prepared remarks that there could be some more cash available for buybacks. Looking forward, how should we think about maybe debt retirement? What are your plans for paper perhaps this year and next, that could maybe impact that share buyback cadence of, call it, $750 to $1 billion quarterly assuming there was no debt pay down this quarter?\nZach Davis: Sure. I don't think I have ever said we're going to do $750 to $1 billion quarterly. What we have said is like, look, we have a $4 billion buyback program for 3 years. In the last 2 quarters alone, we bought back almost $1.2 billion. There's going to be even more robust allocation to buybacks, including this quarter and going forward. As we go through that $4 billion ideally within 3 years are well within 3 years. But the deployment is still going to fluctuate a bit. We are not dollar cost averaging on our buyback program. It's more opportunistic. So you can imagine we're active today on the buyback.  And then in terms of the debt paydown, we actually bought back in terms of debt, $900 million in Q1 but $500 million of that was in first week. I think people have to remember, we weren't actually officially investment grade and index eligible until early January. So we went into the year looking to finally finish that up, and we truly front-loaded late last year and early this year, the debt pay down to get there. But now that we're there, yes, there's a green light to go back the other way and reset that 1:1 cumulative ratio, meaning there's quite a bit of catch-up to do on the buybacks going forward, at least $2 billion through the rest of this year and into next.  So we're pretty optimistic in terms of the allocation to buybacks. And yes, over time, we'll get back to 1:1 and eventually buy back over 10% of the market cap.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. I appreciate all that incremental context.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Marc Solecitto with Barclays.\nMarc Solecitto: Maybe just to pick up on '23 guidance. Obviously, largely locked in at this point with 20 TBT remaining open. But I wonder if you could just talk about some of the factors that could put you at the upper or lower end of the revised range?\nZach Davis: Sure. So again, as I mentioned, with about $200 million worth of CMI contribution not locked in today, we're talking about, yes, like 2% of the EBITDA still floating out there. So what's the upside? There could be some upside from selling those cargoes at higher margins, depending on where markets settle through the rest of the year, even though our open capacity is definitely coming down. As I said before, half of our open capacity was in the first quarter. We have new contracts coming online this year that are starting up, and we also have the major maintenance turnaround at Sabine this summer.  So there's a few things there that just were always baked into our guidance in terms of having more open capacity earlier in the year. The other upside could be -- basically, we still have 15 TBtu reserve for long-term contracting. If those over time, are released to our short-term team, they'll be able to sell those at market prices, there could be a little upside there. And then on production, we're already estimating around 5 million tonnes per train and that's with the major maintenance embedded in all of that. So that's going to take some time to give you any update on production increases. Let's get through the major maintenance turnaround this summer. Let's get through the hurricane season. And we'll see where we are later this year on that, that could provide a little bit of upside.  And then lastly, we don't bake in any optimization, upstream or downstream of the plants that aren't already locked in. So we'll see how that flushes out through the year. So we feel real good that, at the very least, even with extreme pressures on margins for the rest of the year potentially in a hypothetical, we'll make our guidance. But besides that, we're in a good spot.\nMarc Solecitto: Got it. I appreciate all the color there. And then egas inventory levels obviously tracking above seasonal averages coming out of the winter. But with LNG price close energy equivalency parity with other fuel sources and green shoots of recovery and price-sensitive demand in both Europe and emerging markets. Curious how you see those factors interplay in terms of the LNG commodity price outlook over the summer?\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Thanks, Marc. This is Anatol. I mean we're watching the same things as you and Zach went through. We have relatively minimal exposure to those dynamics, but we learned from them. Obviously, our commitment is to supplying our long-term counterparties with our affordable, stable and environmentally attractive product and the amount of infrastructure that's being added today is just staggering. And the world is going to add over 120 million tonnes per annum of regas capacity just in Q1. Europe added over 13. China alone added over 13 and even though you're, of course, right that European storage is around the high watermark it's actually now slightly below where it was in 2020, not that we want to repeat of that.  But it just tells you that infrastructure should not be a constraint and as you mentioned, we're seeing green shoots of incremental tenders from the price-sensitive markets like India, in March, a very active Chinese market. Weak PMI for the last month, manufacturing PMI, but we're optimistic that the second half will show a meaningful turnaround. So we're optimistic. We think these price levels are great. Coal prices are still elevated, emissions prices are still elevated, as you mentioned. So we're -- we feel very good about the hand we're dealt.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Spiro Dounis with Citi.\nSpiro Dounis: First question, maybe for you, Zach, just starting with the Sabine Pass expansion. Still early days here, but I just wonder if you could just walk us through a little bit about the general plan to fund that expansion. I don't believe a lot of that CapEx was factored into the 2020 vision you all laid out in the fall. So just curious how should we be thinking about that funding relative to the capital allocation plan in place?\nZach Davis: Sure. So the 2020 Vision capital allocation plan really only goes through 2026. And in that, we still had billions of dollars for new developments. That was mainly the incremental mid-scale trains at Corpus, but there was still money above and beyond that, that is baked in, and we'll be spending some money to get ahead of that SBL expansion. But again, it's going to take a couple of years to get everything ready for FID and to officially start deploying meaningful money down at Sabine. And now that we have 6 trains fully up and running there. We have a base plus variable DPU policy. We're set up pretty well to live within cash flows there and continue to pay out at the very least, the base and have more than enough equity cash flow there to live within the cash flows.  And as we develop these projects and think about CapEx at, say, 6 to 7x unlevered returns, highly contracted at 10% and 50% leverage, which gets you to under 4x on a debt-to-EBITDA basis, it all pencils out just fine. So we'll be well placed for that. And I guess it will be in our next capital allocation plan where we're baking that in. It probably just won't be for the third September in a row this year.\nSpiro Dounis: Got it. That's good color. Second one, maybe for you, Anatol, you thinking about SPAs. I want to really kind of focus in on the tenor. You mentioned over 20 years on this recent SPA and over kind of caught my ear, just given that this is supplied it's really not starting up until closer to 2030. And so I'm just curious, is that a general trend you're kind of seeing across other commercial discussions are tenders actually increasing this time around? And then just curious sort of in that context, how much things like or features like carbon capture are playing a role in these discussions now versus maybe a year or 2 ago?\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Thanks, Spiro. We were never in the camp that the 20-year deal is dead. Obviously, over the last couple of years, the market has largely absorbed that. And you're seeing -- but that said, you're clearly seeing the average tenor over whatever period extending. So we're -- we've done some 15-year deals. We've done some well over 20-year deals over the last couple of years. And we like those transactions, again, especially when it is an end user and it is a building block to a relationship that we expect will last for decades and will lead to incremental volume.  The other component of your question, like since it is starting the sort of the 20-year piece, if you will, is starting in the back half of the decade, there are some early volumes incorporated into that as Zach mentioned, the -- in part, some of the volumes we reserve in the portfolio for that opportunity, and we're navigating that using the portfolio. So you kind of have a 20-year plus structure that we like and our kind of reliable customers like, and that's what we've done, a fair amount of in Asia and expect to do more.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Jean Salisbury with Bernstein.\nJean Salisbury: I just have one. I wanted to get your thoughts on the new DOE policy making it harder to get permit extensions if you're not under construction. How do you see this policy affecting the pace and size of the U.S. LNG build-out, if at all? And does that have any kind of secondary impact on Cheniere?\nJack Fusco: Hi, Jean Ann, thanks for the question. So I actually view the policy in a positive way that much like what we do today, which is we commercialize our projects before we fully go into construction or finance. They want to make sure that there's a need basis for what they've permitted. So I think it will help with some of the projects that have been on the books for a while that maybe they have allocated gas flows to that they help them -- help move them along. So some of these projects surpassed my time line here at Cheniere, which is 7 years. Have been on the books for over a decade. And it's quite frankly, it's time to either build a project or not. And so I view it relatively positively.  In fact, all the administration, whether it's DOE or FERC have started -- begun to embrace that natural gas is here to stay. It's going to be a very, very important transition fuel for clean energy and beyond, quite frankly. So we're starting to see some movement there on all the infrastructure projects.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Sean Morgan with Evercore.\nSean Morgan: Regarding the issue with the formaldehyde, I think you guys said that you tested 41 or 44 turbines to be compliant with the government standards. What's the plan for the remaining 3? And are there sort of CapEx ability to sort of remediate any problems you have, if there's anything outstanding?\nJack Fusco: No, the 3, the remaining reach on are just a matter of, I'll say, supply chain. So we're waiting for some parts from Baker Hughes. And when those parts get installed, during planned downtime, then we'll retest them. But it's our belief, and we've got enough data now that we are well within compliance. And as you know, this is not an issue at all at Corpus. It's only been at Sabine with the water injection. But it will be immaterial and you all want.\nSean Morgan: Okay. And then I think Zach might have mentioned something about eligibility now for the index. I assume the S&P 500. Have you guys met all of the criteria that's required for inclusion at this point?\nZach Davis: So the eligibility I was talking about was the investment-grade index eligibility. But in terms of your question, yes, we meet it, and we've met it now for 2 quarters in a row. Our LTM EBITDA -- net income is over $7 billion. Our market cap is large enough that we're probably in the top 5 largest companies in this country that qualify that are not in the S&P 500. So should be a matter of time, but obviously, had a partner.\nOperator: And the next question is from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: So I wanted to just had a market question. Q1 looks like most 80% of your cargoes went to Europe, which frankly, surprised at least me a little bit, given storage levels in Europe and China reopening. So I wonder if you could just talk to the dynamics there? And then how do you think the rest of the year plays out?\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Thanks, Mike. It's Anatol. Look, the pricing was more attractive in Europe than it was in Asia during Q1. And it's as simple as that. We obviously don't control the vast majority of the volume that we produce and our customers took advantage of the destination flexibility. And as did we, which, as Zach and Jack discussed had led to some chartering out of shipping lengths that we had penciled in for Asia, but ultimately did not materialize.  So just the benefit of this product at reliably goes to the market of highest netback most need. And we're seeing a very delicate balancing act today between Asia and Europe and things can shift on a dime. We always -- the May call is always tricky because you're sitting in the shoulder period, and that is a global dynamic before things really pick up mid-summer. So we expect that strength to materialize in Asia, kind of the hint in your question and the back half of the year, I would expect that the volumes tend to go to Asia more so than to Europe, given its recovery.\nMichael Blum: Okay. Great. And then just wondering if there's been any change in the tenor of discussions with Europe? I know politically, it's been more or less call it more challenging to sign long-term contracts. I wonder if there's been any change in that dynamic?\nAnatol Feygin: No. I mean the bottom line is that you'll see kind of similar dynamics that you saw last year, and you're absolutely right that most counterparts in Europe have a difficult time going beyond 15 years. Doesn't mean that those are transactions that we would not entertain. But as we've always said, we expect that the fundamental demand driver to be Asia, and we're seeing much more comfort with multi multi-decade commitments out of that theater than out of our European counterparties, but we expect to see some success in Europe as well.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.\nCraig Shere: First, Anatol, you commented as usual, about not competing for the lowest cost and historically, the last couple of quarters, I think, you pointed out that some at least partially contracted peers may not be able to reach FID due to financing, the competitive pricing of their offtake and other issues. Do you think at this point that there could be 5 or 10 MTPA plus of orphan downstream demand that may be looking for a home in the next year?\nAnatol Feygin: I mean the short answer is, yes, there are different types of counterparties that have contracted for projects that are unlikely to move forward and some of that demand is structural, and we would look to meet that. Other demand is opportunistic and that may not materialize. But we do think as the market shakes out, to your point, we did expect more than 2 FIDs in '22. And obviously, Q1 saw a number of FIDs here. We continue to expect more. But to the extent that some of these relatively well contracted projects at aggressive rates that are difficult to prosecute in the aggregate fall by the wayside, we do think that there is some fundamental demand that could be a good opportunity for us.\nCraig Shere: Great. That's helpful. And for my second one, now that we're starting to think about the end of the decade and beyond, I thought I had read that the DOE is looking to draw a hard line in the sand about the 7-year export authorization time lines of people haven't actually broken ground and gotten financing. And I'm wondering if there's a thought now that so much in total is authorized for export, though obviously not a good portion of it is not in the works at the moment. I wonder if there's a thought that by the end of the decade, the DOE may be more the governing factor than FERC and those are a little more reliable and consistent in their project development and time lines may have competitive advantages.\nJack Fusco: We haven't seen either agency being competitive to anything that we wanted to do ourselves. So look, I've been here for 7 years, and we have built how many tonnes and it's all in my 7 years.\nZach Davis: I did over 20.\nJack Fusco: Yes. FID-ed over 20 million tonnes. So it hasn't slowed us down. I don't think it will. I do think it'll help focus the regulators and the stakeholders on projects that are really going to move forward in a timely fashion. So think it's a positive, not a negative overall for the industry.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Sam Burwell with Jefferies.\nGeorge Burwell: I wanted to hit on CapEx quickly. A little over $700 million spent in 1Q, $550 million of that being CCL3, just curious if both of those are good estimates for like a quarterly run rate for the rest of the year? Or anything driving that higher in 1Q? And then with respect to CCL3 funding, I just wanted to confirm that the plan is still to lever that project 50% and what the factors driving the funding it from cash on the balance sheet now might be if that's a function of short-term rates or when we might expect it to be back leveraged?\nZach Davis: Sure. So on the CapEx for the year, the $550 million was more than a typical quarter. We had some milestones during the quarter, and that was deployed into Stage 3. But Stage 3, I think the CapEx for the year will be around, if not a little less than $1.5 billion. And all in, when you start adding in maintenance CapEx, you add in other growth CapEx, which is mainly just development or this early work and FEED work at the Sabine expansion and with mid-scale 8 and 9, we'll be well under $2 billion in total CapEx for the year.  In terms of funding the Stage 3, 50-50, that's still the intent. It's just right now when you think about $6 billion or so of DCF, you account for that CapEx, we're at $4 billion or so of free cash flow. Account for the debt pay down, the dividend. They're still well over $2 billion that could technically be allocated over time to the buyback program going into the end of this year and early next.  So we have plenty of money to actually fund the equity component first of Stage 3, retain the flexibility, retain the commitments from the banks that don't expire for another 6 years, save hundreds of millions of dollars on interest expense and keep on plugging away. And we'll see if we use that leverage to finish up Stage 3 or even to help us fund -- yes, the Corpus expansion thereafter. So we do intend to use that money. It's just flexibly there for us and pretty cheap to hold on to for the time being.\nOperator: And our last question will come from Alex Kania with Wolfe Research.\nAlexis Kania: Just a question, I guess, as we're looking in the back half of the decade with just upstream infrastructure. Just how do you feel like connecting gas pipeline situation is going to look for both Corpus Christi and I guess, looking even further out to Sabine Pass. Do you think the industry is kind of caught up with the expected demand that you're seeing? And does that have any implications about how you're thinking about investment?\nJack Fusco: No, I think look, Corpus has a little bit of a benefit over Sabine that it's in Texas, and it's close to the Permian, and you probably saw that the Permian just in 2022, went from 15?\nZach Davis: 13.5 to...\nJack Fusco: Yes, from 13.5 Bcf to 18.5 Bcf almost 19. So significant growth in natural gas coming out of the Permian, and we intend to take advantage of it. And you can you can build pipe in Texas these days. At Sabine it's going to be a little more complicated because we've never wanted to make ourselves overly dependent on 1 basin. So we're going to look for opportunities to tap into multiple basins to take care of the Sabine growth. But as you're seeing from FERC, things are moving. Projects are getting approved, and we're hopeful that we'll be able to move swiftly when the time is right.\nAlexis Kania: Great. And maybe just the last question is with respect to long-term contract against PAs, are you still getting a lot of interest on IPM sorts of frameworks rather than kind of the international offtakers as an option. Just I guess, apart from a couple -- in recent past, we haven't seen a lot of that type recently, but I'm curious if there's still appetite for that.\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. I guess in short, our forward book of business as we look at it very much rhymes with what we have done in recent history. So expect a healthy mix of IPM and delivered an FOB contracts. We like the diversity of that. We like a lot of aspects of IPM deals, the gas supply, the optimization opportunities. So expect to see us do more of that. But as we've always said, it is a relatively finite amount of counterparties that we can transact those with.\nJack Fusco: And thanks all of you for your support and your kind words and be safe out there. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have an excellent day.",

            "name": "Anatol Feygin",
            "content": "Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8. The LNG production in the first quarter reached new highs as global reliability improved with record monthly exports of 36 million tonnes in March. Following a period of outages across various plants worldwide, year-over-year increases in production were achieved in Norway, Australia and Qatar in particular. In Norway, the Hammerfest facility was offline in Q1 last year, and in Australia, Prelude was shut down after a loss of power in December 21 and did not restart until April of last year. And in Qatar, 2 megatrains were undergoing major planned maintenance in Q1 last year.  Exports from the U.S. were broadly flat year-over-year as Freeport LNG restarted production in February after having been offline since June of last year. While the uptick in global LNG production over the past few months has helped to balance the market and further stabilize price levels throughout the first quarter, we expect limited overall supply growth this year as few new projects are scheduled to come online in the next 18 months.  Until then, we expect supply and demand to remain precariously balanced and sensitive to supply disruptions, weather and demand shocks. We remain optimistic that the U.S. will continue to be a critical source of flexible supply in the market. U.S. flows to Europe continued to remain strong in Q1, helping ease market pressures and contributing to moderating prices. In fact, approximately 80% of cargoes produced by our 2 sites were delivered to Europe in the first quarter. The TTF monthly settlement prices averaged approximately $19.50 per MMBtu in the first quarter of '23, 35% lower year-on-year. Similarly, the JKM average settlement price decreased by 16% year-on-year to an average of approximately $26 per MMBtu. While both pricing indices are markedly lower than last year, global gas benchmarks remain at elevated levels. Q1 marked an inflection point for average quarterly global gas prices as JKM surpassed TTF for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine last year.  Cheniere's value proposition built on market-leading reliability is, of course, further enhanced by a stable and affordable commodity. In the U.S., in March, the Henry Hub front month contract price fell below $2 in MMBtu for the first time since September of 2020. Henry Hub averaged approximately $3.40 in Q1, and the front month contract is now trading in the mid $2 per MMBtu. Following the elevated pricing in North American gas markets last year, our production response led to a more normalized pricing environment, underscoring the abundance and relative affordability of Gulf Coast LNG.  Now let's turn to Slide 9 to address current European dynamics in some more detail. Europe has closed out this winter with gas inventories at or near the high end of its 5-year range, thanks in part to record mild weather and, of course, sustained LNG flows. LNG imports remained robust, increasing 8% year-over-year despite labor strike activity affecting several French terminals in March. U.S. exports to Europe increased approximately 4% year-on-year in Q1 and about 15% quarter-over-quarter. The addition of 5 FSRUs over the past few months across the Netherlands, Germany and Finland, helped increase LNG import capacity and reduce locational price spreads.  However, mild weather, coupled with significant demand reduction efforts by European consumers resulted in a 12% year-on-year decline in gas demand in Europe's key gas markets in Q1. Gas burn in the power market remained suppressed in Q1, down 15% year-on-year, although elevated coal and emissions pricing could present opportunities for fuel switching. As mentioned, with storage levels above the 5-year average this year, Europe is positioned well as it looks to replenish supplies ahead of the 2023, '24 winter season. While further reductions in Russian pipe gas remain a risk, much of this volume was already lost in the demand response last year.  Nevertheless, despite the European market's advantage position coming out of the second warmest winter on record. The shortfall in Russian supply should remain an ongoing challenge for the global balance until new supply is dispatched. Longer term, forecasts indicate European LNG imports will remain stable at elevated levels, despite net 0 rhetoric and policy induced pressure on the demand outlook for European gas. Leading LNG consultants predict that LNG demand in Europe will increase through the end of the decade before stabilizing above the 100 million-tonne level through 2040 and possibly beyond.  Let's now turn to Slide 10 to discuss Asia. Demand in Asia remained stable with overall LNG flows flat relative to Q1 last year and up 4% quarter-on-quarter. The demand decline observed over the last year in certain key Asian markets, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and China, to name a few, has narrowed considerably as spot prices continued to moderate this quarter. Demand response in these price-sensitive markets, especially with further moderation in prices, normalized weather and a pickup in economic activity will be a key determinant of market tightness in the medium term. As shown in the middle chart, Korea's imports were up 7% in Q1 due to nuclear maintenance, curtailed coal burn and LNG inventory replenishment. However, elevated storage levels and the expected start-up of a new 1.3 gigawatt nuclear plant in Q4 could impact spot buying from Korea in the upcoming months.  In Taiwan, imports rose 4% in Q1, driven by reduced coal-fired generation during the winter and the decommissioning of a nuclear reactor in March. Thailand also grew in parts 7% in Q1 in order to cover declines in both domestic output and pipeline imports for Myanmar. In contrast, LNG imports in Japan remained weak amid high inventory levels and improved nuclear availability year-on-year. Nevertheless, lower Japanese imports and reduced demand in China and India balance the gains in Korea and other parts of Asia.  In China, Q1 LNG imports were down 3% and or 0.5 million tonnes year-on-year, but we have observed some green shoots and leading indicators for demand growth as economic activity continues to pick up post lockdowns. With GDP expanding 4.5% year-on-year in the first quarter, China's gas demand grew 5.6% year-on-year in March and LNG imports rose 14% year-on-year in March, marking the first positive increase in over a year. A potential increase in industrial gas demand from a 56% month-on-month rise in new home sales could provide further tailwinds for LNG demand later this year.  Despite the recent weakness in Chinese LNG consumption, we believe China's long-term fundamentals remain strong, and the nation is on track to become the first 100 million-tonne LNG market before the end of the decade. China's significant investment in natural gas infrastructure from pipelines to regas terminals, to gas-fired power generation capacity, coupled with its active role in the long-term contracting market has demonstrated the region's commitment to natural gas as a long-term solution.  As we've discussed before, we expect the immense economic growth and energy evolution forecasted for the Asia region to underpin decades of growth in LNG demand driving the need for substantial investment in new liquefaction capacity. The over 20-year SPA we recently signed with an investment-grade Asian buyer that Jack mentioned, is linked to the SPL expansion project and further evidences the global need for long-term reliable gas supply. The SPL expansion project is a major source of prospective new LNG supply, and we look forward to building on this commercial momentum, developing the project according to our high standards and ultimately enhance Cheniere's capabilities to provide the market with reliable, flexible and cleaner burning LNG supply for decades to come.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Zach to review our financial results and guidance. Yes. Thanks, Jeremy. Well, as Jack said, over the last couple of years, it's become apparent to everyone the value proposition, as the guys said, built on our reliability and safety and performance. And we are -- we have never been and clearly aren't today in a race to the bottom for a commodity product, and we're very selective with whom we transact as Jack already mentioned, the end users, the counterparties that value that reliability, and we extract a premium for that, and we'll continue to do that in what is still a very competitive market, as you know. So we'll stick to our knitting and have this great base business meeting those financial objectives and expose ourselves to the upside as we outperform. Yes. Thanks, Marc. This is Anatol. I mean we're watching the same things as you and Zach went through. We have relatively minimal exposure to those dynamics, but we learned from them. Obviously, our commitment is to supplying our long-term counterparties with our affordable, stable and environmentally attractive product and the amount of infrastructure that's being added today is just staggering. And the world is going to add over 120 million tonnes per annum of regas capacity just in Q1. Europe added over 13. China alone added over 13 and even though you're, of course, right that European storage is around the high watermark it's actually now slightly below where it was in 2020, not that we want to repeat of that.  But it just tells you that infrastructure should not be a constraint and as you mentioned, we're seeing green shoots of incremental tenders from the price-sensitive markets like India, in March, a very active Chinese market. Weak PMI for the last month, manufacturing PMI, but we're optimistic that the second half will show a meaningful turnaround. So we're optimistic. We think these price levels are great. Coal prices are still elevated, emissions prices are still elevated, as you mentioned. So we're -- we feel very good about the hand we're dealt. Yes. Thanks, Spiro. We were never in the camp that the 20-year deal is dead. Obviously, over the last couple of years, the market has largely absorbed that. And you're seeing -- but that said, you're clearly seeing the average tenor over whatever period extending. So we're -- we've done some 15-year deals. We've done some well over 20-year deals over the last couple of years. And we like those transactions, again, especially when it is an end user and it is a building block to a relationship that we expect will last for decades and will lead to incremental volume.  The other component of your question, like since it is starting the sort of the 20-year piece, if you will, is starting in the back half of the decade, there are some early volumes incorporated into that as Zach mentioned, the -- in part, some of the volumes we reserve in the portfolio for that opportunity, and we're navigating that using the portfolio. So you kind of have a 20-year plus structure that we like and our kind of reliable customers like, and that's what we've done, a fair amount of in Asia and expect to do more. Yes. Thanks, Mike. It's Anatol. Look, the pricing was more attractive in Europe than it was in Asia during Q1. And it's as simple as that. We obviously don't control the vast majority of the volume that we produce and our customers took advantage of the destination flexibility. And as did we, which, as Zach and Jack discussed had led to some chartering out of shipping lengths that we had penciled in for Asia, but ultimately did not materialize.  So just the benefit of this product at reliably goes to the market of highest netback most need. And we're seeing a very delicate balancing act today between Asia and Europe and things can shift on a dime. We always -- the May call is always tricky because you're sitting in the shoulder period, and that is a global dynamic before things really pick up mid-summer. So we expect that strength to materialize in Asia, kind of the hint in your question and the back half of the year, I would expect that the volumes tend to go to Asia more so than to Europe, given its recovery. No. I mean the bottom line is that you'll see kind of similar dynamics that you saw last year, and you're absolutely right that most counterparts in Europe have a difficult time going beyond 15 years. Doesn't mean that those are transactions that we would not entertain. But as we've always said, we expect that the fundamental demand driver to be Asia, and we're seeing much more comfort with multi multi-decade commitments out of that theater than out of our European counterparties, but we expect to see some success in Europe as well. I mean the short answer is, yes, there are different types of counterparties that have contracted for projects that are unlikely to move forward and some of that demand is structural, and we would look to meet that. Other demand is opportunistic and that may not materialize. But we do think as the market shakes out, to your point, we did expect more than 2 FIDs in '22. And obviously, Q1 saw a number of FIDs here. We continue to expect more. But to the extent that some of these relatively well contracted projects at aggressive rates that are difficult to prosecute in the aggregate fall by the wayside, we do think that there is some fundamental demand that could be a good opportunity for us. Yes. I guess in short, our forward book of business as we look at it very much rhymes with what we have done in recent history. So expect a healthy mix of IPM and delivered an FOB contracts. We like the diversity of that. We like a lot of aspects of IPM deals, the gas supply, the optimization opportunities. So expect to see us do more of that. But as we've always said, it is a relatively finite amount of counterparties that we can transact those with."

            "name": "Jack Fusco",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning as we review our first quarter results and improve 2023 outlook. As you can see from the results, we have continued our exceptional performance from 2022 and our improved outlook for the rest of this year is reflected in our increased guidance ranges. The first quarter was highlighted by excellent performance across Cheniere's platform from operations to project execution to capital allocation and origination.  While we are not yet able to share specific details, last week, we executed a new long-term SPA with an investment-grade Asian end user that is linked to the SPL expansion project. This is an exciting signal that we are already gaining early commercial momentum on our recently announced expansion plans at Sabine Pass. We look forward to providing more detail on this SPA in the near future.  Please turn to Slide 5, where I'll review key operational and financial highlights from the first quarter 2023, and introduce our upwardly revised annual financial guidance. We generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $3.6 billion in the first quarter and distributable cash flow of nearly $3 billion. The first quarter benefited from a number of discrete factors which drove EBITDA and DCF higher, which Zach will address in a few minutes.  During the first quarter, Zach and his team continued to make excellent progress on our capital allocation plan. We paid down nearly $900 million of debt and solidified investment-grade ratings across the Cheniere complex as we discussed on this past February call. We bought back over 3 million shares for about $450 million and paid our quarterly dividend of $39.5.  So in total, almost $1.5 billion in capital return during the quarter, plus another approximately $550 million invested as Stage 3 for our future growth. Operationally, in the first quarter, we picked up right where we left off last year. Further reinforcing Cheniere status as a leading global operator, reliably producing LNG with safety at the foundation of every action we take. We set a new quarterly record exporting 167 cargoes of LNG in the first quarter, surpassing our prior record, which was set in the fourth quarter of last year.  Looking ahead to the balance of 2023, as I mentioned before, our forecast has improved. We are raising full year guidance by $200 million on both EBITDA and distributable cash flow. Our new ranges are $8.2 billion to $8.7 billion in EBITDA and $5.7 billion to $6.2 billion in DCF. The increase is mainly driven by the team capturing and locking in higher margins, both upstream and downstream of our facility. Zach will provide more color on the increase and preemptively answer your questions on guidance in a few minutes.  Turn now to Slide 6, where I will update you on the status of our expansion projects, Corpus Christi Stage 3, which is under construction, Corpus Christi mid-scale trains 8 and 9, which is now in the FERC process and SPL expansion, which is in the prefiling with FERC. First, on Corpus Christi Stage 3. Destructions ramping up as its head count on the site, which is now approximately 750 workers, and we expect this to grow rapidly as we begin to transform from site preparation and groundwork into mechanical works over the coming months. Over 7,000 piles have been driven and soil stabilization is effectively complete. The foundations are beginning to be poured. Piping and spools have begun to arrive, and we expect to receive the first coal box at site next month, and its installation is an important construction milestone for Stage 3.  Overall, EPC progress is currently 28.7%, which is well ahead of plan. While construction is only 3.4% complete, early construction activities are already tracking ahead of schedule, increasing my confidence in schedule outperformance and potentially having more volumes in 2025 and possibly the entire 7 Train project being completed by the end of 2026, months ahead of the guaranteed schedule.  Next, on Corpus Christi, mid-scale trains 8 and 9, in line with what we told you last year when we prefiled this project. We submitted a full application to FERC on trains 8 and 9 in late March. We are optimistic about the permitting process for this project, given its distinct advantages of being identical to Stage 3 trains, being fully commercialized with creditworthy counterparties and not requiring significant supporting infrastructure. And the synergy of Bechtel already being mobilized on the site. We look forward to working with FERC and all relevant stakeholder agencies and regulators on a smooth and transparent review process.  Moving on to the Sabine Pass expansion project, which we revealed on our call back in February. I'm extremely excited about developing this major 20 million-tonne expansion, which has the ability to leverage our massive infrastructure position at Sabine Pass for economically advantaged incremental capacity. We have submitted the prefiling documents to FERC. We recently signed a contract with Bechtel for the FEED work related to this large-scale project, including for the carbon capture component. Commercially, the project is already gaining traction. As I highlighted earlier, last week, we're executing SPA of approximately 0.4 million tonnes per annum for over 20 years with an investment-grade Asian end user for LNG volumes delivered through 2047.  Most of the volumes associated with the SPA are subject to FID of Train 1 of the Sabine Pass expansion project. We are excited to have already signed an SPA linked to the project and to be building commercial momentum as we progress development. We progressed these project developments in an environment marked by cost inflation, rising interest rates and extremely competitive LNG markets. These realities not only underscore the importance of Cheniere's competitive advantages but also our resolute commitment to the investment parameters that guide our disciplined approach to capital investment.  As you have heard me say before, we are not in the FID business. Our focus is on long-term value creation, we are developing these projects with the same discipline, rigor and high standards that form the foundation of our existing infrastructure platform. We are extremely excited about our organic growth prospects, and we continue to target market-leading project returns on a risk-adjusted basis that our investors and stakeholders have come to expect from Cheniere. Thank you all again for your continued support of Cheniere.  I will now turn the call over to Anatol, who will provide an update on the LNG market. Yes, Jeremy, I believe it goes hand-in-hand with our exceptional operational performance. So the fact that we haven't missed a foundation customer cargo is not being unrecognized by the end user community worldwide community out there. To those folks that we've talked about in the past with the trillions of dollars being invested in natural gas infrastructure, want to make sure that they have gas to fill up that infrastructure. Those are the folks that we're targeting for our long-term contracts. We're not going to change our business model either. We're going to commercialize the new investments. We're going to lock in the price, the performance, the schedule with Bechtel and then we'll build the infrastructure.  But I'll turn it over to Anatol on what competition he sees in the SPA market today? Hi, Jean Ann, thanks for the question. So I actually view the policy in a positive way that much like what we do today, which is we commercialize our projects before we fully go into construction or finance. They want to make sure that there's a need basis for what they've permitted. So I think it will help with some of the projects that have been on the books for a while that maybe they have allocated gas flows to that they help them -- help move them along. So some of these projects surpassed my time line here at Cheniere, which is 7 years. Have been on the books for over a decade. And it's quite frankly, it's time to either build a project or not. And so I view it relatively positively.  In fact, all the administration, whether it's DOE or FERC have started -- begun to embrace that natural gas is here to stay. It's going to be a very, very important transition fuel for clean energy and beyond, quite frankly. So we're starting to see some movement there on all the infrastructure projects. No, the 3, the remaining reach on are just a matter of, I'll say, supply chain. So we're waiting for some parts from Baker Hughes. And when those parts get installed, during planned downtime, then we'll retest them. But it's our belief, and we've got enough data now that we are well within compliance. And as you know, this is not an issue at all at Corpus. It's only been at Sabine with the water injection. But it will be immaterial and you all want. We haven't seen either agency being competitive to anything that we wanted to do ourselves. So look, I've been here for 7 years, and we have built how many tonnes and it's all in my 7 years. Yes. FID-ed over 20 million tonnes. So it hasn't slowed us down. I don't think it will. I do think it'll help focus the regulators and the stakeholders on projects that are really going to move forward in a timely fashion. So think it's a positive, not a negative overall for the industry. No, I think look, Corpus has a little bit of a benefit over Sabine that it's in Texas, and it's close to the Permian, and you probably saw that the Permian just in 2022, went from 15? Yes, from 13.5 Bcf to 18.5 Bcf almost 19. So significant growth in natural gas coming out of the Permian, and we intend to take advantage of it. And you can you can build pipe in Texas these days. At Sabine it's going to be a little more complicated because we've never wanted to make ourselves overly dependent on 1 basin. So we're going to look for opportunities to tap into multiple basins to take care of the Sabine growth. But as you're seeing from FERC, things are moving. Projects are getting approved, and we're hopeful that we'll be able to move swiftly when the time is right. And thanks all of you for your support and your kind words and be safe out there. Thank you."

            "name": "Zach Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Anatol, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our first quarter 2023 results and key financial accomplishments and to update you on our upwardly revised outlook for the full year. Once again, the outstanding financial results we reported today are the product of our team's unwavering commitment to operational excellence, execution and financial discipline as we continue to create value for our stakeholders.  Turning to Slide 12. For the first quarter, we generated net income of approximately $5.4 billion, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $3.6 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $2.9 billion. As Jack mentioned, our first quarter results were aided by our marketing team's proactive selling forward of some of our first quarter open exposure starting last year at margins higher than current market margins as well as the contribution of 16 cargoes loaded at year-end 2022, but delivered in 2023. The majority of which were CMI spot cargoes and only 11 cargoes in transit at the end of Q1.  In addition, we benefited from a higher contribution from certain portfolio optimization activities from our IPM deals as well as vessel subchartering. These benefits were partially offset by a higher proportion of our volume being sold under long-term contracts and lower lifting margin due to lower Henry Hub prices compared to the first quarter last year. During the first quarter, we recognized an income 619 TBtu of physical LNG, all of which was produced at our 2 projects. Approximately 84% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SPA or IPM agreements with initial terms greater than 10 years.  As we've noted in prior earnings calls, our reported net income is impacted by the unrealized noncash derivative impacts to our revenue and cost of sales line items, which are primarily related to the mismatch of accounting methodology for the purchase of natural gas and the corresponding sale of LNG under our long-term IPM agreements. The further decline in sustained moderation and volatility of international gas price curves throughout the first quarter served to benefit the mark-to-market valuation of these agreements, driving a negative cost of sales number for the quarter and increasing our net income line item for the second quarter in a row.  Excluding the impact of $4.7 billion of total unrealized noncash derivatives, net income for the first quarter would still have been over $2 billion and cost of sales would have been around positive $3 billion instead of negative $1.5 billion. With today's results, we have earned cumulative net income of over $7.7 billion for the trailing 12 months. And have now reported positive net income on a quarterly and cumulative trailing 4-quarter basis 2 quarters in a row. Throughout the quarter, we continued to strategically pay down debt, prepaying approximately $900 million of consolidated long-term indebtedness and bringing our total debt pay down to approximately $7.5 billion since launching our original capital allocation plan in 2021.  As noted on our last call, in the first week of January, we redeemed the remaining almost $500 million of outstanding principal of the CCH notes due 2024. And throughout the quarter, we continued to utilize our open market repurchase program opportunistically repurchasing nearly $400 million in principal of outstanding CCH notes with maturities ranging from 2027 to 2039. These transactions represent some of the tools we have utilized to address our consolidated leverage and strengthen our balance sheet over the past few years. And these actions have been recognized by the rating agencies.  During the quarter, we received our second investment grade rating of BBB- at CEI from Fitch. And S&P upgraded SPL from BBB to BBB+ with a stable outlook. Thanks to our team's ability to deploy capital to address our leverage both opportunistically and efficiently we are officially investment-grade and index eligible across our corporate structure with our next debt maturity not until next year. After the achievement of IG across our corporate structure during the quarter, we have begun to shift our capital allocation weighting to our buyback program.  During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares for approximately $450 million as we continue to recalibrate our future cumulative debt paydown to share repurchase ratio from 4:1 to 1:1. As I mentioned on our last call, over the coming year or 2, there's likely a catch-up trade on the buyback since we were so aggressive on debt pay down late last year and into Q1 in order to get to investment grade throughout the complex. Our share repurchase program is designed to be flexible in order to take advantage of dislocations in the market like we saw at certain points these past couple of quarters. We will continue to target the 1:1 long-term ratio we introduced last fall as we deploy the remaining $3.2 billion under our current buyback authorization and an attempt to buy back over 10% of our market cap in the coming years.  We also declared our seventh quarterly dividend of $39.5 per common share for the first quarter last week. We intend to follow through with our previous guidance of growing our dividend by approximately 10% annually into the mid-2020s through construction of Stage 3 with the next step-up planned for later this year. And for the final pillar of our comprehensive capital allocation plan, disciplined growth, we funded approximately $550 million of CapEx at our Stage 3 project during the quarter with cash on hand. As Jack mentioned, construction is well underway, and we're tracking ahead of the schedule. Going forward, we will continue to fund Stage 3 CapEx efficiently with internally generated cash flow and the over $3 billion still available on our CCH term loan today.  As of March 31, we had over $10 billion of consolidated available liquidity even after the deployment of nearly $2 billion towards our capital allocation during the quarter. The financial strength afforded by our accelerated progress across all 4 pillars of our capital allocation plan, has become one of our key competitive advantages as we continue to procure and process over 7 Bcf of natural gas on a daily basis, deliver 45 million tonnes of LNG per year and develop further accretive brownfield growth at both our sites.  Turn now to Slide 13, where I will discuss our 2023 guidance and update you on our open capacity for the remainder of the year. Today, we are increasing our 2023 financial guidance by $200 million to $8.2 billion to $8.7 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA. And $5.7 billion to $6.2 billion in distributable cash flow. While we don't provide guidance by quarter, obviously, given the full year guidance, we are forecasting lower EBITDA across the second, third and fourth quarters compared to our first quarter results. The guidance increase is enabled primarily due to selling some of our open CMI cargoes opportunistically at higher margins than previously forecast.  The release of a couple of the origination placeholder cargoes to CMI to sell into the spot market, higher than originally forecast gas supply lifting margins and further contributions from optimizing our shipping portfolio. These increased guidance ranges continue to reflect current international gas price curves as well as our increasingly limited open position for the remainder of the year. Given the start of several long-term contracts this year and our planned maintenance at Sabine Pass this summer.  Currently, we have approximately 35 TBtu of unsold LNG remaining this year, 15 of which are reserved for long-term origination and we currently forecast that a $1 change in market margin would impact EBITDA by approximately $20 million for the balance of 2023. Highlighting how proactive the team has been in securing margin this year to guide 2023 EBITDA into the mid-8 billions. As always, our results could be impacted by the timing of certain year-end cargoes heading into 2024. Our distributable cash flow for 2023 could also be affected by any changes in the tax code under the IRA. However, the guidance provided today is based on the current IRA tax law guidance in which we do not qualify for the minimum corporate tax of 15% this year.  However, as noted previously, both of these dynamics would mainly affect timing and not materially impact our cumulative cash flow generation through the mid-2020s as we think about our overall capital allocation deployment. Despite our limited remaining open exposure this year and moderated international gas prices, our 2023 guidance ranges are well above the $5.7 billion high end of our 9-train run rate guidance, and we remain on track to achieve our 2020 vision of generating over $20 billion of available cash by 2026 and over $20 of DCF per share on a run rate basis. With every dollar deployed by our team, we are positioning Cheniere for a resilient and profitable future. And is the visibility of our future cash flows that enable us to meaningfully return capital to our stakeholders and pursue further disciplined growth through cycles while continuing to reliably and responsibly deliver affordable, cleaner burning energy to our customers worldwide.  That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions. Jeremy, it's Zach. And I guess trying to compare a Bloomberg estimate for Q1 with our annual EBITDA guidance is like mixing apples and oranges because by the time we came out with guidance on the last call, which was late February, literally 2 months ago. I would say we're not off $1 billion from what we thought Q1 would be. If anything, Q1 was pretty baked by the end of February for us because going into the year, we locked in a significant amount of our open capacity with those margins well over $20 to create such a robust quarter in Q1.  So Q1 was always going to be weighted in terms of our EBITDA, and it's going to be in our guidance around 40% of the EBITDA for the year. And we knew that considering our open capacity or spot volumes for the year. 50% of them were going to be in Q1. Over 50% of our CMI contribution came in Q1. So I think some of the disconnect is basically a lot of folks may be spreading out more evenly, our EBITDA quarter-to-quarter. We did have a good amount of in-transit and we do make a bit more production in Q1. But basically, all of those 20-plus, 30-plus, even some 40-plus cargoes that we locked in, in the past year. Those were delivered in Q1 and created that outperformance.  And to say in the next last 2 months, we've been able to increase guidance again by $200 million after all of that accounted for on the last call. That's really a testament to the team here that we were able to secure a higher lifting margin upstream in the plants, took advantage of some of our length on our shipping portfolio by delivering more to Europe and subchartered a bit more. And then clearly, we still beat the market on some of the cargoes that we sold in the open market for Q2 and Q3 coming up for the rest of the year. Yes, around the $200 million guidance rate, like we don't forecast in our EBITDA things that aren't locked in, realized at this point. So at this point, when we gave guidance that -- look, the open capacity is 35 TBtu and the $1 move is only $20 million. We're talking about 1% to 2% of our total production. We're talking about 2% of our annual EBITDA. And when this share price that we love to look at fluctuates with TTF for oil, we kind of scratch our heads when we are this locked in already going into the rest of the year.  So basically, I wouldn't assume anything is baked in, in terms of further upside from optimization, but in terms of subchartering, that's not -- that's locked in. It's either realized or the team has already sold those charters out and have locked in a profit for ourselves. So we feel real good about the new guidance range. And yes, there could be some upside, but we'll just have to see how things play out for the rest of the year. Sure. I don't think I have ever said we're going to do $750 to $1 billion quarterly. What we have said is like, look, we have a $4 billion buyback program for 3 years. In the last 2 quarters alone, we bought back almost $1.2 billion. There's going to be even more robust allocation to buybacks, including this quarter and going forward. As we go through that $4 billion ideally within 3 years are well within 3 years. But the deployment is still going to fluctuate a bit. We are not dollar cost averaging on our buyback program. It's more opportunistic. So you can imagine we're active today on the buyback.  And then in terms of the debt paydown, we actually bought back in terms of debt, $900 million in Q1 but $500 million of that was in first week. I think people have to remember, we weren't actually officially investment grade and index eligible until early January. So we went into the year looking to finally finish that up, and we truly front-loaded late last year and early this year, the debt pay down to get there. But now that we're there, yes, there's a green light to go back the other way and reset that 1:1 cumulative ratio, meaning there's quite a bit of catch-up to do on the buybacks going forward, at least $2 billion through the rest of this year and into next.  So we're pretty optimistic in terms of the allocation to buybacks. And yes, over time, we'll get back to 1:1 and eventually buy back over 10% of the market cap. Sure. So again, as I mentioned, with about $200 million worth of CMI contribution not locked in today, we're talking about, yes, like 2% of the EBITDA still floating out there. So what's the upside? There could be some upside from selling those cargoes at higher margins, depending on where markets settle through the rest of the year, even though our open capacity is definitely coming down. As I said before, half of our open capacity was in the first quarter. We have new contracts coming online this year that are starting up, and we also have the major maintenance turnaround at Sabine this summer.  So there's a few things there that just were always baked into our guidance in terms of having more open capacity earlier in the year. The other upside could be -- basically, we still have 15 TBtu reserve for long-term contracting. If those over time, are released to our short-term team, they'll be able to sell those at market prices, there could be a little upside there. And then on production, we're already estimating around 5 million tonnes per train and that's with the major maintenance embedded in all of that. So that's going to take some time to give you any update on production increases. Let's get through the major maintenance turnaround this summer. Let's get through the hurricane season. And we'll see where we are later this year on that, that could provide a little bit of upside.  And then lastly, we don't bake in any optimization, upstream or downstream of the plants that aren't already locked in. So we'll see how that flushes out through the year. So we feel real good that, at the very least, even with extreme pressures on margins for the rest of the year potentially in a hypothetical, we'll make our guidance. But besides that, we're in a good spot. Sure. So the 2020 Vision capital allocation plan really only goes through 2026. And in that, we still had billions of dollars for new developments. That was mainly the incremental mid-scale trains at Corpus, but there was still money above and beyond that, that is baked in, and we'll be spending some money to get ahead of that SBL expansion. But again, it's going to take a couple of years to get everything ready for FID and to officially start deploying meaningful money down at Sabine. And now that we have 6 trains fully up and running there. We have a base plus variable DPU policy. We're set up pretty well to live within cash flows there and continue to pay out at the very least, the base and have more than enough equity cash flow there to live within the cash flows.  And as we develop these projects and think about CapEx at, say, 6 to 7x unlevered returns, highly contracted at 10% and 50% leverage, which gets you to under 4x on a debt-to-EBITDA basis, it all pencils out just fine. So we'll be well placed for that. And I guess it will be in our next capital allocation plan where we're baking that in. It probably just won't be for the third September in a row this year. So the eligibility I was talking about was the investment-grade index eligibility. But in terms of your question, yes, we meet it, and we've met it now for 2 quarters in a row. Our LTM EBITDA -- net income is over $7 billion. Our market cap is large enough that we're probably in the top 5 largest companies in this country that qualify that are not in the S&P 500. So should be a matter of time, but obviously, had a partner. I did over 20. Sure. So on the CapEx for the year, the $550 million was more than a typical quarter. We had some milestones during the quarter, and that was deployed into Stage 3. But Stage 3, I think the CapEx for the year will be around, if not a little less than $1.5 billion. And all in, when you start adding in maintenance CapEx, you add in other growth CapEx, which is mainly just development or this early work and FEED work at the Sabine expansion and with mid-scale 8 and 9, we'll be well under $2 billion in total CapEx for the year.  In terms of funding the Stage 3, 50-50, that's still the intent. It's just right now when you think about $6 billion or so of DCF, you account for that CapEx, we're at $4 billion or so of free cash flow. Account for the debt pay down, the dividend. They're still well over $2 billion that could technically be allocated over time to the buyback program going into the end of this year and early next.  So we have plenty of money to actually fund the equity component first of Stage 3, retain the flexibility, retain the commitments from the banks that don't expire for another 6 years, save hundreds of millions of dollars on interest expense and keep on plugging away. And we'll see if we use that leverage to finish up Stage 3 or even to help us fund -- yes, the Corpus expansion thereafter. So we do intend to use that money. It's just flexibly there for us and pretty cheap to hold on to for the time being. 13.5 to..."

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Randy Bhatia, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nRandy Bhatia: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Cheniere's third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. The slide presentation and access to the webcast for today's call are available at cheniere.com. Joining me this morning are Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO; Anatol Feygin, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Zach Davis, Executive Vice President and CFO. Before we begin, I would like to remind all listeners that, our remarks, including answers to your questions, may contain forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from what is described in these statements. Slide 2 of our presentation contains a discussion of those forward-looking statements and associated risks. In addition, we may include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the appendix to the slide presentation. As part of our discussion of Cheniere's results, today's call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP, or CQP. We do not intend to cover CQP's results separately from those of Cheniere Energy, Inc. The call agenda is shown on Slide 3. Jack will begin with operating and financial highlights. Anatol will then provide an update on the LNG market, and Zach will review our financial results and increased 2024 guidance. After prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. I will now turn the call over to Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO.\nJack Fusco: Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today as we review our outstanding third quarter results, which reflect excellent performance and success achieved across the entire Cheniere platform. Before we get into the quarterly results and our full year guidance increase, I wanted to spend a brief moment addressing the U.S. Presidential election taking place next week. The election is an important time for our country, as we are reminded of the freedom we are afforded as Americans to choose our President every four years. I encourage all of my Cheniere colleagues in the U.S. to exercise the right to vote in order to have their voices heard. As expected, emotions are running high given we are so proximate to Election Day. But no matter the outcome, in a few months' time, upon Inauguration Day, this country will have a new President and a new administration. At Cheniere, we look forward to working with the next President since, issues and policies impacting energy security and availability are so critical to economic interest worldwide. As I mentioned on our August call, we believe our business to be bipartisan. Across multiple administrations spanning the political spectrum, Cheniere has successfully permitted, commercialized, built and operated our platform, and we fully expect that to remain the case for decades to come. We maintain a significant presence and have excellent bipartisan engagement in Washington as well as the state and local level with elected and appointed officials, given our business is heavily-regulated and is a major source of direct and indirect economic output. I look forward to furthering the engagement in D.C. with the new administration, in order to ensure our voice is heard on important policy matters that can affect our business, both here and abroad. Cheniere's assets and overall platform will last for many decades to come, and our objective is to ensure not only our customers and stakeholders, but our country and our allies can realize the full benefits of Cheniere's business, well beyond the outcome of any single election. Please turn to Slide 5, where I'll highlight our key accomplishments for the quarter and introduce our increased guidance ranges for 2024. In the third quarter, we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.5 billion, distributable cash flow of approximately $820 million and net income of approximately $900 million. These excellent financial results are once again thanks to our company-wide commitment to operational excellence. During the third quarter, we continued to execute on our comprehensive capital allocation plan, which is designed to provide investors with cash flow visibility, disciplined capital management and long-term value creation. We repurchased another nearly $300 million of stock during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $2 billion. During the quarter, we also paid down $150 million of debt at Sabine Pass, and we funded approximately $500 million of CapEx mainly related to Stage 3. We also increased our third quarter dividend by 15% to $2 per share annualized. During the quarter, we produced and exported 158 LNG cargoes from our facilities, which was highlighted by the production and export of that 1,000th LNG Cargo from Corpus Christi. I would like to recognize the operational and leadership team and everyone at Corpus Christi for the achievement of this major milestone, and for further reinforcing Cheniere's globally-recognized reputation as a safe and reliable operator. Bechtel continues construction execution on Corpus Christi Stage 3 on budget and on accelerated schedule. As of September 30th, the Stage 3 project had reached approximately 68% complete. Pre-commissioning activities continue on Train 1, with nearly half the required systems turned over to commissioning and start-up teams, who are beginning to place those systems into service. We expect the introduction of first gas into Train 1 to occur in the coming weeks. First gas is an important execution milestone. And from a timing perspective, with that milestone occurring soon, it is consistent with the reduction of first LNG by the end of the year. We are fortunate this year to avoid any impact from hurricanes on operations or construction activities at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi. As a result, our target of achieving first LNG production from Train 1 at Stage 3 by the end of the year remains within reach and substantial completion in early 2025, well ahead of the guaranteed schedule. We continue to expect to have three trains from Stage 3 achieve substantial completion during 2025. Zach will cover the numbers in detail, but we expect to have more open volumes in 2025 than we did in 2024, driven primarily by the substantial completion of those trains, and that reinforces our expectations that 2024 should be an inflection point for EBITDA and financial growth should resume in 2025, as those assets begin operations. Looking to the balance of 2024 today, we're raising and tightening the ranges of our full year guidance to $6 billion to $6.3 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $3.4 billion to $3.7 billion of distributable cash flow. The guidance increase is primarily driven by better-than-expected production and incremental margin along with portfolio optimization activities upstream and downstream of our facility. On the previous call, we discussed a slightly-improved production forecast as a result of our maintenance execution during the second quarter, and we are seeing that forecast production materialize. Even accounting for the increased volume in the forecast, we continue to have an immaterial amount of unsold volume remaining for the balance of the year, as the team has been opportunistically selling our open capacity this fall. Zach will have more to say on the guidance increases in his remarks in a few minutes. Please turn to Slide 6, and we'll update you on important development related to our environmental stewardship. I hope you saw that, yesterday, we announced the establishment of a voluntary Scope 1 methane emissions intensity target for our liquefaction assets. The target calls for Cheniere to consistently maintain a Scope 1 annual measured methane emissions intensity of 0.03% per ton of LNG produced across Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi by 2027. The establishment of the methane target represents the latest milestone in Cheniere's climate strategy, which is built upon our principles of transparency, science, supply chain and operational excellence. Our measurement informed methane target of 0.03% is about one-tenth of the hypothetical emissions intensity utilized in some recent publicized papers estimating lifecycle LNG emissions. This rigorous target reflects our commitment to leverage our data-driven efforts to improve emissions performance across our operations, and is consistent with the requirements of gold standard certification within the UN Environmental Program Oil & Gas Methane Partnership 2.0, which Cheniere joined in 2022. The methane target we have set is the culmination of significant work completed by our team and a series of technology providers and leading academic institutions. We are able to establish this target, thanks to the collaborative work we've done through the programs I've spoken about on previous calls, especially our quantification, monitoring, reporting and verification or QMRV programs. The target builds upon and complements our QMRV program and other climate-related outputs, such as our cargo emission tags and our recently updated and peer reviewed, life cycle assessment. The QMRV efforts, which have been underway for nearly two years and remain ongoing, involve multiscale measurement activities to develop a measurement informed inventory of emissions data, and that data informs the process of establishing the methane target. Included into the data set for our methane target, for example, are readings from approximately 50 aerial emissions measurements of our operations at our facilities over a period of more than a year. Utilizing actual operational data and not simply emissions factors or outdated estimates provides a robust credible foundation that stakeholders can trust, and against which our performance can be measured. Cheniere's approach to environmental performance and stewardship has always been scientific, transparent and methodical, not reactionary or aspirational. And we are pleased to see our strategy and efforts be recognized by ratings providers. During the quarter, MSCI upgraded Cheniere's ESG rating to AAA, the highest score possible, with the upgrades specifically citing improvements in climate management reporting and greenhouse gas intensity performance. We'll continue to pursue our strategy, guided by the same climate and sustainable principles that have helped to lead us to the significant achievements we have accomplished to date. With that, I'll now hand it over to Anatol to discuss the LNG market. Thank you all again for your continued support of Cheniere.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8. Over the last year, we've seen very limited LNG supply growth year-over-year with September being an exception. Global LNG imports increased 33.6 million tons in the month, up more than 9% versus '23. This was largely due to lower levels of planned and unplanned supply outages this year compared to last, rather than true capacity-driven supply growth, and the impact on the market was muted. The perceived underlying market tightness continued to support spot price levels, which continue to climb during the quarter despite healthy storage inventories and relatively soft near-term market dynamics in Europe. September TTF contract settled at $12.54 in MMBtu, up from $11.48 last year and $10.84 in July. Similarly, JKM settled September at $12.78, up from $11.21 last year and $12.14 in July. The run up in month ahead prices was supported by escalating geopolitical risks, various supply outages, strong demand outside of Europe, as well as some cooler weather forecasts within Europe. In the U.S., Henry Hub settled September at $1.93 nearly flat relative to August, but lower than July's settlement of $2.63, an MMBtu despite various price-driven production cuts. Strong demand in Asia kept JKM at a premium TTF during the quarter and throughout most of the year. As shown on the top right, this spread led to an over 18 million ton shift in LNG flows from Europe to Asia for the first nine months of the year. However, this premium has narrowed substantially since the end of September due to cooler weather in Europe, residual Norwegian maintenance and an increasing geopolitical risk premium. I'll address the regional dynamics in more detail in the next slide. As noted, LNG imports into Asia continued to grow in nearly all markets with third quarter receipts increasing 10% year-on-year. The JKT and China market areas combined contributed nearly 70% of the region's total 6.3 million tons year-on-year increase during the quarter. Long stretches of heat in Japan, South Korea and parts of China coupled with the need to fill storage ahead of the upcoming winter season continued to lift gas demand. Notably, China's imports in September surpassed 7 million tons, an increase of 32% year-on-year as two new regas terminals started operations and new storage capacity further supported demand. Taiwan's demand increased by 12% year-on-year during the quarter, as the country shut down one reactor at a 950 megawatt nuclear plant in July. The country's last reactor is scheduled to be shut down in May next year, which we expect will continue to expand the country's gas-fired power demand. During the quarter, Thailand registered a slight decline in imports, primarily due to a boost in domestic gas production. While this renewed production should temporarily offset some of the broader declines in domestic gas production, we expect little to no impact on the country's call for LNG longer-term. As mentioned earlier, Asia's growing imports came at the expense of Europe, where imports were generally flat during the quarter and are down over 20% on the year. European gas fundamentals have remained steady in recent months, with lower power demand and improving but still tepid industrial consumption. However, after a series of mild winters resulting in some demand destruction in the heating sector, some cooler temperatures in September across the region tightened the market, which has been amplified by increased geopolitical risks. European storage levels remained healthy at 95% as of mid-October, but price risk is skewed to the upside. All eyes are now focused on anticipated storage levels exiting winter in early '25, especially with limited support from Ukraine storage, which remains about 30% below last year's levels. Further reductions are expected in Russian flows, potential LNG supply disruptions from further outages or geopolitical escalations, along with continued LNG pull from Egypt, could lead to sustained higher European premiums in order to attract flexible cargoes, particularly, if we revert to normal weather temperatures in the region this year. Additionally, it's important to also acknowledge, the increased competition for LNG cargoes from rising demand in regions outside of Europe and Asia. Low hydropower output in Brazil, along with a strong pull from the MENA region, supported Atlantic demand and tightened the JKM-TTF spread. During the quarter, LNG imports into the MENA region rose 57% year-on-year during the quarter largely due to Egypt, which relied on the spot market to help alleviate rapidly declining domestic production. In addition to imports via Jordan's Aqaba terminal, Egypt imported approximately 20 cargoes during the third quarter and another 20 cargoes are expected to be delivered by year end. In the absence of any immediate relief from new LNG supply, these dynamics should continue to highlight the delicate balance of the global gas market, further supporting the upside price risk, I mentioned earlier. Let's move to the next slide to further develop this point. We've noted for several quarters now how the LNG market remains precariously balanced, sensitive to any signs of potential disruption in supply or demand. From geopolitical tensions to rapid shifts and market balances, driven by extraneous elements such as weather, domestic gas production levels or the changes in the price or availability of competing fuels all underscore the criticality of adequate, reliable and flexible LNG supplies in the global energy mix. In recent weeks, escalating geopolitical tensions have triggered renewed concerns about supply reliability and adequacy amidst that precarious balance. These events have already affected the European gas and LNG markets, playing critical role in elevating prices and market uncertainty. Over the past three years, we've witnessed how geopolitics continue to have a significant impact on commodities, specifically impacting European gas infrastructure, piped gas contracts, flows in transit routes, which has driven higher absolute price levels as well as prolonged elevated market volatility. Today, Europe's winter gas balances remain vulnerable as further cuts in Russian pipeline gas flows seem likely, if the transit agreement through Ukraine is not renewed. The developments in the Middle East raised concerns about upstream and midstream gas infrastructure that could impact Egypt's gas supply security, potentially constraining global LNG market balances. Meanwhile, continued delays from projects under development prevent immediate material relief in the prompt. Global liquefaction utilization has been pushed beyond seasonal norms to produce incremental volumes, but there is limited additional running room and demand continues to be rationed. The lack of spare capacity means that, the system remains particularly vulnerable to any unplanned outages and risks to flow interruptions, be they operational, geopolitical or otherwise. To mitigate against these adverse impacts, we see long-term contracting and the related supply growth underpinned by these agreements as two key pillars for a more resilient, robust and stable market. In the past few years, we've seen an increase in longer-term contracts, some in excess of 20 years, which support the development of much-needed new capacity. Global supply growth and flexibility as well as affordable, stable long-term contracts are key to enable energy security and affordability and to help insulate consumers worldwide from future energy crises like we saw in 2022. Aligned with the establishment of our methane target, we must also highlight the clear environmental advantages of LNG and the critical role it is set to play in global de-carbonization. As developed and developing economies alike, look to increase LNG and natural gas as a component of primary energy supply, Cheniere's leadership role in environmental stewardship will only further separate us from the competition and enable us to continue developing and executing projects, which deliver significant value to our shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Zack to review our financial results and guidance.\nZach Davis: Thanks, Anatol, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our third quarter 2024 results, key financial accomplishments, our increased and tightened 2024 guidance and our current outlook for 2025. Turn to Slide 12. For the third quarter 2024, we generated net income of approximately $900 million, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.5 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $820 million. With these 3rd quarter results, we have now reported positive net income on a quarterly and cumulative trailing four quarter basis eight quarters in a row. Compared to last year, our third quarter 2024 results reflect a higher proportion of our LNG being sold under long-term contracts as well as the continued moderation of international gas prices. These impacts were partially offset by higher volumes of LNG delivered from our two sites during the quarter. Similarly, compared to the second quarter of this year, our production was higher due to most of the planned maintenance at both sites occurring in June. During the third quarter, we recognized in income 5.63 TBtu of physical LNG, which included 5.60 TBtu from our projects and 3 TBtu sourced from third-parties. Approximately 97% of our LNG volumes recognized in the quarter were sold in relation to term SBA or IPM agreements. Our strong financial results continue to support meaningful progress on our 2020 Vision Capital Allocation Plan, with another $1 billion deployed in the third quarter towards shareholder returns, accretive growth and balance sheet management. As of the third quarter, we've allocated over $12 billion of our $20 billion plus target as we continue to reduce our share count and enhance our capital returns, while retaining financial flexibility to fund accretive growth across our platform, all of which should position us to generate over $20 per share of run rate distributable cash flow for our shareholders later this decade. During the third quarter, we have repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares for approximately $282 million. Through the first nine months of the year, we've deployed approximately $2 billion into our shares and reduced our share count by over 1-2 million shares. We have now repurchased approximately 10% of our outstanding shares since announcing our 2020 Vision Plan in September 2022, reducing our shares outstanding from approximately $250 million to under $225 million today in the Q. At this point, we are over halfway to our mid-term goal of 200 million shares. A foundational strategy of the plan is to enable us to buyback more shares when the stock underperforms on an absolute and relative basis, and the year-to-date results demonstrate the power of the plan's design. We are committed to further reducing our total shares outstanding, as we completed the previous $4 billion share repurchase authorization this month and are currently starting to work through our additional $4 billion share repurchase authorization through 2027. As previously announced with our June capital allocation update, we increased our third quarter dividend by approximately 15% to $2 annualized, and intend to follow-through with our guidance of growing our dividend by approximately 10% annually through the end of this decade. This goal should trend us closer to a payout ratio of approximately 20% over time, which will enable us to retain the financial flexibility essential to our comprehensive and balanced long-term capital allocation plan, and disciplined growth objectives. Moving to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we repaid $150 million of outstanding principal of the SBL 2025 notes with cash on hand. We plan to repay the remaining $650 million outstanding principal of these notes with cash on hand ahead of its March 2025 maturity, as we focus our debt pay down within CQP in preparation for financing the SPL expansion project. After repaying the remaining SBL 2025s, we will not have any debt maturing anywhere in the Cheniere complex until the middle of 2026. The rating agencies continue to recognize our progress on the balance sheet. Last week, S&P upwardly revised the ratings outlook at Corpus Christi Holdings, or CCH, to positive. And as noted on our last call, we received our 22nd credit rating upgrade in the third quarter when Fitch upgraded CCH to BBB plus. The continued recognition from the rating agencies is a testament to our team's strategically managing our balance sheet and with regard to these rating agency actions, in particular, reflects the progress achieved on our Stage 3 projects. Speaking of Stage 3, during the quarter, we funded approximately $400 million of CapEx on Stage 3, bringing total spend on the project to over $4.3 billion. With approximately $3 billion in consolidated cash and over $10 billion of overall liquidity throughout the Cheniere complex, we expect to continue equity funding the Stage 3 CapEx, while also remaining active on our buyback program, as we continue to manage down our cash balances, before utilizing the undrawn $3 billion CCH term loan, which we expect to eventually draw in 2025. Turn now to Slide 13, where I will discuss our updated 2024 guidance and initial outlook for 2025. Today, we are raising and tightening our full year 2024 guidance ranges to $6 billion to $6.3 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $3.4 billion to $3.7 billion in distributable cash flow, a $250 million increase to the midpoint as well as tightening of the ranges from $400 million to $300 million or less than 5% of the midpoint of guidance. Our increased guidance is close to equally attributable to optimization activities completed upstream and downstream of our facilities, since the last call, as well as slightly higher production and margins than previously forecast during the quarter and into 4Q. We were also able to tighten the ranges another $100 million, as we are effectively sold out for the balance of this year, reducing the amount of variability in our forecast, in our most contracted year-to-date. That being said, our guidance continues to reflect only contributions from completed or locked-in portfolio optimization activities, as we do not forecast potential contributions from future optimization opportunities, albeit likely more limited this late in the year. And of course, our results could be impacted by the timing of certain cargoes around year end. As noted on prior calls, our DCF could be affected by changes in the tax code, particularly as it relates to the alternative minimum tax and the treatment of certain tax positions related to our unrealized derivatives. These changes could impact the timing and amount of our cash tax payments this year and going forward, but should be immaterial on an NPV basis and not impact our ability to generate over $20 billion of available cash through 2026. And while we do not forecast any contribution to revenues or EBITDA from Stage 3 volumes this year, we continue to target first LNG from Train 1 by year end. Based on the progress achieved to-date, we forecast Train 1 to achieve substantial completion at the end of Q1 or early Q2 next year and Trains 2 and 3 to achieve substantial completion in the second half of the year. With this assumption, we expect to produce approximately 47 million to 48 million tons of LNG in total across our two sites next year, inclusive of forecast Stage 3 volumes and a major maintenance plan at Sabine Pass next year. Though a step change from our 45 million ton run rate across our existing nine trains in operations, the variability is based on uncertainty around specific Stage 3 commissioning and ramp-up schedules, as well as year end timing. Of that 47 million to 48 million tons of production, we forecast over 46 million to over 47 million tons of volume after commissioning, supporting 2025 EBITDA. After accounting for the approximately 43 million tons of long-term contracts already in place, we expect to have over 3 million to over 4 million tons of spot volume available for CMI. The team has been active opportunistically selling some of that 2025 spot volume since our last call, and we currently forecast approximately 2 million to 3 million tons or approximately 100 to 150 TBtu of unsold open capacity in 2025. We therefore also forecast that a $1 change in market margin would impact EBITDA by approximately $100 million to $150 million for the full year. Consistent with previous practice, we intend to provide official 2025 financial guidance on our February call. Looking at curves today, netbacks are averaging around $7 to $8 in 2025. So the timing of our Stage 3 trains coming online and the resulting incremental marketing volumes could drive significant variability in our expected earnings for 2025, as we grow beyond our nine train platform. As a reminder, the Stage 3 trains are being built with a design and technology that is new to us, so the length and extent of the commissioning process is somewhat uncertain. As the initial trains start commissioning, we will gain a better sense on the specific timing of these new volumes and their contribution to our financial results next year. As with the commissioning of our first nine trains, we hope to improve the commissioning process for each subsequent train, by deploying lessons learned. We expect the remaining four mid-scale trains to reach substantial completion in 2026, at which point we have several million tons of new long term contracts starting in 2026 and 2027, keeping our platform over 90% contracted with investment grade counterparties and take-or-pay style, cash flows and averaging approximately 95% contracted through the mid-2030s. Earlier this year, I described 2024, as likely a trough year for EBITDA as all of our long-term contracts supporting the nine train platform had commenced, and international gas prices began to moderate despite spot margins remaining very healthy this year, averaging $8. As Jack mentioned, we still expect this to be the case, as Stage 3 volumes start to hit our P&L in 2025. We remain proud of our team's unrelenting efforts to unlock additional value to support financial metrics well above our nine train run rate guidance this year. Looking ahead to 2025 and beyond, we will continue to leverage the vast competitive advantages afforded by our leading brownfield infrastructure platform in order to enhance the long-term value delivered to shareholders and to continue to supply our customers flexible, reliable and cleaner burning LNG. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning.\nJack Fusco: Good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Thanks for all the color today. Very helpful. I was just wondering a bit on the commissioning process right now. As it stands right now, if you froze where the futures are, or where the spread is for LNG, those commissioning cargoes, what would be the potential scale of reduction in cost for the project? Could you help us kind of think through that?\nZach Davis: Hi, Jeremy. It's Zach. I'd start first with the guidance of 47 million to 48 million tons of total production including commissioning and then I mentioned that, we're over 46 million to over 47 million tons of basically P&L production in '25. So it's around million tons, a little less than that in the guidance right now that is commissioning, that's not supporting EBITDA and will offset CapEx. Because Stage 3 is combined with Trains 1, 2, 3, those volumes in terms of the margins on those commissioning volumes will be a mix of spot volumes and of contracted volumes. And that's accounted for when we talk about spot volumes in the P&L for CMI to sell over 3 million to over 4 million tons. But as you think about around 1 million tons or 50 TBtu, we're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars that will help offset CapEx and just be another funding source for us in the coming year.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Very helpful there hundred of millions of dollars. Thank you. And then just want to I guess come back to the SPL expansion and kind of commercialization efforts at this point. With the FTA authorization, how does that I guess impact discussions that you're having with customers right now? And I guess, what's your outlook for that project and how contracted are you looking for at this point?\nAnatol Feygin: Hi, Jeremy. It's Anatol. Good morning. So as you know, we've got order of magnitude 10,000,000 tons. There are 3 counterparties for Midscale eight, nine and then the balance for Train 7 and we started on Train 8 at SPL. We're taking our time now, as we kind of optimize and figure out what the best path is for our brownfield advantages and we're really pursuing these efforts with certain select counterparties and being very judicious at how we move that project forward, as we figure out the best way to get the right balance of economics returns and contractual support. But ultimately, it's not going to be very different from our kind of 90% plus contracted 7x CapEx-to-EBITDA target as we navigate that. As you've heard Zach mentioned on previous calls, it will probably be a phased approach. So we're in very good shape. We've got great engagement, obviously, as the world thinks through all of these challenges and as we continue to deliver now over 3,700 cargoes from our two facilities without missing a beat. We're in a very good position on our commercial engagements.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you for that.\nOperator: And next question is coming from the line of Theresa Chen with Barclays.\nTheresa Chen: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe first on the commercial front, as a follow-up to Jeremy's question, just as your competing projects in the U.S. Gulf Coast have seemingly continued to face delays and other challenges, while Phase 3 remains on time, on budget. How has this influenced or impacted your commercial discussions for the upcoming projects?\nJack Fusco: Teresa, thank you for the question. I can tell you, we have a very strong relationship with Bechtel that we've built over the last decade that has allowed us to work very closely as a team to be sure that we deliver our projects on budget ahead of schedule and that the performance is guaranteed. Our reliability, the 1,000 cargoes at Corpus Christi, the 2,700 cargoes that we've produced at Sabine have made Anatol's job a little bit easier, because we're finally being recognized as a very reliable safe provider of LNG. And I'll let Anatol cover how those conversations have been going.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Theresa. Thanks, Jack. Anatol's job keeps getting easier and easier. What we announced earlier, I guess last night about the methane target, we've been going down the path of these scientific, kind of very process-driven assessments of our own emissions profile and all of our QMRV efforts. We've talked to you guys about how that's been recognized by our counterparties for the last couple of years, but things as transparent as establishing a methane target are another key component. So we've got the reliability, we've got -- as you pointed out and Jack mentioned the EMC, EPC execution, the reliability of our product and delivering projects on time, on budget and serving our customers with an ever cleaner product. So, yes, lots of tailwinds for Anatol's efforts.\nTheresa Chen: Great. Thank you. And not trying to make Anatol's job harder, but I do have a follow-up on your comments related to the regas outlook in Asia. So, related to, your views on China's regas capacity coming online or Asia in general, where do you think we go from here? Do you think that any, sort of cyclical softness over the near, medium-term could potentially decelerate this pace of expansion? Is there any elasticity in that timeline?\nAnatol Feygin: The expansion has been so rapid that, just algorithmically I would not be shocked if the pace of growth slowed, but China is going to be a 250 million ton regas capacity market. We expect it to get to about 140 million, 150 million tons of imports over the next five to seven years and the rest of Asia is going to continue to grow. I'm not a fan of summarizing kind of the environment as, ''India''. If you look at Asia's growth overall, those two economies are responsible. Everything else is kind of rounds up and down to very little change, and we expect them to continue to grow at very robust rates. One of the things that we talk about that I think would be very beneficial to the market over the medium-term is to the extent the prices moderate as this new supply enters the market over the next three to five years, a number of gassy economies that have been really starved of product at these elevated price levels, we expect to re-enter and to avail themselves of more gas. Unfortunately, they don't have the credit and the scale to have the long-term contracts that afford them the stable and reliable supply that we're touting here. But I think -- I don't see any cyclical slowdown or a moderation of growth rate for gas which has grown, LNG actually has grown over 5% as a CAGR over the last decade and I think that will continue.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Wanted to ask about the beaten rates from this quarter. Are these portfolio optimization initiatives and the higher production that drove the guidance increase in 2024, is that sustainable as we look to 2025?\nZach Davis: We would hope so, but we won't know, until we see it show up in the actuals. We have a budget that we rigorously go through with the operations team and then we go through with the Board, and we'll be in a position to give you a good range for next year in February in terms of financial guidance. But, when it comes to optimization, we're the second largest operator of LNG in the world and we have a lot of ships that we charter and we buy a lot of gas in this country. So there should be opportunities. But to say, what the quantum is, that would be hard to define ahead of time. In terms of the guidance increase this time, I'd say, I'd split it three ways on the optimization side. Upstream of the plants there were better basis differentials that we just couldn't have forecasted earlier on that were able to be captured. Then we were able to opportunity sub-charter more of our length ahead of Stage 3 coming online for the rest of the year. And then, with some of the positions we have all over the world and a few third-party sourcing, we were able to optimize the portfolio downstream and together that was around $100 million plus added to the guidance. On the production side, honestly that would be hard to forecast ahead of time, considering we had a relatively smooth hurricane season for Cheniere. The ambient temperatures were also lower, and they were able to just outperform at both sites, and honestly pick up from earlier in the year, where production was slightly down. So that alone with $8, $9 margins for the rest of this year added another $100 million plus. So hard to say, we can bake that in, and I would assume in a February guidance we wouldn't be baking that in initially.\nMichael Blum: Okay, great. Now that's good color. Appreciate it. And then, I was wondering if you can give us a sense of your assumptions on the timeline for the three Stage 3 trains that you expect to complete in 2025? And given your track record and Bechtel's track record, I mean, I realize this is a new technology, but do you think a fourth train could possibly be achieved in 2025? Thanks.\nJack Fusco: Michael, this is Jack. As you know, I'm pushing the organization pretty hard right now on our construction efforts. We have today over 70 operators, seconded to Bechtel, that are commissioning and in start-up mode. And I tend to be a glass is half full kind of guy, but I think our guiding you to three trains would be enough for me to pop a bottle of champagne and celebrate. Four trains, I think would be a little much for us to accomplish as a team. And I'm just being totally transparent and honest with you. But I'll turn it over to Zack and he can tell you what his assumptions are in his production model.\nZach Davis: Sure. Just for a little more clarity, on the high-end if we're going to make it to 48 million tons of production next year. You'd have to assume that Trains 1, 2 and 3 reach substantial completion by the end of Q1, Q2 and Q3 respectively. And then on the lower end where we're closer to 47 million, we have decent visibility on Train 1. So we're hopeful that can still come online in late Q1 or early Q2, but then it would be a little bit later in the second half of the year for Trains 2 and 3 to end up at the 47 million ton level. So ideally we'll have a bit more of an understanding of how things are going by the next call. But even by the next call, we don't expect to have substantial completion of even Train 1.\nMichael Blum: Very clear. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.\nKeith Stanley: Hi, good morning.\nJack Fusco: Good morning.\nKeith Stanley: Good morning. First just curious on the 100 to 150 TBtu of open exposure. How comfortable would you be trying to hedge more of that ahead of the winter, or do you prefer to keep that open just operationally until you have the Stage 3 trains starting to come online?\nZach Davis: This is Zach. I saw a few notes from folks this morning and I just want to make it clear. As you think about 2025, first and foremost, it's all about the CMI spot capacity. The CMI spot capacity that we guided to is over 3 million to over 4 million tons. Since the call, we were able to be opportunistic and sell some of our 2025 length and we sold over 1 million tons in a market that was trading around $8 at the time for next year. So that's locking-in nicely around a $0.5 billion for the company. That was mainly locking in production from the existing nine trains, just because we have more clarity, more understanding of how those produce over time, whereas it would be very difficult for us to sell physically or even to sell -- hedge financially volumes that are not as certain. So some of those will have to be closer to the date of loading than to be as proactive as we have been. With all that said, Q1 and Q4 will still be our biggest production quarters, just with lower ambient temperatures and the fact that our major maintenance will happen in the summer. Then as you can imagine with the cadence of the trains coming online, at best there will be one train operating in Q2 and then ideally in second half of the year two more come online. So Q2 is probably our lowest level of production for the year. So we might have more confidence going into next year or early next year to start selling at the latter part of the year, as we have more production. But assume we're -- we sold quite a bit already considering it's only October still.\nKeith Stanley: That all makes sense. Second question, just on markets question. What are your expectations for European demand into next year and over the medium-term after a big drop in power-driven demand this year? I think you said you're seeing some stabilization in European demand?\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Thanks, Keith. The one big issue that will play out is how the last BCF a day or so of pipe flows through Ukraine from Gazprom play out. Our expectation, market expectation is that, that does not get renewed. The delta in European gas demand is much smaller than that. We're seeing good stabilization in the larger economies in terms of industrial power, as you pointed out, is a big swing factor, if it is a robust wind period that has a couple of million ton impact on the overall demand. But, structurally, the thing that has changed is that, we don't see infrastructure being a constraint anymore, not just on the regas side, but also on pipeline and the ability to move gas intra Europe. We think that natural gas demand and hence LNG demand for Europe is going to remain fairly stable through the middle of next decade. Then, it's more of a question mark and we expect it to decline modestly. But, we expect it to stay in this kind of 120 million, 130 million ton market range for a number of years.\nKeith Stanley: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Ben Nolan with Stifel.\nBen Nolan: Hi, appreciate it. Good morning, guys. So I wanted to ask, maybe Anatol, if we could -- you talk about much higher prices in LNG and all of the potential disruptions in the Middle East, Ukraine and elsewhere and people sort of hedging their bets and that leading to potentially more long-term contracting. Although certainly for U.S. operators and just generally globally, it doesn't seem like, there's been a terrible amount of actual activity on the long-term side. Do you think -- maybe particularly to the U.S., do you think your customers are maybe just waiting until after the election, or I guess, I would have thought a little bit more activity given all the noise out there?\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Ben. I think as we've discussed in previous quarters, what we're going through now is a kind of post-'22, '23 fog of war period where 75 million tons were executed and the market is figuring out that, it's not that easy to execute these things, from a timing standpoint, from a regulatory, from an economic standpoint, commercial as well. So the market is thinking through how to react to that. You're absolutely right. There were only a handful of long-term transactions. Ours with Galp being one of three, I think, 20 year deals in the quarter. But that is -- I would say that's not a reflection of kind of market appetite for more and I think you'll continue to see a very healthy market for projects that can be advanced economically and reliably. So you're right, we're going through a period of re-evaluation by customers. As Teresa said, against that backdrop my job is very easy.\nBen Nolan: Got you. Okay. And then secondly, for me is, on the shipping side actually. There has been a pretty sharp decline in shipping spot rates, and I know you guys are primarily long term contracted and use that as an opportunity to use your net long position as an opportunity to re-contract when you have open availability. But just curious, if there's any way strategically for you to maybe take advantage of an especially soft LNG shipping market at the moment?\nJack Fusco: Hi, Ben. I guess the number one driver, as Zach has alluded to, is our management of that fleet and the fact that, we have shipping lined up and committed for our own volumes and in many cases like the producer transactions that we partner with as well. The team has done a great job and one of the big drivers of optimization opportunities has been chartering out that length, as these optimization opportunities presented themselves. We are, I think today the second largest charterer of LNG vessels. We have been for a number of years by far the largest, the most dynamic player in chartering vessels in and out. So, you're absolutely right. There are opportunities to optimize the portfolio. We are, of course, on the eve of commissioning Stage 3 and these lower day rates provide some other opportunities on that front, as we await the production from Train 1. So that's one of the reasons why we don't bake into our guidance things that we have not locked in on that front, because you never know what pitch is going to come your way, whether it will be a 300,000 day rate, one winter or 20,000 in the prompt as we're seeing today.\nBen Nolan: Got it. Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.\nBob Brackett: Good morning. I am looking at the '25 guide and thinking about a guide that looks like flat, Sabine Pass year-on-year, but you commented about planned major maintenance there. Can I infer that, it's about the same scale of major maintenance as last year or is there something more I should be thinking about?\nJack Fusco: Thanks, Bob. The major maintenance at Sabine Train 3, 4 is going to be longer this coming year than it was this past year. However, what's offsetting that is some of the smaller debottlenecking efforts that we've already pursued like the fin fans, like we mentioned on previous calls. That's helped us get to a point where we can do such a major maintenance on two trains and still be around 45 million tons on the existing nine.\nBob Brackett: Very clear. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bank of America.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Hi, good morning. Assuming the current path remains for the DOE to lift their permit pause, after the environmental assessment, have you heard anything from them about how future permit requirements could change, or what extra environmental requirements they would be looking forward to grant permits? And how is Cheniere positioned for that on Corpus 8 and 9 and the Sabine Pass expansion?\nZach Davis: Hi, Jean. As you know, we work really closely with the Department of Energy. There's a lot of speculation around which way the pause may head. It's clear to us that, nothing's going to happen until after next week. And then, from that point, it could be -- it's pretty broad bookends, on which way the band could go. So I would wait until next week. But before I give you anything concrete, but I would say that, we are in very, very good shape with 8 and 9. And actually with the Sabine expansion, it's clear that brownfield expansions are going to be treated a lot differently than greenfield expansions going forward. And I think, we're in a really good position to maximize the benefits of our existing platform.\nJean Ann Salisbury: That's helpful. Thank you. And as a follow-up, there was a rush by U.S. ENPs to sign up for LNG deals the last few years, which fender some of Cheniere's IPM contracts. Can you speak to whether that demand is still strong given just that the U.S. TTFR has kind of come in and is expected to come in a bit from here?\nAnatol Feygin: Hi, Jean, it's Anatol. That appetite that we in some sense launched now five plus years ago remains very robust. One of the dynamics that of course has played out in the interim is the consolidation has improved the credit quality and capital discipline has improved the credit quality of that cohort. You've seen a number of transactions that are variations on that theme, shorter tenure, some deals with intermediaries that reflect the quantum of appetite for those deals. As you know, we've said that, while we have very good engagement, we don't expect this to be a kind of double-digits number of counterparties, again being very selective in terms of scale, credit and ability to physically deliver volumes into our infrastructure. There are lots of things we like about those IPM transactions, but like with everything else we're being very methodical. The appetite to do them is multiples of what you're seeing from us.\nJean Ann Salisbury: That makes sense. Thanks. I'll leave it there.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs.\nJohn Mackay: Thanks for the time. This might be a longer question than top of the hour, but I'll take it anyway. You guys have kept your $2 to $2.50 kind of baked-in marketing range for the outer year EBITDA guidance. Even though, we've seen kind of EPC costs go up pretty dramatically for new projects, et cetera, through there. I guess could you spend a second just walking us through again your kind of thought process on that, whether that implied cost of new capacity in the market could be changing, and what would push you guys to kind of think about moving that number?\nZach Davis: I'll go first on the guidance. On the $2 to $2.5, I think we're just trying to make it as clear as possible for you folks, what we see in the run rate and everyone can make their own assumptions considering the balance of this year is at $9 netbacks, next year is $8 year after $6 and even in '27 we're talking about $4 netbacks today. So the fact that with every dollar turn even in the run rate, we're spreading what like $300 million of EBITDA. So we try to give that guidance that way. In terms of SPAs, I'm going to hand it over to Anatol. But basically, we're pushing the limits of that range right now, and that range still works for us specifically on these brownfield expansions, thanks to all the equipment and infrastructure we already have in place. It's a good question for some others that are trying to do greenfield, but for midscale eight to nine, Sabine expansion and everything else we want to do at Corpus and Sabine, we're in a great spot that we can do that still at around 7x CapEx to EBITDA. But, Anatol?\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Thanks, John. I think your kind of fundamental premise is right as you heard from Zach that, a, things are not getting cheaper or easier and execution risks are becoming more and more apparent to the counterparties. That said, while the market for kind of U.S. Gulf Coast projects has reached the high-end of that range, I wouldn't say that today the competitive landscape allows for reaching that meaningfully. So, we're still in or around that range, but at the high-end we'll see what the future brings.\nJohn Mackay: All right. That's clear. Thanks for your time.\nOperator: And our final question is coming from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.\nCraig Shere: Thanks for fitting me in. Congratulations on the quarter. Zach, if I'm doing the math right, even after dividend share buybacks and your Stage 3 funding, I think you ended three quarter with more C-Corp cash than you did in 2Q. And of course, your construction revolver remains untapped. How do you think about growth CapEx funding into modular train eight and nine FID, if your corporate cash balances remain well above the $1 billion mark that's kind of the long term target?\nZach Davis: Hi, Craig. Thanks for the question. I mean, yes, the cash balance on 9/30 is around $3 billion on a consolidated basis. That was around $4.5 billion going into this year. Considering we've already deployed, I think around $4.2 billion across the four pillars of capital allocation, but year to date DCF is around $2.7 billion that makes about the right sense. You can assume that, we'll be continually deploying probably more than our DCF to work that cash balance down over time. But, as we have this cash balance as margins are more elevated, we're going to use that cash to obviously continue the buyback at a pretty good pace, as well as continue to equity fund Stage 3, which we've done 100% life to date. At some point we'll have that $3 billion of liquidity from that term loan that we can use as just general liquidity for the company and still stay comfortably IG at all the entities. But, in the meantime, it's pretty efficient for us to use this excess cash, work it down, get closer to $1 billion plus at some point next year.\nCraig Shere: Great. And last one, hopefully pretty quick. I want to pick up on Jean Ann's question about DoE authorizations. If we had a Harris Administration and there was more of a emission mandate, do you see your kind of industry-leading methane intensity targets and emission tags kind of mitigating the need for CCS projects that maybe some peers would have to do since they can't prove what they got?\nJack Fusco: I don't know how to call it, Craig, but I can tell you that we continue to focus on our program, and using science and real measurement data rather than hypothetical guesstimates of what emissions are. We continue to make some very good progress, not only here in the U.S, but also in Europe and worldwide abroad. I would expect that the clean energy transition that the Biden Administration has been so focused on will continue under a Harris administration. So, yes, I would expect it to be more of a focus for that administration than under a Trump administration. But we'll have to see what happens next week and then go from there.\nCraig Shere: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: And I will now turn the call back to the company, Cheniere, for any closing remarks.\nJack Fusco: Yes. Hi. This is Jack. I just want to say thank you again for all of your support and please be safe on this Halloween night.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Anatol Feygin",
            "content": "Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8. Over the last year, we've seen very limited LNG supply growth year-over-year with September being an exception. Global LNG imports increased 33.6 million tons in the month, up more than 9% versus '23. This was largely due to lower levels of planned and unplanned supply outages this year compared to last, rather than true capacity-driven supply growth, and the impact on the market was muted. The perceived underlying market tightness continued to support spot price levels, which continue to climb during the quarter despite healthy storage inventories and relatively soft near-term market dynamics in Europe. September TTF contract settled at $12.54 in MMBtu, up from $11.48 last year and $10.84 in July. Similarly, JKM settled September at $12.78, up from $11.21 last year and $12.14 in July. The run up in month ahead prices was supported by escalating geopolitical risks, various supply outages, strong demand outside of Europe, as well as some cooler weather forecasts within Europe. In the U.S., Henry Hub settled September at $1.93 nearly flat relative to August, but lower than July's settlement of $2.63, an MMBtu despite various price-driven production cuts. Strong demand in Asia kept JKM at a premium TTF during the quarter and throughout most of the year. As shown on the top right, this spread led to an over 18 million ton shift in LNG flows from Europe to Asia for the first nine months of the year. However, this premium has narrowed substantially since the end of September due to cooler weather in Europe, residual Norwegian maintenance and an increasing geopolitical risk premium. I'll address the regional dynamics in more detail in the next slide. As noted, LNG imports into Asia continued to grow in nearly all markets with third quarter receipts increasing 10% year-on-year. The JKT and China market areas combined contributed nearly 70% of the region's total 6.3 million tons year-on-year increase during the quarter. Long stretches of heat in Japan, South Korea and parts of China coupled with the need to fill storage ahead of the upcoming winter season continued to lift gas demand. Notably, China's imports in September surpassed 7 million tons, an increase of 32% year-on-year as two new regas terminals started operations and new storage capacity further supported demand. Taiwan's demand increased by 12% year-on-year during the quarter, as the country shut down one reactor at a 950 megawatt nuclear plant in July. The country's last reactor is scheduled to be shut down in May next year, which we expect will continue to expand the country's gas-fired power demand. During the quarter, Thailand registered a slight decline in imports, primarily due to a boost in domestic gas production. While this renewed production should temporarily offset some of the broader declines in domestic gas production, we expect little to no impact on the country's call for LNG longer-term. As mentioned earlier, Asia's growing imports came at the expense of Europe, where imports were generally flat during the quarter and are down over 20% on the year. European gas fundamentals have remained steady in recent months, with lower power demand and improving but still tepid industrial consumption. However, after a series of mild winters resulting in some demand destruction in the heating sector, some cooler temperatures in September across the region tightened the market, which has been amplified by increased geopolitical risks. European storage levels remained healthy at 95% as of mid-October, but price risk is skewed to the upside. All eyes are now focused on anticipated storage levels exiting winter in early '25, especially with limited support from Ukraine storage, which remains about 30% below last year's levels. Further reductions are expected in Russian flows, potential LNG supply disruptions from further outages or geopolitical escalations, along with continued LNG pull from Egypt, could lead to sustained higher European premiums in order to attract flexible cargoes, particularly, if we revert to normal weather temperatures in the region this year. Additionally, it's important to also acknowledge, the increased competition for LNG cargoes from rising demand in regions outside of Europe and Asia. Low hydropower output in Brazil, along with a strong pull from the MENA region, supported Atlantic demand and tightened the JKM-TTF spread. During the quarter, LNG imports into the MENA region rose 57% year-on-year during the quarter largely due to Egypt, which relied on the spot market to help alleviate rapidly declining domestic production. In addition to imports via Jordan's Aqaba terminal, Egypt imported approximately 20 cargoes during the third quarter and another 20 cargoes are expected to be delivered by year end. In the absence of any immediate relief from new LNG supply, these dynamics should continue to highlight the delicate balance of the global gas market, further supporting the upside price risk, I mentioned earlier. Let's move to the next slide to further develop this point. We've noted for several quarters now how the LNG market remains precariously balanced, sensitive to any signs of potential disruption in supply or demand. From geopolitical tensions to rapid shifts and market balances, driven by extraneous elements such as weather, domestic gas production levels or the changes in the price or availability of competing fuels all underscore the criticality of adequate, reliable and flexible LNG supplies in the global energy mix. In recent weeks, escalating geopolitical tensions have triggered renewed concerns about supply reliability and adequacy amidst that precarious balance. These events have already affected the European gas and LNG markets, playing critical role in elevating prices and market uncertainty. Over the past three years, we've witnessed how geopolitics continue to have a significant impact on commodities, specifically impacting European gas infrastructure, piped gas contracts, flows in transit routes, which has driven higher absolute price levels as well as prolonged elevated market volatility. Today, Europe's winter gas balances remain vulnerable as further cuts in Russian pipeline gas flows seem likely, if the transit agreement through Ukraine is not renewed. The developments in the Middle East raised concerns about upstream and midstream gas infrastructure that could impact Egypt's gas supply security, potentially constraining global LNG market balances. Meanwhile, continued delays from projects under development prevent immediate material relief in the prompt. Global liquefaction utilization has been pushed beyond seasonal norms to produce incremental volumes, but there is limited additional running room and demand continues to be rationed. The lack of spare capacity means that, the system remains particularly vulnerable to any unplanned outages and risks to flow interruptions, be they operational, geopolitical or otherwise. To mitigate against these adverse impacts, we see long-term contracting and the related supply growth underpinned by these agreements as two key pillars for a more resilient, robust and stable market. In the past few years, we've seen an increase in longer-term contracts, some in excess of 20 years, which support the development of much-needed new capacity. Global supply growth and flexibility as well as affordable, stable long-term contracts are key to enable energy security and affordability and to help insulate consumers worldwide from future energy crises like we saw in 2022. Aligned with the establishment of our methane target, we must also highlight the clear environmental advantages of LNG and the critical role it is set to play in global de-carbonization. As developed and developing economies alike, look to increase LNG and natural gas as a component of primary energy supply, Cheniere's leadership role in environmental stewardship will only further separate us from the competition and enable us to continue developing and executing projects, which deliver significant value to our shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Zack to review our financial results and guidance. Hi, Jeremy. It's Anatol. Good morning. So as you know, we've got order of magnitude 10,000,000 tons. There are 3 counterparties for Midscale eight, nine and then the balance for Train 7 and we started on Train 8 at SPL. We're taking our time now, as we kind of optimize and figure out what the best path is for our brownfield advantages and we're really pursuing these efforts with certain select counterparties and being very judicious at how we move that project forward, as we figure out the best way to get the right balance of economics returns and contractual support. But ultimately, it's not going to be very different from our kind of 90% plus contracted 7x CapEx-to-EBITDA target as we navigate that. As you've heard Zach mentioned on previous calls, it will probably be a phased approach. So we're in very good shape. We've got great engagement, obviously, as the world thinks through all of these challenges and as we continue to deliver now over 3,700 cargoes from our two facilities without missing a beat. We're in a very good position on our commercial engagements. Thanks, Theresa. Thanks, Jack. Anatol's job keeps getting easier and easier. What we announced earlier, I guess last night about the methane target, we've been going down the path of these scientific, kind of very process-driven assessments of our own emissions profile and all of our QMRV efforts. We've talked to you guys about how that's been recognized by our counterparties for the last couple of years, but things as transparent as establishing a methane target are another key component. So we've got the reliability, we've got -- as you pointed out and Jack mentioned the EMC, EPC execution, the reliability of our product and delivering projects on time, on budget and serving our customers with an ever cleaner product. So, yes, lots of tailwinds for Anatol's efforts. The expansion has been so rapid that, just algorithmically I would not be shocked if the pace of growth slowed, but China is going to be a 250 million ton regas capacity market. We expect it to get to about 140 million, 150 million tons of imports over the next five to seven years and the rest of Asia is going to continue to grow. I'm not a fan of summarizing kind of the environment as, ''India''. If you look at Asia's growth overall, those two economies are responsible. Everything else is kind of rounds up and down to very little change, and we expect them to continue to grow at very robust rates. One of the things that we talk about that I think would be very beneficial to the market over the medium-term is to the extent the prices moderate as this new supply enters the market over the next three to five years, a number of gassy economies that have been really starved of product at these elevated price levels, we expect to re-enter and to avail themselves of more gas. Unfortunately, they don't have the credit and the scale to have the long-term contracts that afford them the stable and reliable supply that we're touting here. But I think -- I don't see any cyclical slowdown or a moderation of growth rate for gas which has grown, LNG actually has grown over 5% as a CAGR over the last decade and I think that will continue. Yes. Thanks, Keith. The one big issue that will play out is how the last BCF a day or so of pipe flows through Ukraine from Gazprom play out. Our expectation, market expectation is that, that does not get renewed. The delta in European gas demand is much smaller than that. We're seeing good stabilization in the larger economies in terms of industrial power, as you pointed out, is a big swing factor, if it is a robust wind period that has a couple of million ton impact on the overall demand. But, structurally, the thing that has changed is that, we don't see infrastructure being a constraint anymore, not just on the regas side, but also on pipeline and the ability to move gas intra Europe. We think that natural gas demand and hence LNG demand for Europe is going to remain fairly stable through the middle of next decade. Then, it's more of a question mark and we expect it to decline modestly. But, we expect it to stay in this kind of 120 million, 130 million ton market range for a number of years. Thanks, Ben. I think as we've discussed in previous quarters, what we're going through now is a kind of post-'22, '23 fog of war period where 75 million tons were executed and the market is figuring out that, it's not that easy to execute these things, from a timing standpoint, from a regulatory, from an economic standpoint, commercial as well. So the market is thinking through how to react to that. You're absolutely right. There were only a handful of long-term transactions. Ours with Galp being one of three, I think, 20 year deals in the quarter. But that is -- I would say that's not a reflection of kind of market appetite for more and I think you'll continue to see a very healthy market for projects that can be advanced economically and reliably. So you're right, we're going through a period of re-evaluation by customers. As Teresa said, against that backdrop my job is very easy. Hi, Jean, it's Anatol. That appetite that we in some sense launched now five plus years ago remains very robust. One of the dynamics that of course has played out in the interim is the consolidation has improved the credit quality and capital discipline has improved the credit quality of that cohort. You've seen a number of transactions that are variations on that theme, shorter tenure, some deals with intermediaries that reflect the quantum of appetite for those deals. As you know, we've said that, while we have very good engagement, we don't expect this to be a kind of double-digits number of counterparties, again being very selective in terms of scale, credit and ability to physically deliver volumes into our infrastructure. There are lots of things we like about those IPM transactions, but like with everything else we're being very methodical. The appetite to do them is multiples of what you're seeing from us. Yes. Thanks, John. I think your kind of fundamental premise is right as you heard from Zach that, a, things are not getting cheaper or easier and execution risks are becoming more and more apparent to the counterparties. That said, while the market for kind of U.S. Gulf Coast projects has reached the high-end of that range, I wouldn't say that today the competitive landscape allows for reaching that meaningfully. So, we're still in or around that range, but at the high-end we'll see what the future brings."

            "name": "Jack Fusco",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today as we review our outstanding third quarter results, which reflect excellent performance and success achieved across the entire Cheniere platform. Before we get into the quarterly results and our full year guidance increase, I wanted to spend a brief moment addressing the U.S. Presidential election taking place next week. The election is an important time for our country, as we are reminded of the freedom we are afforded as Americans to choose our President every four years. I encourage all of my Cheniere colleagues in the U.S. to exercise the right to vote in order to have their voices heard. As expected, emotions are running high given we are so proximate to Election Day. But no matter the outcome, in a few months' time, upon Inauguration Day, this country will have a new President and a new administration. At Cheniere, we look forward to working with the next President since, issues and policies impacting energy security and availability are so critical to economic interest worldwide. As I mentioned on our August call, we believe our business to be bipartisan. Across multiple administrations spanning the political spectrum, Cheniere has successfully permitted, commercialized, built and operated our platform, and we fully expect that to remain the case for decades to come. We maintain a significant presence and have excellent bipartisan engagement in Washington as well as the state and local level with elected and appointed officials, given our business is heavily-regulated and is a major source of direct and indirect economic output. I look forward to furthering the engagement in D.C. with the new administration, in order to ensure our voice is heard on important policy matters that can affect our business, both here and abroad. Cheniere's assets and overall platform will last for many decades to come, and our objective is to ensure not only our customers and stakeholders, but our country and our allies can realize the full benefits of Cheniere's business, well beyond the outcome of any single election. Please turn to Slide 5, where I'll highlight our key accomplishments for the quarter and introduce our increased guidance ranges for 2024. In the third quarter, we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.5 billion, distributable cash flow of approximately $820 million and net income of approximately $900 million. These excellent financial results are once again thanks to our company-wide commitment to operational excellence. During the third quarter, we continued to execute on our comprehensive capital allocation plan, which is designed to provide investors with cash flow visibility, disciplined capital management and long-term value creation. We repurchased another nearly $300 million of stock during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $2 billion. During the quarter, we also paid down $150 million of debt at Sabine Pass, and we funded approximately $500 million of CapEx mainly related to Stage 3. We also increased our third quarter dividend by 15% to $2 per share annualized. During the quarter, we produced and exported 158 LNG cargoes from our facilities, which was highlighted by the production and export of that 1,000th LNG Cargo from Corpus Christi. I would like to recognize the operational and leadership team and everyone at Corpus Christi for the achievement of this major milestone, and for further reinforcing Cheniere's globally-recognized reputation as a safe and reliable operator. Bechtel continues construction execution on Corpus Christi Stage 3 on budget and on accelerated schedule. As of September 30th, the Stage 3 project had reached approximately 68% complete. Pre-commissioning activities continue on Train 1, with nearly half the required systems turned over to commissioning and start-up teams, who are beginning to place those systems into service. We expect the introduction of first gas into Train 1 to occur in the coming weeks. First gas is an important execution milestone. And from a timing perspective, with that milestone occurring soon, it is consistent with the reduction of first LNG by the end of the year. We are fortunate this year to avoid any impact from hurricanes on operations or construction activities at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi. As a result, our target of achieving first LNG production from Train 1 at Stage 3 by the end of the year remains within reach and substantial completion in early 2025, well ahead of the guaranteed schedule. We continue to expect to have three trains from Stage 3 achieve substantial completion during 2025. Zach will cover the numbers in detail, but we expect to have more open volumes in 2025 than we did in 2024, driven primarily by the substantial completion of those trains, and that reinforces our expectations that 2024 should be an inflection point for EBITDA and financial growth should resume in 2025, as those assets begin operations. Looking to the balance of 2024 today, we're raising and tightening the ranges of our full year guidance to $6 billion to $6.3 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $3.4 billion to $3.7 billion of distributable cash flow. The guidance increase is primarily driven by better-than-expected production and incremental margin along with portfolio optimization activities upstream and downstream of our facility. On the previous call, we discussed a slightly-improved production forecast as a result of our maintenance execution during the second quarter, and we are seeing that forecast production materialize. Even accounting for the increased volume in the forecast, we continue to have an immaterial amount of unsold volume remaining for the balance of the year, as the team has been opportunistically selling our open capacity this fall. Zach will have more to say on the guidance increases in his remarks in a few minutes. Please turn to Slide 6, and we'll update you on important development related to our environmental stewardship. I hope you saw that, yesterday, we announced the establishment of a voluntary Scope 1 methane emissions intensity target for our liquefaction assets. The target calls for Cheniere to consistently maintain a Scope 1 annual measured methane emissions intensity of 0.03% per ton of LNG produced across Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi by 2027. The establishment of the methane target represents the latest milestone in Cheniere's climate strategy, which is built upon our principles of transparency, science, supply chain and operational excellence. Our measurement informed methane target of 0.03% is about one-tenth of the hypothetical emissions intensity utilized in some recent publicized papers estimating lifecycle LNG emissions. This rigorous target reflects our commitment to leverage our data-driven efforts to improve emissions performance across our operations, and is consistent with the requirements of gold standard certification within the UN Environmental Program Oil & Gas Methane Partnership 2.0, which Cheniere joined in 2022. The methane target we have set is the culmination of significant work completed by our team and a series of technology providers and leading academic institutions. We are able to establish this target, thanks to the collaborative work we've done through the programs I've spoken about on previous calls, especially our quantification, monitoring, reporting and verification or QMRV programs. The target builds upon and complements our QMRV program and other climate-related outputs, such as our cargo emission tags and our recently updated and peer reviewed, life cycle assessment. The QMRV efforts, which have been underway for nearly two years and remain ongoing, involve multiscale measurement activities to develop a measurement informed inventory of emissions data, and that data informs the process of establishing the methane target. Included into the data set for our methane target, for example, are readings from approximately 50 aerial emissions measurements of our operations at our facilities over a period of more than a year. Utilizing actual operational data and not simply emissions factors or outdated estimates provides a robust credible foundation that stakeholders can trust, and against which our performance can be measured. Cheniere's approach to environmental performance and stewardship has always been scientific, transparent and methodical, not reactionary or aspirational. And we are pleased to see our strategy and efforts be recognized by ratings providers. During the quarter, MSCI upgraded Cheniere's ESG rating to AAA, the highest score possible, with the upgrades specifically citing improvements in climate management reporting and greenhouse gas intensity performance. We'll continue to pursue our strategy, guided by the same climate and sustainable principles that have helped to lead us to the significant achievements we have accomplished to date. With that, I'll now hand it over to Anatol to discuss the LNG market. Thank you all again for your continued support of Cheniere. Good morning, Jeremy. Teresa, thank you for the question. I can tell you, we have a very strong relationship with Bechtel that we've built over the last decade that has allowed us to work very closely as a team to be sure that we deliver our projects on budget ahead of schedule and that the performance is guaranteed. Our reliability, the 1,000 cargoes at Corpus Christi, the 2,700 cargoes that we've produced at Sabine have made Anatol's job a little bit easier, because we're finally being recognized as a very reliable safe provider of LNG. And I'll let Anatol cover how those conversations have been going. Michael, this is Jack. As you know, I'm pushing the organization pretty hard right now on our construction efforts. We have today over 70 operators, seconded to Bechtel, that are commissioning and in start-up mode. And I tend to be a glass is half full kind of guy, but I think our guiding you to three trains would be enough for me to pop a bottle of champagne and celebrate. Four trains, I think would be a little much for us to accomplish as a team. And I'm just being totally transparent and honest with you. But I'll turn it over to Zack and he can tell you what his assumptions are in his production model. Good morning. Hi, Ben. I guess the number one driver, as Zach has alluded to, is our management of that fleet and the fact that, we have shipping lined up and committed for our own volumes and in many cases like the producer transactions that we partner with as well. The team has done a great job and one of the big drivers of optimization opportunities has been chartering out that length, as these optimization opportunities presented themselves. We are, I think today the second largest charterer of LNG vessels. We have been for a number of years by far the largest, the most dynamic player in chartering vessels in and out. So, you're absolutely right. There are opportunities to optimize the portfolio. We are, of course, on the eve of commissioning Stage 3 and these lower day rates provide some other opportunities on that front, as we await the production from Train 1. So that's one of the reasons why we don't bake into our guidance things that we have not locked in on that front, because you never know what pitch is going to come your way, whether it will be a 300,000 day rate, one winter or 20,000 in the prompt as we're seeing today. Thanks, Bob. The major maintenance at Sabine Train 3, 4 is going to be longer this coming year than it was this past year. However, what's offsetting that is some of the smaller debottlenecking efforts that we've already pursued like the fin fans, like we mentioned on previous calls. That's helped us get to a point where we can do such a major maintenance on two trains and still be around 45 million tons on the existing nine. I don't know how to call it, Craig, but I can tell you that we continue to focus on our program, and using science and real measurement data rather than hypothetical guesstimates of what emissions are. We continue to make some very good progress, not only here in the U.S, but also in Europe and worldwide abroad. I would expect that the clean energy transition that the Biden Administration has been so focused on will continue under a Harris administration. So, yes, I would expect it to be more of a focus for that administration than under a Trump administration. But we'll have to see what happens next week and then go from there. Yes. Hi. This is Jack. I just want to say thank you again for all of your support and please be safe on this Halloween night."

            "name": "Zach Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Anatol, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our third quarter 2024 results, key financial accomplishments, our increased and tightened 2024 guidance and our current outlook for 2025. Turn to Slide 12. For the third quarter 2024, we generated net income of approximately $900 million, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.5 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $820 million. With these 3rd quarter results, we have now reported positive net income on a quarterly and cumulative trailing four quarter basis eight quarters in a row. Compared to last year, our third quarter 2024 results reflect a higher proportion of our LNG being sold under long-term contracts as well as the continued moderation of international gas prices. These impacts were partially offset by higher volumes of LNG delivered from our two sites during the quarter. Similarly, compared to the second quarter of this year, our production was higher due to most of the planned maintenance at both sites occurring in June. During the third quarter, we recognized in income 5.63 TBtu of physical LNG, which included 5.60 TBtu from our projects and 3 TBtu sourced from third-parties. Approximately 97% of our LNG volumes recognized in the quarter were sold in relation to term SBA or IPM agreements. Our strong financial results continue to support meaningful progress on our 2020 Vision Capital Allocation Plan, with another $1 billion deployed in the third quarter towards shareholder returns, accretive growth and balance sheet management. As of the third quarter, we've allocated over $12 billion of our $20 billion plus target as we continue to reduce our share count and enhance our capital returns, while retaining financial flexibility to fund accretive growth across our platform, all of which should position us to generate over $20 per share of run rate distributable cash flow for our shareholders later this decade. During the third quarter, we have repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares for approximately $282 million. Through the first nine months of the year, we've deployed approximately $2 billion into our shares and reduced our share count by over 1-2 million shares. We have now repurchased approximately 10% of our outstanding shares since announcing our 2020 Vision Plan in September 2022, reducing our shares outstanding from approximately $250 million to under $225 million today in the Q. At this point, we are over halfway to our mid-term goal of 200 million shares. A foundational strategy of the plan is to enable us to buyback more shares when the stock underperforms on an absolute and relative basis, and the year-to-date results demonstrate the power of the plan's design. We are committed to further reducing our total shares outstanding, as we completed the previous $4 billion share repurchase authorization this month and are currently starting to work through our additional $4 billion share repurchase authorization through 2027. As previously announced with our June capital allocation update, we increased our third quarter dividend by approximately 15% to $2 annualized, and intend to follow-through with our guidance of growing our dividend by approximately 10% annually through the end of this decade. This goal should trend us closer to a payout ratio of approximately 20% over time, which will enable us to retain the financial flexibility essential to our comprehensive and balanced long-term capital allocation plan, and disciplined growth objectives. Moving to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we repaid $150 million of outstanding principal of the SBL 2025 notes with cash on hand. We plan to repay the remaining $650 million outstanding principal of these notes with cash on hand ahead of its March 2025 maturity, as we focus our debt pay down within CQP in preparation for financing the SPL expansion project. After repaying the remaining SBL 2025s, we will not have any debt maturing anywhere in the Cheniere complex until the middle of 2026. The rating agencies continue to recognize our progress on the balance sheet. Last week, S&P upwardly revised the ratings outlook at Corpus Christi Holdings, or CCH, to positive. And as noted on our last call, we received our 22nd credit rating upgrade in the third quarter when Fitch upgraded CCH to BBB plus. The continued recognition from the rating agencies is a testament to our team's strategically managing our balance sheet and with regard to these rating agency actions, in particular, reflects the progress achieved on our Stage 3 projects. Speaking of Stage 3, during the quarter, we funded approximately $400 million of CapEx on Stage 3, bringing total spend on the project to over $4.3 billion. With approximately $3 billion in consolidated cash and over $10 billion of overall liquidity throughout the Cheniere complex, we expect to continue equity funding the Stage 3 CapEx, while also remaining active on our buyback program, as we continue to manage down our cash balances, before utilizing the undrawn $3 billion CCH term loan, which we expect to eventually draw in 2025. Turn now to Slide 13, where I will discuss our updated 2024 guidance and initial outlook for 2025. Today, we are raising and tightening our full year 2024 guidance ranges to $6 billion to $6.3 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $3.4 billion to $3.7 billion in distributable cash flow, a $250 million increase to the midpoint as well as tightening of the ranges from $400 million to $300 million or less than 5% of the midpoint of guidance. Our increased guidance is close to equally attributable to optimization activities completed upstream and downstream of our facilities, since the last call, as well as slightly higher production and margins than previously forecast during the quarter and into 4Q. We were also able to tighten the ranges another $100 million, as we are effectively sold out for the balance of this year, reducing the amount of variability in our forecast, in our most contracted year-to-date. That being said, our guidance continues to reflect only contributions from completed or locked-in portfolio optimization activities, as we do not forecast potential contributions from future optimization opportunities, albeit likely more limited this late in the year. And of course, our results could be impacted by the timing of certain cargoes around year end. As noted on prior calls, our DCF could be affected by changes in the tax code, particularly as it relates to the alternative minimum tax and the treatment of certain tax positions related to our unrealized derivatives. These changes could impact the timing and amount of our cash tax payments this year and going forward, but should be immaterial on an NPV basis and not impact our ability to generate over $20 billion of available cash through 2026. And while we do not forecast any contribution to revenues or EBITDA from Stage 3 volumes this year, we continue to target first LNG from Train 1 by year end. Based on the progress achieved to-date, we forecast Train 1 to achieve substantial completion at the end of Q1 or early Q2 next year and Trains 2 and 3 to achieve substantial completion in the second half of the year. With this assumption, we expect to produce approximately 47 million to 48 million tons of LNG in total across our two sites next year, inclusive of forecast Stage 3 volumes and a major maintenance plan at Sabine Pass next year. Though a step change from our 45 million ton run rate across our existing nine trains in operations, the variability is based on uncertainty around specific Stage 3 commissioning and ramp-up schedules, as well as year end timing. Of that 47 million to 48 million tons of production, we forecast over 46 million to over 47 million tons of volume after commissioning, supporting 2025 EBITDA. After accounting for the approximately 43 million tons of long-term contracts already in place, we expect to have over 3 million to over 4 million tons of spot volume available for CMI. The team has been active opportunistically selling some of that 2025 spot volume since our last call, and we currently forecast approximately 2 million to 3 million tons or approximately 100 to 150 TBtu of unsold open capacity in 2025. We therefore also forecast that a $1 change in market margin would impact EBITDA by approximately $100 million to $150 million for the full year. Consistent with previous practice, we intend to provide official 2025 financial guidance on our February call. Looking at curves today, netbacks are averaging around $7 to $8 in 2025. So the timing of our Stage 3 trains coming online and the resulting incremental marketing volumes could drive significant variability in our expected earnings for 2025, as we grow beyond our nine train platform. As a reminder, the Stage 3 trains are being built with a design and technology that is new to us, so the length and extent of the commissioning process is somewhat uncertain. As the initial trains start commissioning, we will gain a better sense on the specific timing of these new volumes and their contribution to our financial results next year. As with the commissioning of our first nine trains, we hope to improve the commissioning process for each subsequent train, by deploying lessons learned. We expect the remaining four mid-scale trains to reach substantial completion in 2026, at which point we have several million tons of new long term contracts starting in 2026 and 2027, keeping our platform over 90% contracted with investment grade counterparties and take-or-pay style, cash flows and averaging approximately 95% contracted through the mid-2030s. Earlier this year, I described 2024, as likely a trough year for EBITDA as all of our long-term contracts supporting the nine train platform had commenced, and international gas prices began to moderate despite spot margins remaining very healthy this year, averaging $8. As Jack mentioned, we still expect this to be the case, as Stage 3 volumes start to hit our P&L in 2025. We remain proud of our team's unrelenting efforts to unlock additional value to support financial metrics well above our nine train run rate guidance this year. Looking ahead to 2025 and beyond, we will continue to leverage the vast competitive advantages afforded by our leading brownfield infrastructure platform in order to enhance the long-term value delivered to shareholders and to continue to supply our customers flexible, reliable and cleaner burning LNG. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions. Hi, Jeremy. It's Zach. I'd start first with the guidance of 47 million to 48 million tons of total production including commissioning and then I mentioned that, we're over 46 million to over 47 million tons of basically P&L production in '25. So it's around million tons, a little less than that in the guidance right now that is commissioning, that's not supporting EBITDA and will offset CapEx. Because Stage 3 is combined with Trains 1, 2, 3, those volumes in terms of the margins on those commissioning volumes will be a mix of spot volumes and of contracted volumes. And that's accounted for when we talk about spot volumes in the P&L for CMI to sell over 3 million to over 4 million tons. But as you think about around 1 million tons or 50 TBtu, we're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars that will help offset CapEx and just be another funding source for us in the coming year. We would hope so, but we won't know, until we see it show up in the actuals. We have a budget that we rigorously go through with the operations team and then we go through with the Board, and we'll be in a position to give you a good range for next year in February in terms of financial guidance. But, when it comes to optimization, we're the second largest operator of LNG in the world and we have a lot of ships that we charter and we buy a lot of gas in this country. So there should be opportunities. But to say, what the quantum is, that would be hard to define ahead of time. In terms of the guidance increase this time, I'd say, I'd split it three ways on the optimization side. Upstream of the plants there were better basis differentials that we just couldn't have forecasted earlier on that were able to be captured. Then we were able to opportunity sub-charter more of our length ahead of Stage 3 coming online for the rest of the year. And then, with some of the positions we have all over the world and a few third-party sourcing, we were able to optimize the portfolio downstream and together that was around $100 million plus added to the guidance. On the production side, honestly that would be hard to forecast ahead of time, considering we had a relatively smooth hurricane season for Cheniere. The ambient temperatures were also lower, and they were able to just outperform at both sites, and honestly pick up from earlier in the year, where production was slightly down. So that alone with $8, $9 margins for the rest of this year added another $100 million plus. So hard to say, we can bake that in, and I would assume in a February guidance we wouldn't be baking that in initially. Sure. Just for a little more clarity, on the high-end if we're going to make it to 48 million tons of production next year. You'd have to assume that Trains 1, 2 and 3 reach substantial completion by the end of Q1, Q2 and Q3 respectively. And then on the lower end where we're closer to 47 million, we have decent visibility on Train 1. So we're hopeful that can still come online in late Q1 or early Q2, but then it would be a little bit later in the second half of the year for Trains 2 and 3 to end up at the 47 million ton level. So ideally we'll have a bit more of an understanding of how things are going by the next call. But even by the next call, we don't expect to have substantial completion of even Train 1. This is Zach. I saw a few notes from folks this morning and I just want to make it clear. As you think about 2025, first and foremost, it's all about the CMI spot capacity. The CMI spot capacity that we guided to is over 3 million to over 4 million tons. Since the call, we were able to be opportunistic and sell some of our 2025 length and we sold over 1 million tons in a market that was trading around $8 at the time for next year. So that's locking-in nicely around a $0.5 billion for the company. That was mainly locking in production from the existing nine trains, just because we have more clarity, more understanding of how those produce over time, whereas it would be very difficult for us to sell physically or even to sell -- hedge financially volumes that are not as certain. So some of those will have to be closer to the date of loading than to be as proactive as we have been. With all that said, Q1 and Q4 will still be our biggest production quarters, just with lower ambient temperatures and the fact that our major maintenance will happen in the summer. Then as you can imagine with the cadence of the trains coming online, at best there will be one train operating in Q2 and then ideally in second half of the year two more come online. So Q2 is probably our lowest level of production for the year. So we might have more confidence going into next year or early next year to start selling at the latter part of the year, as we have more production. But assume we're -- we sold quite a bit already considering it's only October still. Hi, Jean. As you know, we work really closely with the Department of Energy. There's a lot of speculation around which way the pause may head. It's clear to us that, nothing's going to happen until after next week. And then, from that point, it could be -- it's pretty broad bookends, on which way the band could go. So I would wait until next week. But before I give you anything concrete, but I would say that, we are in very, very good shape with 8 and 9. And actually with the Sabine expansion, it's clear that brownfield expansions are going to be treated a lot differently than greenfield expansions going forward. And I think, we're in a really good position to maximize the benefits of our existing platform. I'll go first on the guidance. On the $2 to $2.5, I think we're just trying to make it as clear as possible for you folks, what we see in the run rate and everyone can make their own assumptions considering the balance of this year is at $9 netbacks, next year is $8 year after $6 and even in '27 we're talking about $4 netbacks today. So the fact that with every dollar turn even in the run rate, we're spreading what like $300 million of EBITDA. So we try to give that guidance that way. In terms of SPAs, I'm going to hand it over to Anatol. But basically, we're pushing the limits of that range right now, and that range still works for us specifically on these brownfield expansions, thanks to all the equipment and infrastructure we already have in place. It's a good question for some others that are trying to do greenfield, but for midscale eight to nine, Sabine expansion and everything else we want to do at Corpus and Sabine, we're in a great spot that we can do that still at around 7x CapEx to EBITDA. But, Anatol? Hi, Craig. Thanks for the question. I mean, yes, the cash balance on 9/30 is around $3 billion on a consolidated basis. That was around $4.5 billion going into this year. Considering we've already deployed, I think around $4.2 billion across the four pillars of capital allocation, but year to date DCF is around $2.7 billion that makes about the right sense. You can assume that, we'll be continually deploying probably more than our DCF to work that cash balance down over time. But, as we have this cash balance as margins are more elevated, we're going to use that cash to obviously continue the buyback at a pretty good pace, as well as continue to equity fund Stage 3, which we've done 100% life to date. At some point we'll have that $3 billion of liquidity from that term loan that we can use as just general liquidity for the company and still stay comfortably IG at all the entities. But, in the meantime, it's pretty efficient for us to use this excess cash, work it down, get closer to $1 billion plus at some point next year."

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Randy Bhatia, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nRandy Bhatia: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Cheniere's second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. The slide presentation and access to the webcast for today's call are available at cheniere.com. Joining me this morning are Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO; Anatol Feygin, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Zach Davis, Executive Vice President and CFO; and other members of Cheniere's senior management. Before we begin, I would like to remind all listeners that our remarks, including answers to your questions, may contain forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from what is described in these statements. Slide 2 of our presentation contains a discussion of those forward-looking statements and associated risks. In addition, we may include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the appendix to the slide presentation. As part of our discussion of Cheniere's results, today's call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP, or CQP. We do not intend to cover CQP's results separately from those of Cheniere Energy, Inc. The call agenda is shown on Slide 3. Jack will begin with operating and financial highlights. Anatol will then provide an update on the LNG market, and Zach will review our financial results and increased 2024 guidance. After prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. I will now turn the call over to Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO.\nJack Fusco: Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today as we review our second quarter results which exceeded our expectations, thanks to the success we have achieved across the entire Cheniere platform. Before I address the quarterly results and guidance increase, I hope you saw our contract announcement earlier this week. We have entered into a new long-term SPA with the Portuguese multinational integrated energy company, Galp, for approximately 0.5 million tons for 20 years. And the SPA is tied to the date of the second train of the SPL expansion project. This contract demonstrates not only further progress and continued momentum on the development of the SPL expansion project, but also the important role U.S. LNG fulfills in the European energy system for decades to come. The SPA represents our longest dated contract with the European counterparty as the deal is expected to extend beyond 2050. We continue to be very excited about the market's response to the SPL expansion project and are working diligently across multiple work streams to advance the project towards FID. We are focused on being the world's LNG supplier of choice from the U.S., differentiating ourselves with a safety-first culture, superior reliability and our customer focus that demonstrates our long-term commitment to excellence in LNG operations. Please turn to Slide 5, where I'll highlight our key accomplishments for the quarter and introduce our increased guidance for 2024. In the second quarter, we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.3 billion, distributable cash flow of approximately $700 million and net income of approximately $880 million. These actual financial results are once again the product of our maniacal focus on operational excellence. During the quarter, we produced and exported 155 LNG cargoes from our facilities. Total LNG production across our platform was up slightly year-over-year for both the quarter and the first half of the year. On the maintenance front, during the second quarter, we executed our major maintenance programs at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi, and I'm extremely proud of the outcomes of each of those turnarounds. I'll come back to these programs in a minute. For their safe and successful execution further reinforces our operating track record and sets Cheniere further apart from the competition. During the second quarter, we announced an update to our capital allocation plan highlighted by a $4 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization through 2027, as well as a planned increase in our dividend to $2 per share annualized next quarter. As Zach will speak to further, our capital allocation plan provides investors with an excellent framework in which they can take confidence, a proven, disciplined approach that provides for cash flow visibility, capital management and long-term value creation. Looking ahead to the balance of 2024, today, we are raising and tightening the ranges of our full-year guidance to $5.7 billion to $6.1 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion of distributable cash flow. The primary drivers of the increase our portfolio optimization activities and excellent maintenance execution at both our sites, particularly at Corpus, where we expect to make up some of the lost production we had in the first quarter as a result of freeze-related gas composition issues that I discussed on our last call. Even accounting for the increased volume in the forecast, we continue to have an immaterial amount of unsold volume remaining for the balance of the year. In fact, we will have more to say on the guidance increase in his remarks in a few minutes. Please turn to Slide 6, where I'll update you on the growth at Stage 3 and Trains 8 and 9 at Corpus. On the construction execution side, Bechtel continues to progress our Stage 3 project at Corpus Christi on budget, on accelerated schedule, once again demonstrated that the LNG market, the reliability of execution and visibility on volumes from Cheniere. In June, Stage 3 reached over 62% completion, and the headcount has ramped to about 4,000 construction workers today. As you can see from the photos on the slide, Stage 3 is very much taking shape especially the first few trains for which construction is well advanced. All equipment for the first two trains has been delivered to the project site, and last week, Train 5 coal boxes were shipped and Train 6 coal boxes are ready to ship. We continue to target first LNG from Train 1 by the end of the year and to bring the first three trains online by the end of 2025. To that end, recently, we commenced the process of turning over utility systems from E&C to the commissioning teams with approximately 35 such systems having already been turned over. And in June, Bechtel energized the Train 1 liquefaction and utility substations, a critical step, which will enable power at the project site. In addition, we have begun to make some necessary regulatory filings in preparation for the start of commissioning activities on Train 1. We expect to begin taking first gas into Train 1 in the next couple of months, which will begin the commissioning and startup process and will give us added visibility into the end of the year target for first LNG. Speaking of regulatory matters. During the second quarter, we received a positive environmental assessment from FERC on Corpus Christi Trains 8, 9. This critical regulatory milestone helps to solidify our expected time line for us to be in a position to reach FID on Train 8, 9 in 2025, which should enable us to realize project efficiencies of having Bechtel already outside for Stage 3. Our ability to navigate the numerous regulatory bodies and obtain the required permits has been a key to our success to date and is essential to our growth plans for both Corpus and Sabine. Now turn to Slide 7. We are pleased to cover some highlights of the maintenance program were executed at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi since our last earnings call and how our execution exemplifies Cheniere's cultural foundations of safety and operational excellence. As I've discussed previously, this year's major maintenance work would look a little different than last year's and that we would need extended periods of full outages at either facility. Rather, we would be able to complete our required maintenance programs under shorter outages or while operating at reduced rates, with a net impact to the total annual production from maintenance being about the same as a major SPL turnaround in 2023. Major maintenance was concentrated to being passed last year, whereas this year, we performed major maintenance across both facilities. In the second quarter of Sabine Pass, we conducted a planned major turnaround for Trains 3 and 4. And at Corpus Christi, we completed a turnaround of Train 3 in the second quarter and a turnaround of Train 2 last month. I'm proud to say these turnarounds were all completed on or ahead of schedule, on budget, had zero reportable environmental incidents and most importantly, zero recordable or lost-time injuries. To be clear, we will have major maintenance programs to execute at our sites every year. Maintenance turnarounds are part of our normal operations. So to have these successes on our major annual programs is critical to maintaining and reinforcing our reputation for safe and reliable operations. As many of you know, this is predicted to be a very busy hurricane season, and we have already had a significant storm, Hurricane Beryl, made landfall on the Texas Gulf Coast. In advance of the storm, we activated our hurricane preparedness plans at both facilities. These plans provide for operations risk assessment and mitigation before, during and after a storm event. The storm made landfall south of Houston, right in between Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi. We had uninterrupted safe and reliable production of LNG at both facilities throughout the storm. To that point, on safety, I'd like to recognize the personnel at both sites for having achieved major safety milestones during the quarter that are worthy of acknowledgment and celebration. Corpus Christi surpassed 6 million man-hours worked without a single lost time incident. And Sabine Pass surpassed the 10 million man-hour mark. Those are exceptional achievements and I'd like to congratulate my Cheniere colleagues, at both sites, for a job well done. And finally, before turning the call over, I'd just like to say a brief word relating to the upcoming presidential election. At Cheniere, we have developed, built and operated our assets under multiple administrations across both parties for the last decade plus. We believe our business and our product to be bipartisan, helping achieve policy priorities across the political spectrum. Economic impact, job creation, global decarbonization, energy independence or international trade, Cheniere and our LNG deliver on each and scale. The numerous and significant benefits of our LNG are proven. In addition, our LNG platform consists of assets that we believe will operate for many decades, transcending any single election cycle. We look forward to maintaining our constructive presence and working relationships in Washington regardless of the outcome in November and to continue being a reliable supplier to our customers into the overall global energy balances and energy security. With that, I'll now hand the call over to Anatol to discuss the LNG markets. Thank you all again for your continued support of Cheniere.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9. With the extreme volatility in prices of 2022 now well in the rearview mirror, JKM and TTF were down 24% and 16%, respectively, year-on-year in the second quarter. However, both benchmarks increased during the quarter due to a series of supply averages in LNG facilities in Australia and the U.S., as well as upstream facilities in Norway. These supply disruptions coupled with stronger demand pull from Asia due to a hot early summer and restocking efforts led to TTF and JKM each helping approximately 25% from April lows to June. In the U.S., month-end Henry Hub settlements averaged $1.89 in the second quarter, but prices strengthened with the June contract settling at $2.49 in MMBtu and July at $2.63 as the domestic market absorbs the impact of price-driven production cuts, along with strong early summer cooling demand and the return of Freeport LNG for maintenance. Throughout the quarter, the supply-demand balance remained delicate in the LNG market. Looking at the center charts, global LNG trade growth was constrained by minimal supply growth during the quarter, with Asia's increased demand met by attracting cargoes in the Atlantic Basin via higher prices. This demand pull from Asia is further evidenced by U.S. LNG export flows, which continue to shift from Europe to Asia during the quarter. The growth in global supply was partially offset as Egypt flips back to an LNG importer and other export facilities suffered protracted outages. The limited incremental supply, Aegis consumption growth was primarily dominated by China and India, leaving little volume for relatively new market areas such as Hong Kong, Vietnam, and the Philippines, which actually became our 40th delivery market last week. We expect this seemingly fragile market balance to continue until additional LNG export capacity comes online. Let's address the regional dynamics on the next page. In Asia, LNG imports grew 11% or 6.7 million tons year-on-year in the second quarter. Extreme temperatures across the region listed gas power demand while relatively lower prices in the first quarter and early second quarter spurred spot buying, resulting in significant increases throughout the first half of the year. China's LNG imports grew 16% or 5.2 million tons in the first half of 2024, with a lower growth rate in the second quarter as prices strengthened. A 10% year-on-year increase in the country's overall gas demand in the first half of the year underpin this LNG import growth, particularly when prices were conducive to LNG stock buy. Roughly 1/4 of this gas demand growth was met by pipeline imports consistent with the planned ramp-up in Russian gas deliveries through Power of Siberia. And the remaining 75% of the growth was evenly split between indigenous production and LNG imports. Elsewhere in Asia, India's imports reached over 7 million tons in the second quarter. A 21% increase year-on-year. This growth propelled South and Southeast Asian imports to new highs, resulting in 6.4 million tons or 23% of cumulative growth through the first half of the year. Other markets in the region also saw similar upticks, including Pakistan, Thailand as well as Singapore, we saw increased use of LNG and bunkering operations. This growth in demand resulted in steady competition for cargoes among markets across Asia and sustained the JKM premium over TTF. In Europe, imports were lower by about 13.4 million tons year-on-year in the first half. Despite a modest 5% uptick in industrial sector demand, in the six key markets we track, total gas demand in the region remained 4.3% below the comparable period last year. As shown in the chart on the lower right, strong seasonal generation from hydropower and wind and healthy nuclear power generation suppressed gas-fired power across the key European markets, resulting in an 18% year-on-year drop in gas burn in the first half of the year. In addition, mild temperatures for most of the quarter further limited heating demand. These dynamics enabled Europe to refill storage inventories at just above last year's level. EU gas storage stood at approximately 83% full as of July 20, almost meeting the previous record of 84% set for the comparable period during the pandemic back in 2020. In the absence of weather supported demand in Europe and delays in new LNG facility startups, users demand growth trajectory will likely serve as the main factor impacting availability of LNG to Europe and its storage fill track. Let's move to the next slide for a longer-term perspective. After nearly two full years of focus on Europe and its energy crisis, Asia has in the first half of 2024 regained the spotlight in the LNG marketplace. We believe this rebound is supportive of our long-term market thesis, namely that as the supply curve pushes out into the right and market liquidity continues to increase in the coming years, we will see incremental demand growth in both Europe and Asia. Market analysts agree that Asia remains the primary driver of LNG demand growth over the longer term. As you can see from the chart to the left, we expect Asian demand to nearly double by 2040. So the supply availability is not constrained. However, Europe will still need significant volumes of LNG now and in the long-term and will continue to compete with Asia as domestic production and regional pipe imports continue to decline. As Jack highlighted earlier, we signed a new long-term SPA with Galp, which is expected to extend beyond 2015. Since the beginning of 2022, we have signed over 5 million tons per annum of long-term contracts with European counterparties, who value the reliability and flexibility of our LNG, further reinforcing the long-term role of LNG in Europe's energy mix. On the right side, we delineate expected growth by region. This highlights the growth in Asia is not driven by China alone, but rather spread across numerous markets in Asia, enhancing the durability of growth in the region over the coming decades. On previous calls, we have highlighted the significant growth potential of South and Southeast Asian markets and believe that these stands to particularly benefit from the coming increase in LNG supply, supporting grid stability and ensuring system flexibility and resiliency. Ahead of this supply cycle, we expect the market to continue to balance primarily on the demand side. The expectation of growing supply from 2026 onwards should alleviate the constraints on demand growth, especially as moderate prompt LNG and gas prices prevail. This would help both Europe and Asia, equally, in realizing security of supply as Europe will be better able to meet its requirements to replace Russian gas while backstopping growth in renewables, and Asia will be better equipped to displace coal and offset regional production declines while underpinning investments in gas infrastructure and high-growth developing economies. With that, I'll turn the call over to Zach to review our financial results and guidance.\nZach Davis: Thanks, Anatol, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our second quarter 2024 results, key financial accomplishments and increased guidance for the year. Turning to Slide 13. For the second quarter of 2024, we generated net income of approximately $880 million, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.3 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $700 million. With these second quarter results, we have now reported positive net income on a quarterly and cumulative trailing four-quarter basis, seven quarters in a row. Compared to last year, our second quarter 2024 results reflect a higher proportion of our LNG being sold under long-term contracts as well as further moderation of international gas prices relative to last year. Compared to the first quarter of this year, our production was lower in the second quarter due to the planned maintenance at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi, which Jack detailed, as well as warmer ambient temperatures at Sabine. During the second quarter, we recognized in income, 552 TBtu of physical LNG, all of which was produced by our facilities. Approximately 93% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SPA or IPM agreements with initial terms greater than 10 years, which makes this past quarter our most contracted quarter to date. Thanks to the team's focus on execution and operational excellence, we have generated over $3 billion of consolidated adjusted EBITDA and nearly $2 billion of distributable cash flow in the first half of 2024, boosting our confidence in the increased forecast for the remainder of the year, which I'll address further on the next slide. The strong financial results enabled our team to deploy another approximately $1.2 billion under our comprehensive capital allocation plan towards shareholder returns, balance sheet management and accretive growth during the second quarter alone, bringing total cash deployed towards our 2020 Vision to over $11 billion, with over $3 billion in the first half of 2024. This accelerated progress prompted us to increase our share repurchase authorization by another $4 billion through 2027, along with plans to increase our quarterly dividend by 15% next quarter to $2 per share annualized, as well as extend the dividend's annual growth target going forward of 10% through the decade. These announcements demonstrate continued follow-through of our stated objectives. To deploy at least $20 billion to further reduce share count and enhance capital returns while retaining financial flexibility to fund accretive growth in order to generate over $20 per share of run rate distributable cash flow for our shareholders later this decade. The capital allocation updated view shows a powerful statement about Cheniere's performance, capital allocation to date and our outlook to grow cash flow per share in the future. At the foundation of our 2020 vision plan is our multi-decade fixed fee contracts with investment-grade customers, coupled with our excellence in LNG operations, which gives us significant visibility into the billions of dollars of annual cash flow for the long-term. Perhaps just as important as visibility is flexibility. Maintaining and enhancing our IG ratings and steadily growing the dividend to a reasonable payout over time, provide ideal financial flexibility, which enables us to maintain a robust buyback plan while simultaneously funding accretive brownfield growth within cash flow, which will improve both the numerator and denominator of our run rate DCF per share goals. As Jack mentioned, the capital allocation plan is designed to provide investors with the framework, which they can take confidence, thanks to our cash flow visibility and financial flexibility to enable sustainable long-term value creation. During the second quarter, we repurchased over 3.1 million shares for approximately $500 million, helping bring our total shares outstanding to approximately $226 million today. The buyback program continues to work as designed, deploying allocated capital into the stock, which can increase significantly in periods of sustained dislocation as we saw in the first half. While the amount of shares repurchased in the second quarter trails that of the first quarter, it's important to remember that the first quarter is nearly $1.2 billion of share repurchases, was enabled in part by the accumulation of some cash in the plan over the preceding several quarters, which was unlocked as the stock underperformed in Q1 and into Q2. With the upsized share repurchase authorization commencing at the start of the third quarter, we remain committed in our track to reach our goal of approximately 200 million shares outstanding later this decade and opportunistically complete the upsized $4 billion buyback program by 2027. Moving to the balance sheet. We issued our second investment grade bond at CQP in May. And in June, we used the $1.2 billion of proceeds from the 5.75% senior notes to redeem approximately $1.2 billion of a 5.625% senior secured [indiscernible] due 2027. Consistent with prior issuances, this transaction extends our maturity profile while further desecuring and desubordinating our consolidated balance sheet by moving secured project debt from SPL to unsecured corporate debt at CQP. During the quarter, we also fully retired the 2024 SPL notes, repairing the remaining approximately $150 million of outstanding principle with cash on hand. Over the next few quarters, we'll focus on our debt paydown on the remaining outstanding principle of the SPL 2025 notes, after which point, we will not have any debt maturing until the middle of 2026. The rating agencies continue to recognize our progress on the balance sheet. In May, in conjunction with the CQP issuance, Moody's upgraded both CQP and SPL to Baa2 and Baa1, respectively, representing a double upgrade at CQP. And in July, Fitch upgraded CCH to BBB+. These positive rating actions reflect our balance sheet management to date and our commitment to opportunistically delever and desubordinate going forward as we target long-term leverage of under 4x run rate EBITDA and BBB corporate credit ratings at both LNG and CQP. The Corpus upgrade specifically is also a recognition of the significant progress achieved at Stage 3 today. For the second quarter, we have maintained a dividend of $0.435 per common share. As announced in June, we plan to increase the dividend by 15% to $2 annualized next quarter. Beyond this year, we remain committed to our guidance of growing our dividend by approximately 10% annually, not just through 2026, but through the decade, at which point we'll be at a payout ratio of only about 20%, enabling us to maintain the financial flexibility essential to our comprehensive and balanced long-term capital allocation plan and growth objectives, with investment-grade metrics and internally generated cash flow funding at both Sabine and Corpus. During the quarter, we funded approximately $400 million of CapEx on Stage 3, bringing total unlevered spend on the project to approximately $3.8 billion. Front-loading the equity spend has enabled considerable interest savings, and we still have over $3 billion available on our CCH term loan as additional liquidity for CEI in the coming years through construction. We expect to spend between $1.5 billion to $2 billion in Stage 3 CapEx this year, before accounting for any draws on the CCH term loan. We maintained significant total liquidity in addition to our DCF forecast and therefore, flexibility with almost $3 billion of cash on hand, plus over $3 billion of available term loan at CCH as well as open revolvers across the Cheniere complex. Turning now to Slide 14 where I will discuss our upwardly revised 2024 guidance. Today, we are raising and tightening our full-year 2024 guidance ranges to $5.7 billion to $6.1 billion and consolidated adjusted EBITDA from $5.5 billion to $6 billion, and $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion in distributable cash flow from $2.9 billion to $3.4 billion. Several factors contributed to our improved forecast for the year primarily from additional production layered into the forecast post our turnarounds, as well as optimization activities achieved upstream and downstream of our facilities since the last call. As Jack noted, our maintenance programs not only minimize production impacts to both sites, but also unlock efficiencies at CCL that should offset the impacts to production from the winter storm we experienced in the first quarter into the second half of this year. Of course, we are still in hurricane season on the Gulf Coast, and while we had no impacts to our production from Hurricane Beryl last month. We keep a very close eye on potential hurricane impacts as our expected results could be impacted by future weather events at our sites. However, we decided to tighten the guidance considering we are now more than halfway through the year, we've completed our major maintenance at both sites, and a decent portion of the optimization has been locked in, on top of this being our most contracted year ever on a percentage basis. We still expect to produce approximately 45 million tones of LNG this year, inclusive of the planned maintenance downtime at both sites. And our guidance continues to reflect only contributions from completed or locked in portfolio optimization activities as we do not forecast potential contributions from future optimization opportunities. And of course, our results could be impacted by the timing of certain cargoes around year-end. Our DCF for 2024 could also be affected by changes in the tax code. As noted on prior calls, we qualified for the corporate alternative minimum taxes here. However, upcoming guidance related to the implementation of this tax, which is expected later this year, specifically regarding the taxing of unrealized derivatives, could impact the timing and amount of our cash tax payments this year and going forward. We would expect any impacts to primarily be a matter of timing and should not impact our ability to generate over $20 billion of available cash through 2026. We do not forecast any contribution to revenues or EBITDA from Stage 3 volumes this year. We look forward to updating you on our 2025 volume projections, inclusive of Stage 3 contributions on our Q3 call. We continue to target first LNG at the end of the year and the first 3 trains to reach substantial completion by the end of 2025, reinforcing our view that 2024 is expected to be a trough year and 2025 will begin the step-up of our run rate production above the 9 train 450 mtpa. As we look out beyond the next few years, our conviction in the long-term role of our LNG in global energy markets, and Cheniere's position in it, have only strengthened. At Cheniere, we lead with our safety track record operational and commercial reputation and financial discipline to generate and deploy accretively the billions of dollars to cash flow year after year. We are leveraging all of those advantages to continue to create sustainable and growing long-term value for our shareholders and supply our global customer base with our flexible, reliable and affordable LNG for decades to come. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTheresa Chen: Good morning. With the progress we've made year-to-date, would you be able to provide any additional color on the drivers that underlie the low versus high end of the updated guidance range?\nZach Davis: Sure. Thanks, Theresa. This is Zach. I'd say going into the last call, we are already tracking to the upper half of the range. So we were in a good position. And now we're able to not only raise it, but tied in it by $200 million on the low end. So at this point, we're comfortably in the middle of the range, if not better. And the reason for that is that there was probably another incremental $100 million added to the EBITDA, thanks to production going up post the major maintenance at Corpus, helping Corpus catch up from some of the feed gas quality issues that it had in Q1. And then just more optimization across the board from upstream and downstream and sub chartering. So to go from there, there's still a little variability. We won't account for most of the optimization that could happen in the second half of the year, in particular on the upstream side on basis differentials. And then Henry Hub is a variable just on lifing margin. Every $0.50 move in Henry Hub probably affects our lifting margin and EBITDA by about $30 million still for the rest of the year. And then we're still in a hurricane season. So weather permitting, if things go smoothly as they have gone to date, maybe there will be some incremental production. And if not, we could also lose some production if we have incremental downtime above and beyond what we normally budget or give ourselves coverage for. And then there's a little variability at the end of the year just on year-end timing of deliveries. We don't bake into the forecast late deliveries in the year. So that might add out a bit, but shouldn't materially affect us on the downside. So things are pretty big this year as it was already our most contracted year ever.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you for that detailed answer. And maybe turning into the permitting side. I would love to get your updated view on the regulatory and permitting landscape. Specifically, what industry read-throughs, if any, are there to glean from the DC focus recent decision to vacate for permits that a couple of competitor projects amid environmental opposition? And what is your view on the permitting process for your own expansion projects?\nJack Fusco: Thanks, Theresa. This is Jack. I'll take a crack at that one. So first, a similar outcome can't happen with our permits at SPL on Trains 1 through 6 or CCL 1 through 3, including Stage 3 at CCL because all of our permits are no longer subject to appeal. On our expansion projects, which is CCL 8, 9 and SPL Stage 5. As you all know, we dedicated a significant amount of time and resources just developing our projects and associated permit applications in a manner that we feel satisfies the federal, state, local regulatory requirements. And we've done this over the course of more than a decade through multiple administrations, and we feel very confident in our ability to continue to perform that way. There's a significant amount of work that we do with the regulators to ensure that we have a robust record underpinning all of our permits, and we're thoughtful and accurately responding to their information request as well as comments from affected stakeholders. And that's what you see happening right now for 8 and 9 with all of our public hearings that we listened to the neighborhood. We listened to their concerns with EJ or air quality, and we respond appropriately to those concerns. So I feel very good about our position versus what we saw transpire with some of the other folks in the LNG industry.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Jerry Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi. It's Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Good morning all.\nZach Davis: Hey, Jeremy.\nJack Fusco: Hey, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to touch on commercial discussions. Great to see the Galp contract earlier. And just wanted to see, I guess, how the state of commercial discussions are going with customers right now, given changes in the LNG market and especially the impact of competitor delays out there? The pause, election uncertainty. Just wondering how these things all come together to impact, I guess, commercial discussions for SPL expansion at this point?\nAnatol Feygin: Hey, Jeremy. It's Anatol. Thanks for the question. No great fireworks, a very similar answer to last few quarters. Obviously, after 2022, 2023, there's a period of reassessing, digesting, thinking through portfolios. But in your question and partially in Jack and Zack's answers, we have continued to differentiate ourselves from a reliability standpoint, from a commercial behavior standpoint. And as we've said, we expect the engagement to bear fruit that very much rhymes with what you've seen in the past. I cannot tell you, even with TTF rallying back into the \u20ac40 range, kind of highest levels year-to-date. I still don't expect a rush of European long-term counterparties. We've always said that there will be opportunities, 5 million tons that we've done to date, including Galp, but the drivers will continue to be Asian demand growth and North American production growth, and those discussions are healthy. They appreciate the differentiation. They appreciate the \u2013 Theresa's question on how we navigate various uncertainties. And I think all of those are tailwinds for the commercial team.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful there. And was wondering if we could turn to capital allocation for a minute. And it's good to see the dividend increase there. I was just wondering if you could talk a bit more, I guess, on the size of the step-up at that point versus more versus less? And how that influences your thought process going forward?\nZach Davis: Sure. This is Zach. And obviously, everything we do needs to go through and be approved by the Board before we announce it. But let's put it this way, $4 billion isn't going to be it. And 200 million shares outstanding isn\u2019t our final target. So we're going to just continue to work it down. And we needed this right now follow through on the 2020 vision. And getting to that point, we're on a run rate sustainable basis even at $2 margins, not like the $7, $8 margins we're seeing on the screen for the next 1.5 years. We're comfortably in the 20s on DCF per share. But how we look at it? That $4 billion should get us pretty close to 200 million shares really just depends on share price. And then we look at our cash flow forecast and ensure that we can meet those commitments of finishing a $4 billion incremental buyback program by 2027 or sooner with on top of that, being balanced on our capital allocation and achieving all the other goals we want to achieve, which is not just finishing up Stage 3 in 2025 and 2026, but FID and the expansion there and getting Sabine ready, having the balance sheet get to BBB across the board by being proactive on that. And obviously, we increased the dividend by 15% and committed to a 10% growth rate for the rest of the decade. So a balance of all of that is how we got to $4 billion, but I wouldn't think too much about that because we've been known to increase it over time.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you for that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJohn Mackay: Hey. Thanks for the time. This is probably one for Anatol. You guys have been pretty positive on the demand picture for a while now. I'd just be curious to hear a little more from you on if we're looking at your outlook for Asia demand, how sensitive this could be to kind of like the broader macro cycle, we've seen China a little slower recently. Maybe just a little sensitivity there versus, I think, your argument on a lot of this is kind of baked in growth at this point? Thanks.\nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, John. Again, very boring really hasn't changed much. We see the dedication to gas writ large being very sustained and durable across Asia. And across Europe, in fact, right, the investments that are being made, the \u2013 we're going to approach something like 1,500 million tons of re-gas capacity by the time all is said and done. And, yes, there is some price sensitivity in some markets, but actually, we've been pleasantly surprised at, A) at what levels and B), how much seemingly price inelastic demand in the short-term is manifesting itself. So we see these emerging markets in South and Southeast Asia as being very hungry for gas. It still is going to be a very small piece of their primary energy mix and will perform a lot of grid reliability and balancing functions that modern grids expect. So continue to be just as constructive. In fact, what we're seeing now, as we touched on, is a supply-constrained market, and everything we've seen play out in North America and the rest of the world, again, just like in previous cycles, continues to move that supply constraint further and further out. And you're seeing kind of 2026, 2027 now being the period of that supply entering the market as opposed to a year ago when most were penciling it in 12 to 18 months earlier. So we think as that supply comes in, you'll see some very dramatic growth numbers as various economies avail themselves of this moderately priced and reliable resource.\nJohn Mackay: That's great. Appreciate that. Maybe just for my second one, with the Galp deal announced and you guys kind of continuing to make progress on some of the expansion projects. Can you just remind us kind of what you're thinking about in terms of what you have now and targets you'd like to get to for the 2 incremental Corpus trains and then the broader Sabine expansion?\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Maybe I'll start and tag team with Zach. But in terms of quantum of commercial support, we're right around 10 million tons. We've got about just under 3 million tons with three customers that are [indiscernible] to the mid-scale expansion. And with Galp, about seven kind of beyond that. So as always, we're navigating all of the levers, commercial, of course, being one of them to think about what the right way to get to the appropriate project is.\nZach Davis: And I'll just add with all the success that the team that the origination team has had in the last year or two, if we wanted to be \u2013 we could be 100% contracted even with the mid-scale expansion of 8 to 9 and debottlenecking. That's how many contracts we have. So we're in a really good spot where \u2013 now with the EA at Corpus for midscale 8 and 9 targeting FID next year once we have the permits and we can make that fully contracted. And with the contract at Galp and everything else that we've signed tied to Train 7 or Train 8, we have more than enough to even FID in a couple of years or so, a first phase of a Sabine expansion. So that's in mind too, as we continue to do value engineering there and work on it with Bechtel.\nJohn Mackay: All right. Appreciate the time. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll move to our next caller, Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is open.\nBenjamin Nolan: Yes. I appreciate it. Thanks. I wanted to maybe start with the cost side. We saw I guess, earlier this week, Bechtel come out with a new EPC contract and appreciating that it's \u2013 there's probably some differences. But I was curious if that sort of came in line with how you're thinking about the expansions that you're working on and contemplated with the pricing of the gas that you've sold?\nZach Davis: I'll answer that. And we can't speak for what's going on at these other projects, obviously. And it doesn't really matter because if we're not going to hit our financial standard, why are we going to take undue risk and dilute the returns that we're already providing to all our shareholders. That we can easily get by just buying back more stock and letting investors own more Sabine and Corpus already in place. So that's their brownfield like best, I guess, and that's for them to figure out. Whereas for us, we think we can do even better. And that will allow us to achieve 7x CapEx to EBITDA, 10% unlevered returns. And that's just contracted nothing more than 225 on CMI and a fully wrapped EPC. Anything beyond that in terms of early completion, higher CMI levels, optimization, that's just upside to us all, but never baked in when we FID these projects.\nBenjamin Nolan: Okay. Maybe another way to ask that is, to the extent that you got similar pricing, the math still works fine. Like is that maybe in a different way to get to the same place?\nZach Davis: Working with Bechtel, clearly now thinking about limited notices to proceed even later this year and then to be in a position to have full notice to proceed next year. We have a decent sense of where pricing is shaking out, especially for 9, and it's all looking good.\nBenjamin Nolan: Perfect. And then sort of a follow-up or a second question. I appreciate your comments on the FERC thing is going on. But as you're getting closer to Corpus Christi, any updated thoughts on the DOE non-FDA? Any sense as to if we're getting closer to an unpause there?\nAnatol Feygin: No. I think you, Ben, you probably have seen that they filed an appeal on the ban \u2013 of the ban. I think, again, this is probably is not going to get settled until after November. But it's not going to impact what we do here at Cheniere.\nBenjamin Nolan: Got it. All right, I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll move to our next question from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Go ahead, sir.\nKeith Stanley: Hi. Good morning. Just one question. Can you touch on potential plans to add gas power plant capacity with your old friends at Calpine under the Texas loan program? Just strategic rationale for that cost and what you're hoping to achieve?\nJack Fusco: Thanks, Keith. So as you know, with our Stage 3 increase at Corpus. Our demand for electricity increases dramatically. Because those are electric compression, not gas compressors. So we wanted to manage that risk. We were able to do that very efficiently and effectively and cheaply by buying an existing power plant that was on the outskirts of our site. That's the old GPP plant. And we have partnered with Calpine to make that a reliable combined cycle power plant, which they've done a very good job at to date. The plant has run almost every day since we bought it last year, very efficiently and reliably, but it's our intent to grow that facility to match our demand profile. And in that way, it will be a financial hedge to our power exposure at Corpus Christi. So that's the intent of the relationship with Calpine and our ownership in that power plant. And as you also know, we own our own power plant at Sabine Pass that's not connected to the grid, but we have power generating facilities there already. So we're perfectly comfortable with owning and operating those facilities.\nKeith Stanley: That make sense. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nCraig Shere: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just one for me. Sounds like your debottlenecking is making a lot more progress. It's obviously been going on for years. Barring a hurricane risk, is it fair to say that your average multiyear legacy train output is already notably and systemically over 5 mtpa at this point? And what would it take for you to guide to something higher in the coming quarters?\nZach Davis: I guess we should have expected that question from you. But I'll just say \u2013 we've been at around 5 million tons per train on the first 9 trains for a while, and now we're still at 5 million tons per train. And we're doing major maintenance every year. So for the next few years, hard to see that moving materially up. But we are making investments. We've mentioned before, things like fin fans that should eventually help us get closer to the higher end of that range. But not yet. We're not in the business of overpromising on this.\nJack Fusco: Craig, I was going to say as soon as we get comfortable that we can reliably meet the production numbers over a 20-year period, we will let you know.\nCraig Shere: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Zack Van Everen with TPH. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nZack Van Everen: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to start on the global demand outlook. I know you talked about it on the last call around data centers internationally. We've seen some positive developments here in the U.S. on the midstream side. Has anything come up or anything changed there as far as conversations with potential customers or just increased demand from the global kind of AI data center demand ramp?\nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Thanks, Zach. It's Anatol. There are \u2013 we're, let's say, roughly two steps away from that. But clearly, this is a very nice tailwind for that Asian story as well. We see a dedicated kind of hyperscaler commitments to Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, other markets where we are working with our counterparts who will ultimately be supplying into that demand. So it is another component of the electrification and the reliability that the grids need that will be driven by this additional gas supply, and it is a component in the global story. But again, we are not the load serving entity, right? So we're a step or two removed from that.\nZack Van Everen: Got it. That makes sense. And then maybe one on the U.S. kind of gas macro side. You mentioned that Stage 3 will start taking feed gas in the next few months. Can you give an idea of the volumes there? Is it a couple of 100 MMcf a day or a little bit less than that as you start to commission that first train?\nJack Fusco: Yes. Zach, the way that works is it will be small first as we dry out the internal piping and the compression, and we continue to test things. And then it will grow \u2013 should grow significantly after that. And our \u2013 the pipeline that provides the gas from AGUA DOCE into Stage 3 is already in operations.\nZack Van Everen: Got it. That makes sense. I appreciate the time, guys. Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Blum: Thanks for squeezing me in here. I just had one question left here. Just in terms of the operational enhancements you talked about, which led to your increased 2024 guidance. I just wanted to confirm that these carry forward to future years? Or is there anything kind of onetime in nature to the second half boost in production? Thanks.\nZach Davis: I would say no commitment yet for the future years. If we go back to the May call, we basically said that production was a little light compared to forecast because after the freeze, we had some feed gas quality issues at Corpus, but we more than made up with it, with the optimization, we were able to do upstream and downstream in the plan. We have more upstream and downstream optimization and subchartering added to the forecast this time around. But on top of that, we're catching back up to where we thought we would be and closer to target for the full year. So hard to say that this is going to be a benefit for the future, but maybe more \u2013 allow us to be more solid on the forecast going forward.\nMichael Blum: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll move to our next question from Manav Gupta with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nManav Gupta: Thank you for squeezing me in. I have one quick question. CCL Stage 3 is about 62.4% complete, was about, I think, 55.9% last quarter. Is that a good run rate? That's how we should think it comes online? Or it can get very lumpy because of the construction phase kicking in? Thank you.\nJack Fusco: Yes. So there's really \u2013 that's an overall construction completion date or percentage. And what I like to look at is Trains 1 and 2 and 3. And those numbers are significantly different, as you could see from the photos that we've provided you. But there's really three things that I look at. One is supply chain, do we have all the parts that we need, at least for the initial 3 to 5 trains. And yes. And so we don't \u2013 I'm not worried about supply chain messing the up. The next thing is we look at worker availability. And if are we adding the workforce that we need with the right skills that we need to hit the critical path of the schedule, and we are. And then thirdly, I look at commissioning activities. Are we turning over systems from E&C construction to commissioning and getting those systems started up? And how many employees, operations employees have been seconded to Bechtel. And we have \u2013 at this point, we have about 50 operators that are seconded that are doing commissioning activities. Those are all really positive signs to me that Stage 3 Trains 1, 2 and 3 are really moving along very well.\nManav Gupta: Thank you so much.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Alexander Bidwell from Webber Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAlexander Bidwell: Good morning. This is Alex Bidwell on for Greg this quarter. Thanks for taking my question. Looking at CCL Stage 3. So first LNG on Q1 is coming or is expected at the end of the year. Can you guys define first LNG? Are we talking a substantial volume or a small volume, say, a few cubic meters?\nJack Fusco: We're not in as to play games. We're in it to run a real business. And when we tell you we've achieved first LNG, hopefully, after a decade of doing this in 3700 tankers under my belt that you all believe us that where they're making LNG. So I'm not going to try to define it. I hope that I've earned some credibility with all of you over at least my last eight years in Cheniere's last 10.\nAlexander Bidwell: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session on today's call. I will now turn the call back to the Cheniere team.\nJack Fusco: Thank you all very much for your support and please be safe out there.\nOperator: And this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. And have a great day.",

            "name": "Anatol Feygin",
            "content": "Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9. With the extreme volatility in prices of 2022 now well in the rearview mirror, JKM and TTF were down 24% and 16%, respectively, year-on-year in the second quarter. However, both benchmarks increased during the quarter due to a series of supply averages in LNG facilities in Australia and the U.S., as well as upstream facilities in Norway. These supply disruptions coupled with stronger demand pull from Asia due to a hot early summer and restocking efforts led to TTF and JKM each helping approximately 25% from April lows to June. In the U.S., month-end Henry Hub settlements averaged $1.89 in the second quarter, but prices strengthened with the June contract settling at $2.49 in MMBtu and July at $2.63 as the domestic market absorbs the impact of price-driven production cuts, along with strong early summer cooling demand and the return of Freeport LNG for maintenance. Throughout the quarter, the supply-demand balance remained delicate in the LNG market. Looking at the center charts, global LNG trade growth was constrained by minimal supply growth during the quarter, with Asia's increased demand met by attracting cargoes in the Atlantic Basin via higher prices. This demand pull from Asia is further evidenced by U.S. LNG export flows, which continue to shift from Europe to Asia during the quarter. The growth in global supply was partially offset as Egypt flips back to an LNG importer and other export facilities suffered protracted outages. The limited incremental supply, Aegis consumption growth was primarily dominated by China and India, leaving little volume for relatively new market areas such as Hong Kong, Vietnam, and the Philippines, which actually became our 40th delivery market last week. We expect this seemingly fragile market balance to continue until additional LNG export capacity comes online. Let's address the regional dynamics on the next page. In Asia, LNG imports grew 11% or 6.7 million tons year-on-year in the second quarter. Extreme temperatures across the region listed gas power demand while relatively lower prices in the first quarter and early second quarter spurred spot buying, resulting in significant increases throughout the first half of the year. China's LNG imports grew 16% or 5.2 million tons in the first half of 2024, with a lower growth rate in the second quarter as prices strengthened. A 10% year-on-year increase in the country's overall gas demand in the first half of the year underpin this LNG import growth, particularly when prices were conducive to LNG stock buy. Roughly 1/4 of this gas demand growth was met by pipeline imports consistent with the planned ramp-up in Russian gas deliveries through Power of Siberia. And the remaining 75% of the growth was evenly split between indigenous production and LNG imports. Elsewhere in Asia, India's imports reached over 7 million tons in the second quarter. A 21% increase year-on-year. This growth propelled South and Southeast Asian imports to new highs, resulting in 6.4 million tons or 23% of cumulative growth through the first half of the year. Other markets in the region also saw similar upticks, including Pakistan, Thailand as well as Singapore, we saw increased use of LNG and bunkering operations. This growth in demand resulted in steady competition for cargoes among markets across Asia and sustained the JKM premium over TTF. In Europe, imports were lower by about 13.4 million tons year-on-year in the first half. Despite a modest 5% uptick in industrial sector demand, in the six key markets we track, total gas demand in the region remained 4.3% below the comparable period last year. As shown in the chart on the lower right, strong seasonal generation from hydropower and wind and healthy nuclear power generation suppressed gas-fired power across the key European markets, resulting in an 18% year-on-year drop in gas burn in the first half of the year. In addition, mild temperatures for most of the quarter further limited heating demand. These dynamics enabled Europe to refill storage inventories at just above last year's level. EU gas storage stood at approximately 83% full as of July 20, almost meeting the previous record of 84% set for the comparable period during the pandemic back in 2020. In the absence of weather supported demand in Europe and delays in new LNG facility startups, users demand growth trajectory will likely serve as the main factor impacting availability of LNG to Europe and its storage fill track. Let's move to the next slide for a longer-term perspective. After nearly two full years of focus on Europe and its energy crisis, Asia has in the first half of 2024 regained the spotlight in the LNG marketplace. We believe this rebound is supportive of our long-term market thesis, namely that as the supply curve pushes out into the right and market liquidity continues to increase in the coming years, we will see incremental demand growth in both Europe and Asia. Market analysts agree that Asia remains the primary driver of LNG demand growth over the longer term. As you can see from the chart to the left, we expect Asian demand to nearly double by 2040. So the supply availability is not constrained. However, Europe will still need significant volumes of LNG now and in the long-term and will continue to compete with Asia as domestic production and regional pipe imports continue to decline. As Jack highlighted earlier, we signed a new long-term SPA with Galp, which is expected to extend beyond 2015. Since the beginning of 2022, we have signed over 5 million tons per annum of long-term contracts with European counterparties, who value the reliability and flexibility of our LNG, further reinforcing the long-term role of LNG in Europe's energy mix. On the right side, we delineate expected growth by region. This highlights the growth in Asia is not driven by China alone, but rather spread across numerous markets in Asia, enhancing the durability of growth in the region over the coming decades. On previous calls, we have highlighted the significant growth potential of South and Southeast Asian markets and believe that these stands to particularly benefit from the coming increase in LNG supply, supporting grid stability and ensuring system flexibility and resiliency. Ahead of this supply cycle, we expect the market to continue to balance primarily on the demand side. The expectation of growing supply from 2026 onwards should alleviate the constraints on demand growth, especially as moderate prompt LNG and gas prices prevail. This would help both Europe and Asia, equally, in realizing security of supply as Europe will be better able to meet its requirements to replace Russian gas while backstopping growth in renewables, and Asia will be better equipped to displace coal and offset regional production declines while underpinning investments in gas infrastructure and high-growth developing economies. With that, I'll turn the call over to Zach to review our financial results and guidance. Hey, Jeremy. It's Anatol. Thanks for the question. No great fireworks, a very similar answer to last few quarters. Obviously, after 2022, 2023, there's a period of reassessing, digesting, thinking through portfolios. But in your question and partially in Jack and Zack's answers, we have continued to differentiate ourselves from a reliability standpoint, from a commercial behavior standpoint.

            "name": "Jack Fusco",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today as we review our second quarter results which exceeded our expectations, thanks to the success we have achieved across the entire Cheniere platform. Before I address the quarterly results and guidance increase, I hope you saw our contract announcement earlier this week. We have entered into a new long-term SPA with the Portuguese multinational integrated energy company, Galp, for approximately 0.5 million tons for 20 years. And the SPA is tied to the date of the second train of the SPL expansion project. This contract demonstrates not only further progress and continued momentum on the development of the SPL expansion project, but also the important role U.S. LNG fulfills in the European energy system for decades to come. The SPA represents our longest dated contract with the European counterparty as the deal is expected to extend beyond 2050. We continue to be very excited about the market's response to the SPL expansion project and are working diligently across multiple work streams to advance the project towards FID. We are focused on being the world's LNG supplier of choice from the U.S., differentiating ourselves with a safety-first culture, superior reliability and our customer focus that demonstrates our long-term commitment to excellence in LNG operations. Please turn to Slide 5, where I'll highlight our key accomplishments for the quarter and introduce our increased guidance for 2024. In the second quarter, we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.3 billion, distributable cash flow of approximately $700 million and net income of approximately $880 million. These actual financial results are once again the product of our maniacal focus on operational excellence. During the quarter, we produced and exported 155 LNG cargoes from our facilities. Total LNG production across our platform was up slightly year-over-year for both the quarter and the first half of the year. On the maintenance front, during the second quarter, we executed our major maintenance programs at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi, and I'm extremely proud of the outcomes of each of those turnarounds. I'll come back to these programs in a minute. For their safe and successful execution further reinforces our operating track record and sets Cheniere further apart from the competition. During the second quarter, we announced an update to our capital allocation plan highlighted by a $4 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization through 2027, as well as a planned increase in our dividend to $2 per share annualized next quarter. As Zach will speak to further, our capital allocation plan provides investors with an excellent framework in which they can take confidence, a proven, disciplined approach that provides for cash flow visibility, capital management and long-term value creation. Looking ahead to the balance of 2024, today, we are raising and tightening the ranges of our full-year guidance to $5.7 billion to $6.1 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion of distributable cash flow. The primary drivers of the increase our portfolio optimization activities and excellent maintenance execution at both our sites, particularly at Corpus, where we expect to make up some of the lost production we had in the first quarter as a result of freeze-related gas composition issues that I discussed on our last call. Even accounting for the increased volume in the forecast, we continue to have an immaterial amount of unsold volume remaining for the balance of the year. In fact, we will have more to say on the guidance increase in his remarks in a few minutes. Please turn to Slide 6, where I'll update you on the growth at Stage 3 and Trains 8 and 9 at Corpus. On the construction execution side, Bechtel continues to progress our Stage 3 project at Corpus Christi on budget, on accelerated schedule, once again demonstrated that the LNG market, the reliability of execution and visibility on volumes from Cheniere. In June, Stage 3 reached over 62% completion, and the headcount has ramped to about 4,000 construction workers today. As you can see from the photos on the slide, Stage 3 is very much taking shape especially the first few trains for which construction is well advanced. All equipment for the first two trains has been delivered to the project site, and last week, Train 5 coal boxes were shipped and Train 6 coal boxes are ready to ship. We continue to target first LNG from Train 1 by the end of the year and to bring the first three trains online by the end of 2025. To that end, recently, we commenced the process of turning over utility systems from E&C to the commissioning teams with approximately 35 such systems having already been turned over. And in June, Bechtel energized the Train 1 liquefaction and utility substations, a critical step, which will enable power at the project site. In addition, we have begun to make some necessary regulatory filings in preparation for the start of commissioning activities on Train 1. We expect to begin taking first gas into Train 1 in the next couple of months, which will begin the commissioning and startup process and will give us added visibility into the end of the year target for first LNG. Speaking of regulatory matters. During the second quarter, we received a positive environmental assessment from FERC on Corpus Christi Trains 8, 9. This critical regulatory milestone helps to solidify our expected time line for us to be in a position to reach FID on Train 8, 9 in 2025, which should enable us to realize project efficiencies of having Bechtel already outside for Stage 3. Our ability to navigate the numerous regulatory bodies and obtain the required permits has been a key to our success to date and is essential to our growth plans for both Corpus and Sabine. Now turn to Slide 7. We are pleased to cover some highlights of the maintenance program were executed at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi since our last earnings call and how our execution exemplifies Cheniere's cultural foundations of safety and operational excellence. As I've discussed previously, this year's major maintenance work would look a little different than last year's and that we would need extended periods of full outages at either facility. Rather, we would be able to complete our required maintenance programs under shorter outages or while operating at reduced rates, with a net impact to the total annual production from maintenance being about the same as a major SPL turnaround in 2023. Major maintenance was concentrated to being passed last year, whereas this year, we performed major maintenance across both facilities. In the second quarter of Sabine Pass, we conducted a planned major turnaround for Trains 3 and 4. And at Corpus Christi, we completed a turnaround of Train 3 in the second quarter and a turnaround of Train 2 last month. I'm proud to say these turnarounds were all completed on or ahead of schedule, on budget, had zero reportable environmental incidents and most importantly, zero recordable or lost-time injuries. To be clear, we will have major maintenance programs to execute at our sites every year. Maintenance turnarounds are part of our normal operations. So to have these successes on our major annual programs is critical to maintaining and reinforcing our reputation for safe and reliable operations. As many of you know, this is predicted to be a very busy hurricane season, and we have already had a significant storm, Hurricane Beryl, made landfall on the Texas Gulf Coast. In advance of the storm, we activated our hurricane preparedness plans at both facilities. These plans provide for operations risk assessment and mitigation before, during and after a storm event. The storm made landfall south of Houston, right in between Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi. We had uninterrupted safe and reliable production of LNG at both facilities throughout the storm. To that point, on safety, I'd like to recognize the personnel at both sites for having achieved major safety milestones during the quarter that are worthy of acknowledgment and celebration. Corpus Christi surpassed 6 million man-hours worked without a single lost time incident. And Sabine Pass surpassed the 10 million man-hour mark. Those are exceptional achievements and I'd like to congratulate my Cheniere colleagues, at both sites, for a job well done. And finally, before turning the call over, I'd just like to say a brief word relating to the upcoming presidential election. At Cheniere, we have developed, built and operated our assets under multiple administrations across both parties for the last decade plus. We believe our business and our product to be bipartisan, helping achieve policy priorities across the political spectrum. Economic impact, job creation, global decarbonization, energy independence or international trade, Cheniere and our LNG deliver on each and scale. The numerous and significant benefits of our LNG are proven. In addition, our LNG platform consists of assets that we believe will operate for many decades, transcending any single election cycle. We look forward to maintaining our constructive presence and working relationships in Washington regardless of the outcome in November and to continue being a reliable supplier to our customers into the overall global energy balances and energy security. With that, I'll now hand the call over to Anatol to discuss the LNG markets. Thank you all again for your continued support of Cheniere. Thanks, Theresa. This is Jack. I'll take a crack at that one. So first, a similar outcome can't happen with our permits at SPL on Trains 1 through 6 or CCL 1 through 3, including Stage 3 at CCL because all of our permits are no longer subject to appeal. On our expansion projects, which is CCL 8, 9 and SPL Stage 5. As you all know, we dedicated a significant amount of time and resources just developing our projects and associated permit applications in a manner that we feel satisfies the federal, state, local regulatory requirements. And we've done this over the course of more than a decade through multiple administrations, and we feel very confident in our ability to continue to perform that way. There's a significant amount of work that we do with the regulators to ensure that we have a robust record underpinning all of our permits, and we're thoughtful and accurately responding to their information request as well as comments from affected stakeholders. And that's what you see happening right now for 8 and 9 with all of our public hearings that we listened to the neighborhood. We listened to their concerns with EJ or air quality, and we respond appropriately to those concerns. So I feel very good about our position versus what we saw transpire with some of the other folks in the LNG industry. Hey, Jeremy. Thanks, Keith. So as you know, with our Stage 3 increase at Corpus. Our demand for electricity increases dramatically. Because those are electric compression, not gas compressors. So we wanted to manage that risk. We were able to do that very efficiently and effectively and cheaply by buying an existing power plant that was on the outskirts of our site. That's the old GPP plant. And we have partnered with Calpine to make that a reliable combined cycle power plant, which they've done a very good job at to date. The plant has run almost every day since we bought it last year, very efficiently and reliably, but it's our intent to grow that facility to match our demand profile. And in that way, it will be a financial hedge to our power exposure at Corpus Christi. So that's the intent of the relationship with Calpine and our ownership in that power plant. And as you also know, we own our own power plant at Sabine Pass that's not connected to the grid, but we have power generating facilities there already. So we're perfectly comfortable with owning and operating those facilities. Craig, I was going to say as soon as we get comfortable that we can reliably meet the production numbers over a 20-year period, we will let you know. Yes. Zach, the way that works is it will be small first as we dry out the internal piping and the compression, and we continue to test things. And then it will grow \u2013 should grow significantly after that. And our \u2013 the pipeline that provides the gas from AGUA DOCE into Stage 3 is already in operations. Yes. So there's really \u2013 that's an overall construction completion date or percentage. And what I like to look at is Trains 1 and 2 and 3. And those numbers are significantly different, as you could see from the photos that we've provided you. But there's really three things that I look at. One is supply chain, do we have all the parts that we need, at least for the initial 3 to 5 trains. And yes. And so we don't \u2013 I'm not worried about supply chain messing the up. The next thing is we look at worker availability. And if are we adding the workforce that we need with the right skills that we need to hit the critical path of the schedule, and we are. And then thirdly, I look at commissioning activities. Are we turning over systems from E&C construction to commissioning and getting those systems started up? And how many employees, operations employees have been seconded to Bechtel. And we have \u2013 at this point, we have about 50 operators that are seconded that are doing commissioning activities. Those are all really positive signs to me that Stage 3 Trains 1, 2 and 3 are really moving along very well. We're not in as to play games. We're in it to run a real business. And when we tell you we've achieved first LNG, hopefully, after a decade of doing this in 3700 tankers under my belt that you all believe us that where they're making LNG. So I'm not going to try to define it. I hope that I've earned some credibility with all of you over at least my last eight years in Cheniere's last 10. Thank you all very much for your support and please be safe out there."

            "name": "Zach Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Anatol, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our second quarter 2024 results, key financial accomplishments and increased guidance for the year. Turning to Slide 13. For the second quarter of 2024, we generated net income of approximately $880 million, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.3 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $700 million. With these second quarter results, we have now reported positive net income on a quarterly and cumulative trailing four-quarter basis, seven quarters in a row. Compared to last year, our second quarter 2024 results reflect a higher proportion of our LNG being sold under long-term contracts as well as further moderation of international gas prices relative to last year. Compared to the first quarter of this year, our production was lower in the second quarter due to the planned maintenance at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi, which Jack detailed, as well as warmer ambient temperatures at Sabine. During the second quarter, we recognized in income, 552 TBtu of physical LNG, all of which was produced by our facilities. Approximately 93% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SPA or IPM agreements with initial terms greater than 10 years, which makes this past quarter our most contracted quarter to date. Thanks to the team's focus on execution and operational excellence, we have generated over $3 billion of consolidated adjusted EBITDA and nearly $2 billion of distributable cash flow in the first half of 2024, boosting our confidence in the increased forecast for the remainder of the year, which I'll address further on the next slide. The strong financial results enabled our team to deploy another approximately $1.2 billion under our comprehensive capital allocation plan towards shareholder returns, balance sheet management and accretive growth during the second quarter alone, bringing total cash deployed towards our 2020 Vision to over $11 billion, with over $3 billion in the first half of 2024. This accelerated progress prompted us to increase our share repurchase authorization by another $4 billion through 2027, along with plans to increase our quarterly dividend by 15% next quarter to $2 per share annualized, as well as extend the dividend's annual growth target going forward of 10% through the decade. These announcements demonstrate continued follow-through of our stated objectives. To deploy at least $20 billion to further reduce share count and enhance capital returns while retaining financial flexibility to fund accretive growth in order to generate over $20 per share of run rate distributable cash flow for our shareholders later this decade. The capital allocation updated view shows a powerful statement about Cheniere's performance, capital allocation to date and our outlook to grow cash flow per share in the future. At the foundation of our 2020 vision plan is our multi-decade fixed fee contracts with investment-grade customers, coupled with our excellence in LNG operations, which gives us significant visibility into the billions of dollars of annual cash flow for the long-term. Perhaps just as important as visibility is flexibility. Maintaining and enhancing our IG ratings and steadily growing the dividend to a reasonable payout over time, provide ideal financial flexibility, which enables us to maintain a robust buyback plan while simultaneously funding accretive brownfield growth within cash flow, which will improve both the numerator and denominator of our run rate DCF per share goals. As Jack mentioned, the capital allocation plan is designed to provide investors with the framework, which they can take confidence, thanks to our cash flow visibility and financial flexibility to enable sustainable long-term value creation. During the second quarter, we repurchased over 3.1 million shares for approximately $500 million, helping bring our total shares outstanding to approximately $226 million today. The buyback program continues to work as designed, deploying allocated capital into the stock, which can increase significantly in periods of sustained dislocation as we saw in the first half. While the amount of shares repurchased in the second quarter trails that of the first quarter, it's important to remember that the first quarter is nearly $1.2 billion of share repurchases, was enabled in part by the accumulation of some cash in the plan over the preceding several quarters, which was unlocked as the stock underperformed in Q1 and into Q2. With the upsized share repurchase authorization commencing at the start of the third quarter, we remain committed in our track to reach our goal of approximately 200 million shares outstanding later this decade and opportunistically complete the upsized $4 billion buyback program by 2027. Moving to the balance sheet. We issued our second investment grade bond at CQP in May. And in June, we used the $1.2 billion of proceeds from the 5.75% senior notes to redeem approximately $1.2 billion of a 5.625% senior secured [indiscernible] due 2027. Consistent with prior issuances, this transaction extends our maturity profile while further desecuring and desubordinating our consolidated balance sheet by moving secured project debt from SPL to unsecured corporate debt at CQP. During the quarter, we also fully retired the 2024 SPL notes, repairing the remaining approximately $150 million of outstanding principle with cash on hand. Over the next few quarters, we'll focus on our debt paydown on the remaining outstanding principle of the SPL 2025 notes, after which point, we will not have any debt maturing until the middle of 2026. The rating agencies continue to recognize our progress on the balance sheet. In May, in conjunction with the CQP issuance, Moody's upgraded both CQP and SPL to Baa2 and Baa1, respectively, representing a double upgrade at CQP. And in July, Fitch upgraded CCH to BBB+. These positive rating actions reflect our balance sheet management to date and our commitment to opportunistically delever and desubordinate going forward as we target long-term leverage of under 4x run rate EBITDA and BBB corporate credit ratings at both LNG and CQP. The Corpus upgrade specifically is also a recognition of the significant progress achieved at Stage 3 today. For the second quarter, we have maintained a dividend of $0.435 per common share. As announced in June, we plan to increase the dividend by 15% to $2 annualized next quarter. Beyond this year, we remain committed to our guidance of growing our dividend by approximately 10% annually, not just through 2026, but through the decade, at which point we'll be at a payout ratio of only about 20%, enabling us to maintain the financial flexibility essential to our comprehensive and balanced long-term capital allocation plan and growth objectives, with investment-grade metrics and internally generated cash flow funding at both Sabine and Corpus. During the quarter, we funded approximately $400 million of CapEx on Stage 3, bringing total unlevered spend on the project to approximately $3.8 billion. Front-loading the equity spend has enabled considerable interest savings, and we still have over $3 billion available on our CCH term loan as additional liquidity for CEI in the coming years through construction. We expect to spend between $1.5 billion to $2 billion in Stage 3 CapEx this year, before accounting for any draws on the CCH term loan. We maintained significant total liquidity in addition to our DCF forecast and therefore, flexibility with almost $3 billion of cash on hand, plus over $3 billion of available term loan at CCH as well as open revolvers across the Cheniere complex. Turning now to Slide 14 where I will discuss our upwardly revised 2024 guidance. Today, we are raising and tightening our full-year 2024 guidance ranges to $5.7 billion to $6.1 billion and consolidated adjusted EBITDA from $5.5 billion to $6 billion, and $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion in distributable cash flow from $2.9 billion to $3.4 billion. Several factors contributed to our improved forecast for the year primarily from additional production layered into the forecast post our turnarounds, as well as optimization activities achieved upstream and downstream of our facilities since the last call. As Jack noted, our maintenance programs not only minimize production impacts to both sites, but also unlock efficiencies at CCL that should offset the impacts to production from the winter storm we experienced in the first quarter into the second half of this year. Of course, we are still in hurricane season on the Gulf Coast, and while we had no impacts to our production from Hurricane Beryl last month. We keep a very close eye on potential hurricane impacts as our expected results could be impacted by future weather events at our sites. However, we decided to tighten the guidance considering we are now more than halfway through the year, we've completed our major maintenance at both sites, and a decent portion of the optimization has been locked in, on top of this being our most contracted year ever on a percentage basis. We still expect to produce approximately 45 million tones of LNG this year, inclusive of the planned maintenance downtime at both sites. And our guidance continues to reflect only contributions from completed or locked in portfolio optimization activities as we do not forecast potential contributions from future optimization opportunities. And of course, our results could be impacted by the timing of certain cargoes around year-end. Our DCF for 2024 could also be affected by changes in the tax code. As noted on prior calls, we qualified for the corporate alternative minimum taxes here. However, upcoming guidance related to the implementation of this tax, which is expected later this year, specifically regarding the taxing of unrealized derivatives, could impact the timing and amount of our cash tax payments this year and going forward. We would expect any impacts to primarily be a matter of timing and should not impact our ability to generate over $20 billion of available cash through 2026. We do not forecast any contribution to revenues or EBITDA from Stage 3 volumes this year. We look forward to updating you on our 2025 volume projections, inclusive of Stage 3 contributions on our Q3 call. We continue to target first LNG at the end of the year and the first 3 trains to reach substantial completion by the end of 2025, reinforcing our view that 2024 is expected to be a trough year and 2025 will begin the step-up of our run rate production above the 9 train 450 mtpa. As we look out beyond the next few years, our conviction in the long-term role of our LNG in global energy markets, and Cheniere's position in it, have only strengthened. At Cheniere, we lead with our safety track record operational and commercial reputation and financial discipline to generate and deploy accretively the billions of dollars to cash flow year after year. We are leveraging all of those advantages to continue to create sustainable and growing long-term value for our shareholders and supply our global customer base with our flexible, reliable and affordable LNG for decades to come. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions. Sure. Thanks, Theresa. This is Zach. I'd say going into the last call, we are already tracking to the upper half of the range. So we were in a good position. And now we're able to not only raise it, but tied in it by $200 million on the low end. So at this point, we're comfortably in the middle of the range, if not better. And the reason for that is that there was probably another incremental $100 million added to the EBITDA, thanks to production going up post the major maintenance at Corpus, helping Corpus catch up from some of the feed gas quality issues that it had in Q1. And then just more optimization across the board from upstream and downstream and sub chartering. So to go from there, there's still a little variability. We won't account for most of the optimization that could happen in the second half of the year, in particular on the upstream side on basis differentials. And then Henry Hub is a variable just on lifing margin. Every $0.50 move in Henry Hub probably affects our lifting margin and EBITDA by about $30 million still for the rest of the year. And then we're still in a hurricane season. So weather permitting, if things go smoothly as they have gone to date, maybe there will be some incremental production. And if not, we could also lose some production if we have incremental downtime above and beyond what we normally budget or give ourselves coverage for. And then there's a little variability at the end of the year just on year-end timing of deliveries. We don't bake into the forecast late deliveries in the year. So that might add out a bit, but shouldn't materially affect us on the downside. So things are pretty big this year as it was already our most contracted year ever. Hey, Jeremy. Sure. This is Zach. And obviously, everything we do needs to go through and be approved by the Board before we announce it. But let's put it this way, $4 billion isn't going to be it. And 200 million shares outstanding isn't our final target. So we're going to just continue to work it down. And we needed this right now follow through on the 2020 vision. And getting to that point, we're on a run rate sustainable basis even at $2 margins, not like the $7, $8 margins we're seeing on the screen for the next 1.5 years. We're comfortably in the 20s on DCF per share. But how we look at it? That $4 billion should get us pretty close to 200 million shares really just depends on share price. And then we look at our cash flow forecast and ensure that we can meet those commitments of finishing a $4 billion incremental buyback program by 2027 or sooner with on top of that, being balanced on our capital allocation and achieving all the other goals we want to achieve, which is not just finishing up Stage 3 in 2025 and 2026, but FID and the expansion there and getting Sabine ready, having the balance sheet get to BBB across the board by being proactive on that. And obviously, we increased the dividend by 15% and committed to a 10% growth rate for the rest of the decade. So a balance of all of that is how we got to $4 billion, but I wouldn't think too much about that because we've been known to increase it over time. And I'll just add with all the success that the team that the origination team has had in the last year or two, if we wanted to be \u2013 we could be 100% contracted even with the mid-scale expansion of 8 to 9 and debottlenecking. That's how many contracts we have. So we're in a really good spot where \u2013 now with the EA at Corpus for midscale 8 and 9 targeting FID next year once we have the permits and we can make that fully contracted. And with the contract at Galp and everything else that we've signed tied to Train 7 or Train 8, we have more than enough to even FID in a couple of years or so, a first phase of a Sabine expansion. So that's in mind too, as we continue to do value engineering there and work on it with Bechtel. I'll answer that. And we can't speak for what's going on at these other projects, obviously. And it doesn't really matter because if we're not going to hit our financial standard, why are we going to take undue risk and dilute the returns that we're already providing to all our shareholders. That we can easily get by just buying back more stock and letting investors own more Sabine and Corpus already in place. So that's their brownfield like best, I guess, and that's for them to figure out. Whereas for us, we think we can do even better. And that will allow us to achieve 7x CapEx to EBITDA, 10% unlevered returns. And that's just contracted nothing more than 225 on CMI and a fully wrapped EPC. Anything beyond that in terms of early completion, higher CMI levels, optimization, that's just upside to us all, but never baked in when we FID these projects. Working with Bechtel, clearly now thinking about limited notices to proceed even later this year and then to be in a position to have full notice to proceed next year. We have a decent sense of where pricing is shaking out, especially for 9, and it's all looking good. I guess we should have expected that question from you. But I'll just say \u2013 we've been at around 5 million tons per train on the first 9 trains for a while, and now we're still at 5 million tons per train. And we're doing major maintenance every year. So for the next few years, hard to see that moving materially up. But we are making investments. We've mentioned before, things like fin fans that should eventually help us get closer to the higher end of that range. But not yet. We're not in the business of overpromising on this. I would say no commitment yet for the future years. If we go back to the May call, we basically said that production was a little light compared to forecast because after the freeze, we had some feed gas quality issues at Corpus, but we more than made up with it, with the optimization, we were able to do upstream and downstream in the plan. We have more upstream and downstream optimization and subchartering added to the forecast this time around. But on top of that, we're catching back up to where we thought we would be and closer to target for the full year. So hard to say that this is going to be a benefit for the future, but maybe more \u2013 allow us to be more solid on the forecast going forward."

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Frances Smith, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nFrances Smith: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Cheniere's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. The slide presentation and access to the webcast for today's call are available at cheniere.com. This is Frances Smith on for Randy, who unfortunately couldn't be here this morning. Joining me are Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO; Anatol Feygin, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Zach Davis, Executive Vice President and CFO; and other members of Cheniere's senior management.\n Before we begin, I would like to remind all listeners that our remarks, including answers to your questions, may contain forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from what is described in these statements. Slide 2 of our presentation contains a discussion of those forward-looking statements and associated risks. In addition, we may include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. \n A reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measure can be found in the appendix to the slide presentation. As part of our discussion of Cheniere's results, today's call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP, or CQP. We do not intend to cover CQP's results separately from those of Cheniere Energy, Inc. \n The call agenda is shown on Slide 3. Jack will begin with operating and financial highlights. Anatol will then provide an update on the LNG market, and Zach will review our financial results and guidance. After prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. I will now turn the call over to Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO. \nJack Fusco: Thank you, Frances, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today as we review our first quarter results, highlighting a successful start to 2024 across the entire Cheniere platform. The first quarter was marked by strong financial results and outstanding execution across Cheniere, including all pillars of our capital allocation plan objectives. We made significant meaningful progress on the future development across both sites, all of which continues to be enabled by a relentless focus to be the leading producer of LNG to the world. \n Our focus and commitment to operational excellence has never been more important, as we face significant and potentially exponential growth in power demand around the globe, which is projected to be met in part with natural gas-fired generation. The global acceleration of power demand is driven by the penetration of electric vehicles, the electrification of heating, cooling, industrial production and most topically lately, power-hungry data centers. \n As Anatol and I have discussed on previous earnings calls, this opportunity is a global one and only helps to support our long-held conviction regarding the structural shift to natural gas around the world. We believe natural gas and LNG are critical to enabling this long-term electrification as one of the most reliable, flexible, cost competitive and dispatchable energy sources. And it underscores the critical need for further investment in LNG and natural gas infrastructure worldwide. \n Please turn to Slide 5, where I'll highlight our key accomplishments for the quarter. In the first quarter, we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.8 billion, distributable cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion and net income of approximately $500 million. Zach will address the main drivers of our performance shortly, but I want to address some operational highlights from the quarter. \n In January, while the freeze event in Texas did not physically impact our Corpus Christi facility as we have robust price protection protocols in place. We were affected as a result of the impact of feed gas on upstream infrastructure for natural gas production and processing located in the Permian. These impacts led to temporary composition changes and the quality of our feed gas, which did create some production challenges during the quarter. \n While we cannot control these external factors, I am proud of the performance of the Cheniere's production professionals to adapt quickly to address the challenges in order to meet all of our commercial commitments and maintain our track record of reliability that our customers are accustomed to. Despite the indirect freeze-related production challenges, we still met all of our customer obligations. The experience and knowledge gained from 8-plus years of operating the second largest liquefaction platform in the world has prepared us to strategically and safely respond to volatility and disruptions throughout the LNG value chain, which has been evidenced repeatedly over the last several quarters, and the first quarter was no exception. \n Overall, production across our platform was largely flat year-over-year, thanks to the stellar operations, lower maintenance and colder weather at Sabine Pass. As noted previously, based on lessons learned in our first major maintenance turnaround last year, we've been able to optimize the maintenance schedule this year and spread out some of the planned maintenance more strategically across the calendar. And year-to-date, we have already completed several smaller scale, more efficient turnaround programs with minimized impacts to our ongoing commercial operations. \n Those will continue throughout the year, especially as we continue into the summer months, but we do not anticipate a long outage like we executed in June last year. \n Looking ahead to the balance of 2024, today, we are reconfirming our full year guidance of $5.5 billion to $6 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $2.9 billion to $3.4 billion of distributable cash flow. Our production forecast is largely unchanged since the February call, and we have an immaterial amount of volume remaining unsold. We'll continue to update our annual outlook as we progress further into the year and get past some planned maintenance in upcoming hurricane season. \n During the first quarter, Zach and his team continue to make significant progress across our capital allocation priorities. In the first quarter, we repurchased over 7.5 million shares for approximately $1.2 billion. an all-time record quarterly amount for our company, which demonstrates our opportunistic approach to share buybacks. We continue to manage the balance sheet, opportunistically refinancing approximately $1.5 billion of debt maturing next year with an overall investment-grade bond at the Cheniere Energy level, and we repaid $150 million of long-term debt at SPL during the quarter. \n We also paid a quarterly dividend of $0.435 and invested over $500 million in Stage 3, which continues to progress extremely well. \n Speaking of Stage 3, turn to Slide 6, I'll update you on the status of our expansion projects, Corpus Christi Stage 3 and mid-scale trades 8, 9 in the SPL expansion project. Bechtel continues to progress construction on Stage 3 on an accelerated schedule. The project stood at over 55% completion at the end of March. All coal boxes for trains 1 through 3 have been set in place. Over 90% of the pipeline have been installed, all mechanical equipment for Train 1 has been delivered to the site. Concrete work for trains 2 and 3 is over 70% complete, and the compressors for Trains 2 and 3 have been set. \n I remain optimistic that together with Bechtel, we will achieve first LNG by the end of 2024 and bring all 7 trains online before the end of 2026. During the quarter, we continue to work closely with FERC to progress the permitting approval process for trains 8 and 9 at Corpus Christi. We expect to receive our environmental assessment soon and remain confident that we will receive all necessary regulatory approvals to be able to sanction the project in 2025. And for our major growth project at Sabine Pass, the SPL expansion project. \n We submitted the full applications to FERC and DOE in February. Anatol and team continue to work towards commercializing the project. Mosach and the team managed the balance sheet and CQP's funding plan in advance of sanctioning the project, which remains targeted for 2026. In February, I highlighted my confidence in the critical role of U.S. LNG in the global energy market and the need for significant investment in and permitting additional liquefaction capacity today to meet the expected growth in global demand over the coming decades. \n The United States has an unprecedented opportunity to play a vital role in helping provide real long-term energy solutions the world over. That will improve the everyday lives of millions or billions of people while meaningfully lowering global emissions. My conviction in this, is as strong as ever, and I believe the over $40 billion brownfield infrastructure platform, we have developed best positioned Cheniere to meaningfully participate in that future growth while continuing to supply the world with our cleaner burning LNG. \n Let's further address the vast benefits and critical role of LNG on the next slide. Recently, some reports have challenged the environmental benefits of LNG relative to coal. When compared to coal, natural gas is a more efficient energy source for power generation that results in demonstrable, lower greenhouse gas emissions and traditional [air fumes], which improves air quality and public health. In fact, peer-reviewed studies examining U.S. LNG delivered to China for power generation estimate that coal-to-gas switching results in approximately 50% lower greenhouse gas emissions on a full life cycle basis. \n These findings are based on an extensive body of research, including our own peer-reviewed life cycle assessment utilizing data specific to our supply chain including operational data. We strongly disagree with recent research, which claims the opposite while utilizing cherry-picked assumptions, and that has not gone through peer review.  We expect natural gas and LNG to serve as one of the most powerful drivers of global decarbonization like it has in the U.S., where the IEA estimates that coal to gas switching has resulted in a reduction of over 0.5 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions since 2005. \n We continue to focus on full life cycle environmental performance and are working on improving our Scope 1 methane and CO2 intensity while engaging with our supply chain partners to help deploy detection and quantification technologies, to improve the life cycle emissions of our LNG, further demonstrating the sustainability as a fuel source. Beyond the environmental advantages, the reliability, dispatchability and relative affordability of natural gas is unmatched and developing economies understandably prioritize energy security, reliability and affordability ahead of climate considerations. \n In fact, global coal consumption reached 8.5 gigatons in 2023, surpassing 2022's total and setting a new all-time global consumption record with the greatest increases coming from the rapidly emerging economies of China and India. Coal to gas switching in emerging markets like these represent the most powerful and executable long-term energy solution that enables energy security and reliability while significantly improving the emissions profile of these countries. \n Simply put natural gas and LNG are currently actionable in common sense solutions to powering emerging economies around the world while lowering global emissions to meet their climate policies. The global call for energy security in recent years, particularly in Europe underscores the long-term role of natural gas in both developed and developing economies which is further evidenced by the trillions of dollars being invested in natural gas infrastructure worldwide and the fact that there are 400 million tonnes per annum of LNG facilities today but over 1,200 million tonnes per annum of regasification capacity and operations are under construction. \n Our long-term tailored LNG solutions provide customers the ability to secure long-term reliable energy supply while maintaining flexibility with regard to the energy transition plans and pathways.  At home, the LNG industry is stimulating the economy and creating thousands of jobs, all while supporting domestic production and stabilizing domestic energy prices and cash flows with our long-term predictable demand for the decades of economic resource. We are fortunate to be sitting on here in the U.S. \n It was only a few years ago, the market began highlighting the energy trilemma based on its pillars of energy security, energy equity and environmental sustainability. The case for LNG growth for decades to come remains clear to us as does the investment thesis for Cheniere. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on safely and reliably operating our 2 facilities on the Gulf Coast, while generating meaningful value to stakeholders by delivering on our promises to our customers, investors, employees, regulators and communities, supporting the energy needs of hundreds of millions of people worldwide. \n With that, I'll hand it over to Anatol to discuss the LNG market. Thank you all again for your continued support of Cheniere. \nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9. The global LNG market remained fundamentally balanced throughout the first quarter as winter supply risks moderated, achieving market equilibrium at relatively lower prices compared to last year. Mild weather in Europe, sustained elevated gas inventories, maintaining pressure on global prices, which fell low enough to stimulate spot buying activity across Asia. \n For the first quarter, JKM and TTF averaged $11.90 in MMBtu and $9.41 in MMBtu, respectively, both down more than 50% year-over-year and 65% and 77% lower than full year '22 levels, respectively and we have also decreased in the first quarter, falling to an average of $2.42, down 35% year-on-year. At these lower price levels, incremental price sensitive demand emerged in Asia. \n In fact, a particularly strong demand response was observed not only in China but also in India, Thailand and other emerging Asian economies as they replenished LNG inventories and continued to benefit from improving economic outlooks. This resulted in a circa 4% year-on-year increase in total global LNG import growth in the first quarter, supported by a small but meaningful uptick in Lat Am markets, including Colombia, as a result of dry conditions and low hydro levels. \n The middle chart shows a visible uptick in tendering activity in Asia, with JKM prices remaining over 50% lower than a year ago, tenders for deliveries to the region in Q1 climbed to the highest level since the third quarter of '21. And it is not surprising that 2 large price elastic markets of India and China represented 47% and 22% of the total awarded cargoes during the quarter. \n Nevertheless, U.S. LNG continued to flow predominantly to Europe, which is in part due to trade route optimization as the Panama and Suez canals continue to be constrained. The logistical challenges with both canals have had a relatively limited impact on market fluidity so far, given only 10% of global LNG flows have historically transited these passage ways. Let's address the regional dynamics on the next page. \n In Europe, short-term demand fundamentals remain subdued and largely unchanged despite a partial return of some industrial demand in countries such as Germany and the Netherlands, as shown on the chart on the upper left.  Well-supplied market, coupled with lower power generation due in part to warm weather and lower economic activity have continued to suppress gas demand across all sectors. In fact, February and March saw record demand lows for the comparable period as total gas consumption in the key European markets dropped 2.6% year-on-year. \n Gas-fired generation fell 8.4% year-on-year following a recovery in hydropower, strong wind and lower power demand, all of which reduced the need for thermal generation in the quarter. In addition, industrial gas consumption in the first quarter remained about 20% below 2021 levels despite European gas prices falling to precrisis levels. Consequently, LNG imports to Europe fell 4.4 million tonnes or 13% year-on-year amid high storage levels, which stood at over 58% full entering injection season, the highest levels since 2011 when the data first became available. \n These dynamics in Europe resulted in TTF trading at a discount to JKM for most of the quarter which allowed cargoes to steadily flow to Asia as end users in the region took advantage of reduced price levels to increase purchases and replenish stocks early in the season. Most notably, in China, LNG imports for the first quarter grew 4 million tonnes year-on-year, a 25% increase as China reinforces its position as the largest LNG market globally. \n The increased pull on gas from across all sources in China during the quarter, including pipe imports and domestic production, coupled with expansion of gas infrastructure across 4 underground gas storage and regas further underscores China's commitment to natural gas as a long-term primary energy source. During the quarter, China added around 2.4 gigawatts of gas-fired power generation on top of the nearly 10 gigawatts added last year and the 49 gigawatts currently under construction, which we believe will continue to drive natural gas demand in the region. \n Similar buying patterns emerged in India and Thailand, where imports rose 45% and 27%, respectively, during the quarter, both on increased gas-fired power demand, reinforcing our thesis that latent demand from price-sensitive end-use markets to continue to emerge as commodity prices further stabilize. These increases were in stark contrast to the less price-sensitive markets of North Asia, especially in Japan and Korea, where slowdown in electricity demand, coupled with higher nuclear availability impacted gas demand in the region. \n LNG imports into these 2 markets dropped by 2.5 million tons year-on-year, partially offsetting the 8.4 million tonnes of annualized incremental imports seen in China, and Southeast Asia. On a net basis, Asia's imports rose by roughly 6 million tonnes year-on-year during the quarter, making the fourth consecutive quarter with positive growth. \n As we look ahead in the near term, we see several factors that could tighten the current market balance. Facilities across the U.S. Gulf Coast are currently experiencing heavier-than-usual maintenance and certain international facilities are severely constrained as exporters turn to the import market. Additionally, summer heat waves in India and China are expected to result in elevated seasonal demand and finally, any delays in expected new supply could, of course, exacerbate this tightness. \n Let's move to the next slide to look further ahead to the post-2025 period. The tight and volatile market conditions over the past few years and the ensuing LNG contracting momentum have led to a number of projects reaching FID. As a result, there's roughly 200 million tons per annum of LNG production capacity under construction globally, while even more is targeting FID in order to meet a supply/demand gap forecast to open later this decade. \n The level of new capacity set to come online over the 2026 to '28 period emphasizes the cyclicality of this industry and the uneven nature of LNG supply growth relative to demand. In fact, the coming supply cycle or wave is the third that the industry will have experienced over its history. This cycle has higher levels of absolute growth than the previous 2, as you can see on the 2 charts on the slide. \n As a result, many commentators are cautioning that the market may tip into oversupply later this decade as the current wave of projects under construction in the U.S. and Qatar, along with some pre-FID projects start service. We acknowledge that the global capacity under construction today, plus what may reach FID in the near term could generate a larger supply increase than seen in previous cycles. But we also believe that the underlying market should accommodate the growth efficiently without resorting to curtailments on the supply side. \n In fact, we note that the only year the market has previously had to resort to such balancing mechanisms was 2020 due to the unprecedented demand impacts related to the pandemic. It's important to note that while the amount of new supply may be larger than previous cycles in absolute terms, it is a smaller proportion of the underlying LNG trade than previous waves. We also now have a more flexible and diverse global LNG market than ever before, with over 1,200 million tons of import capacity available by the middle of the decade and another 100 million tons or so in development to ensure more efficient matching of supply and demand. \n In addition, after the recent high spot prices, we believe there is a good deal of latent demand set to be stimulated at the right price levels, which we have already started to see year-to-date. This is where we see the coming start-up of new LNG supply is constructive for the market. We believe new supply will help moderate spot prices and volatility to a relatively more affordable and less volatile level on a sustained basis, helping LNG reinforce its credentials as an affordable, secure and sustainable component of baseload energy supply, particularly for the high-growth nations of Asia, which are currently heavily dependent on coal to support their economic growth and energy security. \n So in short, we believe new LNG supply in the coming years will be absorbed by the market efficiently, and it will be helpful in supporting a price and volatility environment that will reinforce LNG and natural gas as a long-term reliable, flexible and cost competitive energy solution for decades to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Zach to review our financial results and guidance. \nZach Davis: Thanks, Anatol, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our first quarter 2024 results, key financial accomplishments and guidance. \n Turn to Slide 13. For the first quarter of 2024, we generated net income of approximately $502 million, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.8 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion. With today's results, we have now reported positive net income on a quarterly and cumulative trailing 4-quarter basis, 6 quarters in a row. \n Our first quarter 2024 results reflect lower international gas prices relative to last year as well as a higher proportion of our LNG being sold under long-term contracts. As Jack noted, our results also reflect some impacts to our operations at CCL following the winter freeze in Texas. Fortunately, our team had been able to forward sell several cargoes at elevated margins. which, coupled with the incremental volumes achieved at SPL partially offset these production impacts during the quarter. \n In addition, realized or locked in optimization margins in Q1 more than offset the financial impacts at Corpus to push our forecast slightly above the midpoint of our guidance ranges, already trending us in the right direction in the first half of the year. \n During the first quarter, we recognized an income 619 TBtu of physical LNG, which included 608 TBtu from our projects and 11 TBtu sourced from third parties. Approximately 90% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SPA or IPM agreements with initial terms greater than 10 years. This year, our team has continued to execute on our 2020 Vision capital allocation plan. Maintaining the year-to-date momentum we highlighted on our call in February. \n In the first quarter alone, we deployed approximately $2 billion towards shareholder returns, balance sheet management and disciplined growth and are now over $10 billion through deploying the $20-plus billion of available cash we forecast back in the fall of 2022. As we continue to progress towards the goal of $20 per share of run rate distributable cash flow. We remain committed to deploying our DCF efficiently and value accretively, having already deployed over 50% of the at least $20 billion goal through 2026 in under 40% of the time. \n During the quarter, we repurchased over 7.5 million shares for approximately $1.2 billion, marking the most active quarter for our buyback plan to date or over 3% of our shares outstanding in just 1 quarter, helping to bring our shares outstanding today to below $230 million. The buyback activity during the first quarter clearly demonstrates how the programmatic structure of our repurchase plan enables us to be very opportunistic in periods of dislocation. \n The activity last quarter accelerated the progress on our 3-year $4 billion share repurchase authorization and our progress towards the cumulative 1:1 share repurchase to debt paydown ratio we have targeted. We have now deployed over 75% of the $4 billion 3-year buyback program in just 50% of the time and narrowed the gap between debt paydown and share buybacks by over $1 billion just in the last quarter. \n There is now less than $1 billion remaining on the current authorization. So we will work with our Board on a new plan with the expectation we'll have that in place before the end of the year, while always accounting for our balanced approach to capital allocation with a focus on attractive brownfield growth at both sites. \n Moving to the balance sheet. As Jack mentioned, we issued the inaugural investment-grade bond at CEI in March and in April, we used the $1.5 billion of proceeds from these 5.65% senior notes, along with cash on hand, to retire the approximately $1.5 billion of 5.875% senior secured notes at CCH due 2025. This March versus April timing dynamic explains our elevated cash and debt balances at quarter end, with both balances since reduced by $1.5 billion, now that the CCH 25 notes were paid down with the proceeds. \n Following our playbook for strategic refinancing, this transaction serves to extend our maturity profile and reduce our interest burden while desecuring and desubordinating our balance sheet by moving debt from this BCH secured to CEI unsecured level. During the quarter, we also repaid approximately $150 million of long-term indebtedness, further addressing the 2024 SPL notes due later this month. \n In February, Moody's issued a positive outlook at both CQP and SPL, which we hope will lead to favorable rating actions as we continue to opportunistically delever and desubordinate throughout our structure this year and beyond. We also declared a dividend of $0.435 per common share for the first quarter last week and remain committed to our guidance of growing our dividend by approximately 10% annually into the mid-2020s through construction of Stage 3. And over time, we plan to steadily increase our overall payout ratio as our platform grows while still maintaining the financial flexibility essential to our comprehensive long-term capital allocation plan and growth objectives. \n At CQP, we declared a distribution of $0.81 per common unit for the first quarter, consisting of the base distribution of $0.775 and a variable amount of $0.035. Adjusting the variable component of the common unit distribution enables us to strategically preserve cash and balance sheet capacity in advance of the SPL expansion project. \n In the near term, any deleveraging at CQP or SPL can mainly be considered early investments in the SPL expansion project until we are in a position to formally sanction the project, raise financing and begin construction, which we continue to expect in 2026. During the quarter, we funded a little over $500 million of CapEx at our Stage 3 project, bringing total spend to approximately $3.5 billion in total for the project. While front-loading the equity spend has enabled considerable interest savings, we still have over $3 billion available on our CCH term loan that we plan on using as additional liquidity for CEI in the coming years through construction. \n We continue to expect to spend between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in Stage 3 CapEx this year before accounting for any draws on the CCH term loan. \n Turning now to Slide 14, where I will discuss our 2024 guidance and outlook for the year. Today, we are reconfirming our full year 2024 guidance ranges of $5.5 billion to $6 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $2.9 billion to $3.4 billion in distributable cash flow. As we've noted previously, 2024 represents our most contracted year-to-date. We still expect 2024 to represent a trough year for EBITDA as we expect our results to trend higher after this year as Stage 3 commences and eventually reach its run rate by the end of 2026. \n As a reminder, our operating and financial results and forecast reflect some degree of seasonality as typically higher winter production at our facilities, coupled with typically higher pricing international markets, can provide for a somewhat seasonal weighting of our results to the colder quarters versus the hotter ones. For the balance of the year, we don't expect meaningful changes to our earnings forecast for the remaining 3 quarters with an immaterial amount of unsold capacity remaining. We still expect to produce approximately 45 million tonnes of LNG this year, inclusive of planned maintenance at both sites, and our guidance continues to reflect only contributions from completed portfolio optimization activities as we do not forecast potential contributions from future opportunities. \n We do not forecast any contribution to revenues or EBITDA from Stage 3 in 2024.  As always, our results could be impacted by the timing of certain cargoes around year-end as well as incremental margin from further optimization, upstream and downstream of our facilities. Our DCF for 2024 could also be affected by changes in the tax code under the IRA. However, the guidance provided today is based on the current IRA tax law guidance and assumes we are subject to a minimum corporate tax of 15% this year. \n As the year progresses, we should be in a position to tighten our ranges consistent with what we've done in the past. Despite our limited opening exposure this year and the lower LNG price environment, our 2024 guidance ranges are above our 9 train run rate guidance, and we remain in very good shape to achieve our 2020 Vision capital allocation plan. \n As we look beyond 2024, our highly contracted infrastructure platform is designed to largely insulate our financial results from any potential short-term market dislocations or periods of volatility, particularly as the market absorbs LNG capacity additions later this decade. Most critically, our longer-term outlook for the global LNG market is unchanged and periods of moderated market prices and sentiment have enabled us to accelerate our capital allocation progress and put even more distance between us and the competition. \n With every dollar deployed by our team, we are positioning Cheniere for the long term with a resilient and profitable future. It is the inherent stability and long-term visibility of our contracted cash flows along with our scale that enable us to meaningfully return capital to our stakeholders while methodically pursuing further disciplined and accretive brownfield growth, and at the same time, reliably and responsibly delivering affordable, cleaner burning energy to our customers worldwide. \n That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. \nJeremy Tonet: Anatol, I think you had some interesting commentary there with regards to the demand response to prices. And I was just wondering if you might be able to elaborate a little bit more on that, how deep that could be or what that could mean in the coming years given some of the supply dynamics as you laid out there or maybe just examples of what you're seeing? \nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Sure, Jeremy. Thanks. Well, first of all, it's an infrastructure question both Jack and I touched on this, hundreds and hundreds of millions of tons of regas capacity pipe storage capacity are being added globally. That includes Europe. Germany just received its fifth FSRU. Greece is coming online now as well. Of course, is Asia, where you have China that will roughly double its regas capacity. \n So -- you're not going to see -- we don't see a market where you will see significant bottlenecks like you saw in Europe over the last couple of years, and that will enable these markets to absorb these marginal volumes. We estimate today that it's order of magnitude, 50 million to 100 million tonnes. You saw a dramatic pickup in tendering activity in China, in India in the first quarter. And we think that with this additional infrastructure and all of the investment, as we've mentioned, in gas that will help balance the market at moderate prices of high single, low double digits. \nJeremy Tonet: High single, low double. Okay. And also, I was just curious, I guess, Corpus continues, I guess, to make great progress there. And just wondering -- at this point, any thoughts you could share with what that could mean for 2025 in the business overall? And I guess how that could impact pace of buybacks going forward or amount of buyback. \nJack Fusco: All right. So Jeremy, I'll start. This is Jack. Yes, I'm very, very pleased with the progress that's being made at Corpus. If you look at the pictures, you can really see Train 1, 2 and 3 and their progress to date, we're well ahead of plan, and I am congratulatory to Bechtel, but we're not popping champagne yet, but we're very optimistic of our ability to start producing LNG this year on Train 1. But with that, I'll turn it to Zack. \nZach Davis: Thanks, Jeremy. I'll just say, of course, we're very focused on first LNG this year, but it's really about the first few trains and how those ramp up through this year and into next to get some more meaningful millions of tonnes of LNG and make a real financial impact to '25 and make '24 more of the trough year as we've stated. As it relates to the buyback, it would be just gravy considering that when we came up with the 2020 vision and the over $20 billion of available cash, we assume the guaranteed completion dates. \n And we're talking about completion dates now that are almost a year ahead of schedule. But as we think about the buyback, basically, we guided everyone to over $10 billion would be deployed through '26 for debt paydown and buybacks, we're going to easily surpass that. And it was always the plan to reupsize the buyback plan inside of this time period as that was the only way we're going to get closer and closer to the 200 million shares over time. So now that we're under $1 billion on the buyback plan with the 7.5 million shares we bought in the last quarter, I expect that we're currently working with the Board and you should see a meaningful upside to the buyback plan later this year. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. We eagerly await the 200. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. \nKeith Stanley: Just following up on the buyback question. and realize you have to go through a board process on the authorization. Just to order of magnitude, I mean, thinking about the cash position, even after that April debt repayment, I think you have $3 billion of cash. Big picture, how much excess cash do you see the company having at this point aside from just ongoing cash generation? \nZach Davis: There's definitely plenty of liquidity for everything to continue to be meaningful as we continue to fund Stage 3. As we grow the dividend later this year and pay down some debt as we ramp down that variable DPU at CQP in anticipation of Sabine's expansion. \n But in terms of liquidity, we have over $3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We're going to make over $3 billion of DCF based on the forecast for the year. And we still have over $3 billion of availability on the term loan at Corpus. So liquidity is not the problem. We will be methodically buying back stock over time and being as opportunistic as we can in times like this. because it's only like times like this that we're going to be able to get down to 200 million shares by the middle of the decade. \n So everything is in good shape and well placed where we'll focus on debt pay down inside the CQP and we'll focus on buybacks up at LNG. \nKeith Stanley: Great. And then second question just on the year. So you talked about Q1 EBITDA. Obviously, it was strong with some of the just better in the winter, you have more volumes, more of your sort of high-priced above-market hedges, I guess, I guess how do you think about kind of where the year is tracking overall? You also called out some of the gas quality issues with the weather. And then just optimization wise, have you seen anything you'd call out year-to-date as optimization benefits and market-based opportunities, is Permian Gas helping you? And anything like that, that you would call out? \nZach Davis: Just to keep in mind, especially compared to '22 and '23, when you think about Henry Hub shipping day rates, or just overall commodity prices on an absolute basis, they're all much lower. So it's much more difficult to see those arbitrages and make as much on the optimization side. But optimization is coming in quite well, but the numbers aren't in the hundreds of millions. We probably made 50 plus so far this year. And with some SPL outperformance so far this year, too, that's why we're already tracking above the midpoint of the EBITDA guidance despite we'll need some tick up in production at CCL for the rest of the year. \n So optimization is coming together and with a little more outperformance on production and the upstream and downstream optimization that we've seen, yes, we have a good chance of trying to get to the higher end of the range. \nJack Fusco: And Keith, this is Jack. I would say this year is all about execution. So we need to safely execute on our engineering and construction plans. We need to safely execute on our operational excellence plan, and we need to continue to commercialize the SPL expansion with Amazon and this team. So it's all about execution for us. \nOperator: And our next question will come from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. \nJohn Mackay: I think this is one for Anatol. You guys have been clear on the positive outlook for global gas demand growth for a while now. But I guess I'd just be curious to drill in a little bit more on maybe how your forecast has changed over the last couple of quarters? And if you want to take a shot at the global data center demand growth number, I'm sure we're all ears. \nAnatol Feygin: Sure. Thanks, John. Go back 5, even 7 years maybe, and our ultimate forecast really hasn't changed much. We've been in the 700-ish million tonnes in 2040 and kind of a relatively somewhat constrained up into the right forecast. What, of course, has changed dramatically, as we've commented on before, is the supply side of the equation and how those things have shifted with Arctic Russia primarily being taken out of that supply stack.\n We think that the demand side, as we touched on earlier with Jeremy, is really constrained by having that affordable, secure, reliable LNG stream that we hope to continue to supply. Your -- the second part of your question, as Jack mentioned and I mentioned briefly like the electrification aspect of the world is a key driver, right? That's why things like GE Renova are doing quite well, and we are very happy to be part of that equation. And in conversations, unquestionably, that is a component. \n As I'm sure you know that the data center thing is a global phenomenon, and it is something that the big guys have a presence in a dozen or dozens, in some cases of countries. And our conversations do include that as a leg to the stool, but it's only one of the legs of the stool, and we think that, that's a key driver of gas generation demand and hence LNG will have a role to play there. \nJohn Mackay: That makes sense. And maybe actually just keeping it with you. We talked about the more sensitive buyers stepping up a little bit here. I know you're still working on the SPL expansion, some commercialization there. Maybe just spend a minute talking about kind of converting that higher recent buying into potential SPAs in the future. \nAnatol Feygin: Yes. So the countries that are seeing this fairly dramatic price elastic demand are primarily Asia, right, South, Southeast Asia and China itself.  The infrastructure there is not a constraint. You're seeing Thailand set records for LNG imports. You're going to see, we think, India set records, monthly records for LNG imports. China probably next year, not this year and that is all driven by these conversations, and they have had historically a good experience with LNG and certainly with Cheniere's performance and our track record, as Jack and Zack mentioned. \n So we do think that, that is a very good hand to play and a nice tailwind to those commercial engagements. \nOperator: And moving on to our next question, Theresa Chen with Barclays. \nTheresa Chen: Maybe as a follow-up to the emergence and growing share of the price-sensitive [markers]. And again, looking specifically at the uptick in India, how do you view India's role as long term as a demand set for LNG, it's regas capability and the lock? \nAnatol Feygin: Yes. So this is Anatol again. It is a -- it is one of the countries that is committed to dramatically increasing gas as the primary energy source. It is about half of the way there. Modi's policies historically and his commitment during this presidential campaign to infrastructure and infrastructure solutions remains resolute. The regas capacity. They're actually commissioning yet another terminal as we speak. Regas capacity will be north of 70 million tons shortly. \n It is approaching 50 million tons currently, which is double its import run rate. So we don't think that this will be an infrastructure bottleneck question in those markets. It is, again, a price-elastic market. Fertilizer is much less price elastic. Power is much more price elastic, but these are the prices that stimulate buying are prices that are at or above our long-term contracted economics, even assuming the forward curve for NYMEX. So we're -- we're very comfortable that, again, we fit into that equation. LNG does -- U.S. LNG does and, of course, Cheniere's product does. So those are all markets that are very interesting to us, and we have very healthy engagement with. \nTheresa Chen: Got it. And then maybe just another question on this global growth in data center team and understanding that might be a bit early to put like a number to the market opportunity out there, but I'm curious to your view as -- where do you see this likely taking place in the [indiscernible] global LNG flows and other legs of the stool from an infrastructure perspective, if necessary? \nAnatol Feygin: Yes. I guess I'll keep going. You're not talking to us to hear about how many GPUs NVIDIA will put into the market. But we look at things, We see roughly a doubling of demand globally by 2030 from about 2% to about 4% of power for data centers, obviously, driven in part by these more power-hungry chips. And we think that the easiest places and all the guys who are developing them, by the way, have huge teams that are looking for pockets of opportunity where there is the ability to add this capacity.\n One of the more interesting dynamics, if you will, is that Japan has been forecasting a dramatic decline in its power use by about 12% from '22 to 2030. The easiest places in the world to add this capacity is where this capacity exists. So again, these players have dozens of countries where they already have a presence. Countries that have very attractive rule of law, IP protection, et cetera, will be some of the primary beneficiaries of this driver. \n And -- the next plan from Japan is expected this fall. I would not be surprised if that power demand forecast is not revised higher with this as well as electrification in general, being one of the drivers. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Spiro Dounis with Citi. \nSpiro Dounis: Maybe just to go back to the Sabine pass expansion, maybe for you, Anatol. I'm curious if you can just give us an update on how commercial discussions are going there. You all had a pretty active 2023 signing that 6.5 million tons per annum. So just curious how you think about 2024 shaping up in that context. \nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Thanks, Spiro. It's a period, as we talked about even last quarter, it's a period of market kind of digesting all of these dynamics and issues, obviously, absolute record year for the U.S. product, with large in '22, very healthy year in '23. But clearly, there have been a number of developments that are causing the buyers to reassess and take their time, right? \n No one has the fog of war and the proverbial gun to their head, like they did in '22. So I would say the discussions are healthy. They're advancing, but this is more of a normal year for that side of the equation, then of course, '22, '23 work. But we're very very optimistic, and we think that what will play out for this year and next is going to very much rhyme with prior years in terms of the types of counterparties and the types of engagements. I don't think you'll be surprised by anything that you see from us going forward, but it's not going to be -- it's unlikely to be a repeat of '22. \n The one advantage we have, of course, is again, our performance, our track record, the fact that Corpus Stage 3 is progressing as well as it is and that we maintain our perfect track record of deliveries, and those are all great calling cards as other projects don't have the same kind of ability to engage based on those factors. \nSpiro Dounis: Got it. And second question, maybe just turning to maintenance and turnarounds. Jack, as you mentioned, you're sort of optimizing it throughout the year and spreading it out. Just curious if there's any way if you could just quantify how much maintenance is left at this point? And then maybe where some of the heavier periods might be throughout the year. \nJack Fusco: Yes, Spiro. So first, I mean, I'm always pleased that the team has figured out ways to make our maintenance, not noticeable to you all and that we're able to spread it out and do more maintenance on times when prices or the performance because of the heat during the summer is going to be less and less impactful and less material for us. So while I'm not going to give guidance on exactly how much maintenance is left, I'll see if Zach wants to add any commentary on what it means financially. \nZach Davis: I think this is pretty similar to what happened last year, where consensus was a little lower than our first quarter results. As folks often divide by for the EBITDA over the course of the year. The major maintenance, the planned maintenance is basically going to be, for the most part, in Q2 and Q3, which is also the time where production is lower as it's the warmer months. So you should expect a step down in EBITDA to an extent. And that's why we're still tracking well in the range and slightly above the midpoint, but that's why we didn't move the guidance range even though we had a strong first quarter. \n So expect that and then maybe in Q4, it comes back up a bit as the weather gets colder and there's not as much planned maintenance. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Ben Nolan with Stifel. \nBenjamin Nolan: I appreciate it. One of the things that we've been hearing a little bit lately about is increasing EPC costs and also, I guess, this week, labor shortages and just challenges on getting things built. It doesn't sound like that's a problem at all for you guys at the moment in Corpus Christi. But -- how do you think about things longer term with respect to the signing of long-term agreements and those sort of things.\n You don't really know what the cost is going to be at SPL. Just curious if maybe you could validate some of what we're hearing and how you're sort of positioned strategically for that. \nJack Fusco: Ben, this is Jack. As you know, we have a long-term relationship with Bechtel. We work very closely with them on trying to manage those inflationary costs. The workforce is getting tighter out there. We're over 3,000 workers at Corpus right now, should be close to 4,000 by the middle part of this year. They haven't had an issue with finding workers or worker availability, which is why they're extremely ahead of schedule. \n So I'm very pleased with their performance. We know we pay for it, but they deliver and it's a match made in heaven quite honestly, when they're able to deliver those trains early, and we're able to capitalize on the benefits of having that production early. So I believe we'll be able to manage the SPL expansion costs in a way that meets all of our environmental or all of our financial criteria and make sure that we continue to add meaningful value for our shareholders. \nZach Davis: And I'll just add, it comes back to the discipline because if we're not going to be able to build around that 6x to 7x CapEx to EBITDA, it's a lot easier to continue to just keep on buying back the stock and considering a multiple on a company like Cheniere without even accounting for like the brownfield growth prospects we have, the fact that we give run rate at 200 to 250 and we don't even show the capturing of all the optimization that every single quarter, even the past one we've done, it's unaccessibly too low when you're talking about something under 10x.\n So we will be patient on this. But clearly, we're doing the work already with Bechtel to have a decent sense, and that's why we've signed a few contracts already for the Sabine expansion. And if yes, if say there were a delay of FID by a year, give or take. That's just another $3 billion to $4 billion coming up through the system, meaning that the re-upsized buyback plan that we'll announce later this year will just be finished quicker. \nBenjamin Nolan: Got it. I appreciate it. And then if I could for my follow-up to Anatol. It seems like really, I don't know, since the first of the year, maybe even with the start of the pause long term, SPLs for U.S. projects have been pretty slow. There's maybe only one or two that I've seen. Is it pause related? Is it price related? Is it just sort of LNG prices are a little bit lower and that causes a lack of urgency on the part of buyers? Or is it none of those things. It's just sort of process of time, do you think? \nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Thanks, Ben. It's hard to pinpointed this precisely, but 150 million tons that the industry executed in '22, '23, again, was an unprecedented amount of contracting. And so can I say that the pause is having no effect on discussions? No. But as you know, it does not materially affect our timing for midscale 8 and 9 or for the SPL 5 expansion. \n Our counterparties know that, understand that. But as you said, there's a more methodical approach today than there was 12 or 24 months ago. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. \nJason Gabelman: The first one is maybe somewhat mechanical. You mentioned $950 million left on the buyback authorization. You obviously did $1.2 billion in 1Q. So if you want to keep up that pace, you're going to have to do an authorization this quarter. I guess, when is the earliest potential opportunity to reupsize the buyback authorization? \nZach Davis: Well, it's not going to be this quarter, and we'll continue to work with the Board over the next few months and even quarter or so and see where we are. And honestly, it depends on how -- how fast we deploy that $950 million. The more that the price stays around this level, yes, it will be sooner rather than later. But the commitment is by later this year, we'll have an upsized plan. and keep on trucking along to get that share count down to closer to $200 million. \nJason Gabelman: Okay. Got it. And then the second one is just going back to supply-demand balance outlook and you've commented on the demand quite extensively, but it seems like -- some of your larger peers are discussing delays to industry capacity coming online. And I'm wondering if you're noticing that to any extent where capacity that was expected to come online in 2025 is now shifting out to the right -- are you seeing anything to that extent? Can you quantify maybe any amount of volumes that you expect to come online in 2025 for the industry being pushed out? \nJack Fusco: First, Jason, I'm very, very pleased with the performance of my E&C team. And as you know, at Cheniere, we try to make it look easy, and it's really not, and that's what you're hearing from all of our colleagues, peers, competitors out there that are talking about delays or maybe having trouble going from commissioning to operations. So I'm very pleased with the way we've been able to build our facilities on time and on budget and the way our handoff is from E&C to operations.\n But as far as actual quantities, I don't know, Anatol, do you have a [gas] comment. \nAnatol Feygin: Yes. Jason, I'll just say, historically, roughly 2/3 of projects in LNG are delayed. Cheniere, as Jack already mentioned, has been the anomaly with us running on average 9 months ahead of schedule for trains. And you're certainly seeing that, right? You're seeing that projects that FIDs in '19 are going to now come online most likely middle of next year, maybe into the second half. \n You're seeing that phenomenon globally by some measurements you can say, QE FID, the North Field expansion in '17, and that is going to come online in the coming  year, 1.5 years or so. If you want to take a look at Wood Mac, it has reset its forecast and when these things are projected, everyone has roughly the same number and the number stacks up very consistently. And as prosecution of these projects gets into kind of the craft labor mode, you see those numbers come down quite dramatically, both in terms of volume per year as well as years added to execution. \n So I think tens of millions of tons will be smoothed out. We'll have a lot more information over the next year or so of the projects in the Gulf Coast really enter the craft labor phase. But the market is certainly starting to see that now. And Wood Mac has already started to revise its forecast. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. \nCraig Shere: Anatol, there's a lot of discussion on the call and other company calls about the growth in global power demand and AI and data centers. As we kind of look back a couple of years ago, probably Europe and maybe some other locations, we're thinking about LNG long term as being the transition fuel and intermittent -- backup for intermittent renewables. But are you seeing a change in mindset as people start thinking about a systemic need for more baseload power versus just backup power or transition fuels? \nAnatol Feygin: Thanks, Craig. It's a little bit of an unfair question because the people that we engage with have always thought that, right? Like we don't talk to the 1,000 counterparties in the world. We talk to the 3 or 4 dozen that think of things that way. And I will just say that backup to intermittency is still very much part of the equation, and that is a role that obviously our product plays very well. And that is something that, especially the portfolio players think about as they enter these engagements. \n But -- but clearly, our sort of load-serving counterparties think of our product as a baseload product. And that is something that clearly has very good traction. But to be fair, more so in Asia than in Europe. \nJack Fusco: And Craig, I'll tell you in my discussions with utilities around the world, there's much more discussion around dispatchability and the flexibility that natural gas combined cycle power plants give the grid versus an intermittent resource like wind or solar as well as both as regulation. So what doesn't get talked about are [bars] or Amperage and you can't get either of them from wind or solar. They have to come from thermal or nuclear. \nCraig Shere: Good point. And the last question for me on the discussion or debate about life cycle emissions from various fuels. Do you see this kind of obfuscation or debate at all increasing the demand or need to ultimately deploy carbon capture solutions. \nJack Fusco: We -- as you know, we're the only private company that actually did our own life cycle analysis and then had it peer reviewed. We had it published in the American Society of Chemical Engineers. It was commented on, it was blessed by academia and the scientists. We continue to revise it. We're using more measured data versus calculated data. We -- the inputs to our LCA is somewhere around 1,200 inputs that we plug in to come up with our cargo emission tags that we deliver on every cargo of our LNG. \n So we're getting better and better at it. We work closely with the National Petroleum Council that's part of the DOE, and we have developed a LCA that is, I'd say, a bridge. So it's a directional LCA for those people that maybe don't have the resources to calculate what their life cycle emissions is or are. And that's available now. It's an open architecture. It was released in April in Washington, so we're very pleased to be a major part of that analysis. \n And yes, I do think with this pause with the National Labs study, it will all come back at what the appropriate inputs are for the LCA. You should rest assured that Cheniere will be ready to comment on that and we're going to comment on it with real transparent data, not with guestimates. \nOperator: And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'll now hand the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. \nJack Fusco: Well, this is Jack. I just want to thank you all for your support and your attention this morning. Be safe. \nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have an excellent day.",

            "name": "Anatol Feygin",
            "content": "Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9. The global LNG market remained fundamentally balanced throughout the first quarter as winter supply risks moderated, achieving market equilibrium at relatively lower prices compared to last year. Mild weather in Europe, sustained elevated gas inventories, maintaining pressure on global prices, which fell low enough to stimulate spot buying activity across Asia. \n For the first quarter, JKM and TTF averaged $11.90 in MMBtu and $9.41 in MMBtu, respectively, both down more than 50% year-over-year and 65% and 77% lower than full year '22 levels, respectively and we have also decreased in the first quarter, falling to an average of $2.42, down 35% year-on-year. At these lower price levels, incremental price sensitive demand emerged in Asia. \n In fact, a particularly strong demand response was observed not only in China but also in India, Thailand and other emerging Asian economies as they replenished LNG inventories and continued to benefit from improving economic outlooks. This resulted in a circa 4% year-on-year increase in total global LNG import growth in the first quarter, supported by a small but meaningful uptick in Lat Am markets, including Colombia, as a result of dry conditions and low hydro levels. \n The middle chart shows a visible uptick in tendering activity in Asia, with JKM prices remaining over 50% lower than a year ago, tenders for deliveries to the region in Q1 climbed to the highest level since the third quarter of '21. And it is not surprising that 2 large price elastic markets of India and China represented 47% and 22% of the total awarded cargoes during the quarter. \n Nevertheless, U.S. LNG continued to flow predominantly to Europe, which is in part due to trade route optimization as the Panama and Suez canals continue to be constrained. The logistical challenges with both canals have had a relatively limited impact on market fluidity so far, given only 10% of global LNG flows have historically transited these passage ways. Let's address the regional dynamics on the next page. \n In Europe, short-term demand fundamentals remain subdued and largely unchanged despite a partial return of some industrial demand in countries such as Germany and the Netherlands, as shown on the chart on the upper left.  Well-supplied market, coupled with lower power generation due in part to warm weather and lower economic activity have continued to suppress gas demand across all sectors. In fact, February and March saw record demand lows for the comparable period as total gas consumption in the key European markets dropped 2.6% year-on-year. \n Gas-fired generation fell 8.4% year-on-year following a recovery in hydropower, strong wind and lower power demand, all of which reduced the need for thermal generation in the quarter. In addition, industrial gas consumption in the first quarter remained about 20% below 2021 levels despite European gas prices falling to precrisis levels. Consequently, LNG imports to Europe fell 4.4 million tonnes or 13% year-on-year amid high storage levels, which stood at over 58% full entering injection season, the highest levels since 2011 when the data first became available. \n These dynamics in Europe resulted in TTF trading at a discount to JKM for most of the quarter which allowed cargoes to steadily flow to Asia as end users in the region took advantage of reduced price levels to increase purchases and replenish stocks early in the season. Most notably, in China, LNG imports for the first quarter grew 4 million tonnes year-on-year, a 25% increase as China reinforces its position as the largest LNG market globally. \n The increased pull on gas from across all sources in China during the quarter, including pipe imports and domestic production, coupled with expansion of gas infrastructure across 4 underground gas storage and regas further underscores China's commitment to natural gas as a long-term primary energy source. During the quarter, China added around 2.4 gigawatts of gas-fired power generation on top of the nearly 10 gigawatts added last year and the 49 gigawatts currently under construction, which we believe will continue to drive natural gas demand in the region. \n Similar buying patterns emerged in India and Thailand, where imports rose 45% and 27%, respectively, during the quarter, both on increased gas-fired power demand, reinforcing our thesis that latent demand from price-sensitive end-use markets to continue to emerge as commodity prices further stabilize. These increases were in stark contrast to the less price-sensitive markets of North Asia, especially in Japan and Korea, where slowdown in electricity demand, coupled with higher nuclear availability impacted gas demand in the region. \n LNG imports into these 2 markets dropped by 2.5 million tons year-on-year, partially offsetting the 8.4 million tonnes of annualized incremental imports seen in China, and Southeast Asia. On a net basis, Asia's imports rose by roughly 6 million tonnes year-on-year during the quarter, making the fourth consecutive quarter with positive growth. \n As we look ahead in the near term, we see several factors that could tighten the current market balance. Facilities across the U.S. Gulf Coast are currently experiencing heavier-than-usual maintenance and certain international facilities are severely constrained as exporters turn to the import market. Additionally, summer heat waves in India and China are expected to result in elevated seasonal demand and finally, any delays in expected new supply could, of course, exacerbate this tightness. \n Let's move to the next slide to look further ahead to the post-2025 period. The tight and volatile market conditions over the past few years and the ensuing LNG contracting momentum have led to a number of projects reaching FID. As a result, there's roughly 200 million tons per annum of LNG production capacity under construction globally, while even more is targeting FID in order to meet a supply/demand gap forecast to open later this decade. \n The level of new capacity set to come online over the 2026 to '28 period emphasizes the cyclicality of this industry and the uneven nature of LNG supply growth relative to demand. In fact, the coming supply cycle or wave is the third that the industry will have experienced over its history. This cycle has higher levels of absolute growth than the previous 2, as you can see on the 2 charts on the slide. \n As a result, many commentators are cautioning that the market may tip into oversupply later this decade as the current wave of projects under construction in the U.S. and Qatar, along with some pre-FID projects start service. We acknowledge that the global capacity under construction today, plus what may reach FID in the near term could generate a larger supply increase than seen in previous cycles. But we also believe that the underlying market should accommodate the growth efficiently without resorting to curtailments on the supply side. \n In fact, we note that the only year the market has previously had to resort to such balancing mechanisms was 2020 due to the unprecedented demand impacts related to the pandemic. It's important to note that while the amount of new supply may be larger than previous cycles in absolute terms, it is a smaller proportion of the underlying LNG trade than previous waves. We also now have a more flexible and diverse global LNG market than ever before, with over 1,200 million tons of import capacity available by the middle of the decade and another 100 million tons or so in development to ensure more efficient matching of supply and demand. \n In addition, after the recent high spot prices, we believe there is a good deal of latent demand set to be stimulated at the right price levels, which we have already started to see year-to-date. This is where we see the coming start-up of new LNG supply is constructive for the market. We believe new supply will help moderate spot prices and volatility to a relatively more affordable and less volatile level on a sustained basis, helping LNG reinforce its credentials as an affordable, secure and sustainable component of baseload energy supply, particularly for the high-growth nations of Asia, which are currently heavily dependent on coal to support their economic growth and energy security. \n So in short, we believe new LNG supply in the coming years will be absorbed by the market efficiently, and it will be helpful in supporting a price and volatility environment that will reinforce LNG and natural gas as a long-term reliable, flexible and cost competitive energy solution for decades to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Zach to review our financial results and guidance. Yes. Sure, Jeremy. Thanks. Well, first of all, it's an infrastructure question both Jack and I touched on this, hundreds and hundreds of millions of tons of regas capacity pipe storage capacity are being added globally. That includes Europe. Germany just received its fifth FSRU. Greece is coming online now as well. Of course, is Asia, where you have China that will roughly double its regas capacity. \n So -- you're not going to see -- we don't see a market where you will see significant bottlenecks like you saw in Europe over the last couple of years, and that will enable these markets to absorb these marginal volumes. We estimate today that it's order of magnitude, 50 million to 100 million tonnes. You saw a dramatic pickup in tendering activity in China, in India in the first quarter. And we think that with this additional infrastructure and all of the investment, as we've mentioned, in gas that will help balance the market at moderate prices of high single, low double digits. Sure. Thanks, John. Go back 5, even 7 years maybe, and our ultimate forecast really hasn't changed much. We've been in the 700-ish million tonnes in 2040 and kind of a relatively somewhat constrained up into the right forecast. What, of course, has changed dramatically, as we've commented on before, is the supply side of the equation and how those things have shifted with Arctic Russia primarily being taken out of that supply stack.\n We think that the demand side, as we touched on earlier with Jeremy, is really constrained by having that affordable, secure, reliable LNG stream that we hope to continue to supply. Your -- the second part of your question, as Jack mentioned and I mentioned briefly like the electrification aspect of the world is a key driver, right? That's why things like GE Renova are doing quite well, and we are very happy to be part of that equation. And in conversations, unquestionably, that is a component. \n As I'm sure you know that the data center thing is a global phenomenon, and it is something that the big guys have a presence in a dozen or dozens, in some cases of countries. And our conversations do include that as a leg to the stool, but it's only one of the legs of the stool, and we think that, that's a key driver of gas generation demand and hence LNG will have a role to play there. Yes. So the countries that are seeing this fairly dramatic price elastic demand are primarily Asia, right, South, Southeast Asia and China itself.  The infrastructure there is not a constraint. You're seeing Thailand set records for LNG imports. You're going to see, we think, India set records, monthly records for LNG imports. China probably next year, not this year and that is all driven by these conversations, and they have had historically a good experience with LNG and certainly with Cheniere's performance and our track record, as Jack and Zack mentioned. \n So we do think that, that is a very good hand to play and a nice tailwind to those commercial engagements. Yes. So this is Anatol again. It is a -- it is one of the countries that is committed to dramatically increasing gas as the primary energy source. It is about half of the way there. Modi's policies historically and his commitment during this presidential campaign to infrastructure and infrastructure solutions remains resolute. The regas capacity. They're actually commissioning yet another terminal as we speak. Regas capacity will be north of 70 million tons shortly. \n It is approaching 50 million tons currently, which is double its import run rate. So we don't think that this will be an infrastructure bottleneck question in those markets. It is, again, a price-elastic market. Fertilizer is much less price elastic. Power is much more price elastic, but these are the prices that stimulate buying are prices that are at or above our long-term contracted economics, even assuming the forward curve for NYMEX. So we're -- we're very comfortable that, again, we fit into that equation. LNG does -- U.S. LNG does and, of course, Cheniere's product does. So those are all markets that are very interesting to us, and we have very healthy engagement with. Yes. I guess I'll keep going. You're not talking to us to hear about how many GPUs NVIDIA will put into the market. But we look at things, We see roughly a doubling of demand globally by 2030 from about 2% to about 4% of power for data centers, obviously, driven in part by these more power-hungry chips. And we think that the easiest places and all the guys who are developing them, by the way, have huge teams that are looking for pockets of opportunity where there is the ability to add this capacity.\n One of the more interesting dynamics, if you will, is that Japan has been forecasting a dramatic decline in its power use by about 12% from '22 to 2030. The easiest places in the world to add this capacity is where this capacity exists. So again, these players have dozens of countries where they already have a presence. Countries that have very attractive rule of law, IP protection, et cetera, will be some of the primary beneficiaries of this driver. \n And -- the next plan from Japan is expected this fall. I would not be surprised if that power demand forecast is not revised higher with this as well as electrification in general, being one of the drivers. Yes. Thanks, Spiro. It's a period, as we talked about even last quarter, it's a period of market kind of digesting all of these dynamics and issues, obviously, absolute record year for the U.S. product, with large in '22, very healthy year in '23. But clearly, there have been a number of developments that are causing the buyers to reassess and take their time, right? \n No one has the fog of war and the proverbial gun to their head, like they did in '22. So I would say the discussions are healthy. They're advancing, but this is more of a normal year for that side of the equation, then of course, '22, '23 work. But we're very very optimistic, and we think that what will play out for this year and next is going to very much rhyme with prior years in terms of the types of counterparties and the types of engagements. I don't think you'll be surprised by anything that you see from us going forward, but it's not going to be -- it's unlikely to be a repeat of '22. \n The one advantage we have, of course, is again, our performance, our track record, the fact that Corpus Stage 3 is progressing as well as it is and that we maintain our perfect track record of deliveries, and those are all great calling cards as other projects don't have the same kind of ability to engage based on those factors. Yes. Thanks, Ben. It's hard to pinpointed this precisely, but 150 million tons that the industry executed in '22, '23, again, was an unprecedented amount of contracting. And so can I say that the pause is having no effect on discussions? No. But as you know, it does not materially affect our timing for midscale 8 and 9 or for the SPL 5 expansion. \n Our counterparties know that, understand that. But as you said, there's a more methodical approach today than there was 12 or 24 months ago. Yes. Jason, I'll just say, historically, roughly 2/3 of projects in LNG are delayed. Cheniere, as Jack already mentioned, has been the anomaly with us running on average 9 months ahead of schedule for trains. And you're certainly seeing that, right? You're seeing that projects that FIDs in '19 are going to now come online most likely middle of next year, maybe into the second half. \n You're seeing that phenomenon globally by some measurements you can say, QE FID, the North Field expansion in '17, and that is going to come online in the coming  year, 1.5 years or so. If you want to take a look at Wood Mac, it has reset its forecast and when these things are projected, everyone has roughly the same number and the number stacks up very consistently. And as prosecution of these projects gets into kind of the craft labor mode, you see those numbers come down quite dramatically, both in terms of volume per year as well as years added to execution. \n So I think tens of millions of tons will be smoothed out. We'll have a lot more information over the next year or so of the projects in the Gulf Coast really enter the craft labor phase. But the market is certainly starting to see that now. And Wood Mac has already started to revise its forecast. Thanks, Craig. It's a little bit of an unfair question because the people that we engage with have always thought that, right? Like we don't talk to the 1,000 counterparties in the world. We talk to the 3 or 4 dozen that think of things that way. And I will just say that backup to intermittency is still very much part of the equation, and that is a role that obviously our product plays very well. And that is something that, especially the portfolio players think about as they enter these engagements. \n But -- but clearly, our sort of load-serving counterparties think of our product as a baseload product. And that is something that clearly has very good traction. But to be fair, more so in Asia than in Europe."

            "name": "Jack Fusco",
            "content": "Thank you, Frances, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today as we review our first quarter results, highlighting a successful start to 2024 across the entire Cheniere platform. The first quarter was marked by strong financial results and outstanding execution across Cheniere, including all pillars of our capital allocation plan objectives. We made significant meaningful progress on the future development across both sites, all of which continues to be enabled by a relentless focus to be the leading producer of LNG to the world. \n Our focus and commitment to operational excellence has never been more important, as we face significant and potentially exponential growth in power demand around the globe, which is projected to be met in part with natural gas-fired generation. The global acceleration of power demand is driven by the penetration of electric vehicles, the electrification of heating, cooling, industrial production and most topically lately, power-hungry data centers. \n As Anatol and I have discussed on previous earnings calls, this opportunity is a global one and only helps to support our long-held conviction regarding the structural shift to natural gas around the world. We believe natural gas and LNG are critical to enabling this long-term electrification as one of the most reliable, flexible, cost competitive and dispatchable energy sources. And it underscores the critical need for further investment in LNG and natural gas infrastructure worldwide. \n Please turn to Slide 5, where I'll highlight our key accomplishments for the quarter. In the first quarter, we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.8 billion, distributable cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion and net income of approximately $500 million. Zach will address the main drivers of our performance shortly, but I want to address some operational highlights from the quarter. \n In January, while the freeze event in Texas did not physically impact our Corpus Christi facility as we have robust price protection protocols in place. We were affected as a result of the impact of feed gas on upstream infrastructure for natural gas production and processing located in the Permian. These impacts led to temporary composition changes and the quality of our feed gas, which did create some production challenges during the quarter. \n While we cannot control these external factors, I am proud of the performance of the Cheniere's production professionals to adapt quickly to address the challenges in order to meet all of our commercial commitments and maintain our track record of reliability that our customers are accustomed to. Despite the indirect freeze-related production challenges, we still met all of our customer obligations. The experience and knowledge gained from 8-plus years of operating the second largest liquefaction platform in the world has prepared us to strategically and safely respond to volatility and disruptions throughout the LNG value chain, which has been evidenced repeatedly over the last several quarters, and the first quarter was no exception. \n Overall, production across our platform was largely flat year-over-year, thanks to the stellar operations, lower maintenance and colder weather at Sabine Pass. As noted previously, based on lessons learned in our first major maintenance turnaround last year, we've been able to optimize the maintenance schedule this year and spread out some of the planned maintenance more strategically across the calendar. And year-to-date, we have already completed several smaller scale, more efficient turnaround programs with minimized impacts to our ongoing commercial operations. \n Those will continue throughout the year, especially as we continue into the summer months, but we do not anticipate a long outage like we executed in June last year. \n Looking ahead to the balance of 2024, today, we are reconfirming our full year guidance of $5.5 billion to $6 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $2.9 billion to $3.4 billion of distributable cash flow. Our production forecast is largely unchanged since the February call, and we have an immaterial amount of volume remaining unsold. We'll continue to update our annual outlook as we progress further into the year and get past some planned maintenance in upcoming hurricane season. \n During the first quarter, Zach and his team continue to make significant progress across our capital allocation priorities. In the first quarter, we repurchased over 7.5 million shares for approximately $1.2 billion. an all-time record quarterly amount for our company, which demonstrates our opportunistic approach to share buybacks. We continue to manage the balance sheet, opportunistically refinancing approximately $1.5 billion of debt maturing next year with an overall investment-grade bond at the Cheniere Energy level, and we repaid $150 million of long-term debt at SPL during the quarter. \n We also paid a quarterly dividend of $0.435 and invested over $500 million in Stage 3, which continues to progress extremely well. \n Speaking of Stage 3, turn to Slide 6, I'll update you on the status of our expansion projects, Corpus Christi Stage 3 and mid-scale trades 8, 9 in the SPL expansion project. Bechtel continues to progress construction on Stage 3 on an accelerated schedule. The project stood at over 55% completion at the end of March. All coal boxes for trains 1 through 3 have been set in place. Over 90% of the pipeline have been installed, all mechanical equipment for Train 1 has been delivered to the site. Concrete work for trains 2 and 3 is over 70% complete, and the compressors for Trains 2 and 3 have been set. \n I remain optimistic that together with Bechtel, we will achieve first LNG by the end of 2024 and bring all 7 trains online before the end of 2026. During the quarter, we continue to work closely with FERC to progress the permitting approval process for trains 8 and 9 at Corpus Christi. We expect to receive our environmental assessment soon and remain confident that we will receive all necessary regulatory approvals to be able to sanction the project in 2025. And for our major growth project at Sabine Pass, the SPL expansion project. \n We submitted the full applications to FERC and DOE in February. Anatol and team continue to work towards commercializing the project. Mosach and the team managed the balance sheet and CQP's funding plan in advance of sanctioning the project, which remains targeted for 2026. In February, I highlighted my confidence in the critical role of U.S. LNG in the global energy market and the need for significant investment in and permitting additional liquefaction capacity today to meet the expected growth in global demand over the coming decades. \n The United States has an unprecedented opportunity to play a vital role in helping provide real long-term energy solutions the world over. That will improve the everyday lives of millions or billions of people while meaningfully lowering global emissions. My conviction in this, is as strong as ever, and I believe the over $40 billion brownfield infrastructure platform, we have developed best positioned Cheniere to meaningfully participate in that future growth while continuing to supply the world with our cleaner burning LNG. \n Let's further address the vast benefits and critical role of LNG on the next slide. Recently, some reports have challenged the environmental benefits of LNG relative to coal. When compared to coal, natural gas is a more efficient energy source for power generation that results in demonstrable, lower greenhouse gas emissions and traditional [air fumes], which improves air quality and public health. In fact, peer-reviewed studies examining U.S. LNG delivered to China for power generation estimate that coal-to-gas switching results in approximately 50% lower greenhouse gas emissions on a full life cycle basis. \n These findings are based on an extensive body of research, including our own peer-reviewed life cycle assessment utilizing data specific to our supply chain including operational data. We strongly disagree with recent research, which claims the opposite while utilizing cherry-picked assumptions, and that has not gone through peer review.  We expect natural gas and LNG to serve as one of the most powerful drivers of global decarbonization like it has in the U.S., where the IEA estimates that coal to gas switching has resulted in a reduction of over 0.5 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions since 2005. \n We continue to focus on full life cycle environmental performance and are working on improving our Scope 1 methane and CO2 intensity while engaging with our supply chain partners to help deploy detection and quantification technologies, to improve the life cycle emissions of our LNG, further demonstrating the sustainability as a fuel source. Beyond the environmental advantages, the reliability, dispatchability and relative affordability of natural gas is unmatched and developing economies understandably prioritize energy security, reliability and affordability ahead of climate considerations. \n In fact, global coal consumption reached 8.5 gigatons in 2023, surpassing 2022's total and setting a new all-time global consumption record with the greatest increases coming from the rapidly emerging economies of China and India. Coal to gas switching in emerging markets like these represent the most powerful and executable long-term energy solution that enables energy security and reliability while significantly improving the emissions profile of these countries. \n Simply put natural gas and LNG are currently actionable in common sense solutions to powering emerging economies around the world while lowering global emissions to meet their climate policies. The global call for energy security in recent years, particularly in Europe underscores the long-term role of natural gas in both developed and developing economies which is further evidenced by the trillions of dollars being invested in natural gas infrastructure worldwide and the fact that there are 400 million tonnes per annum of LNG facilities today but over 1,200 million tonnes per annum of regasification capacity and operations are under construction. \n Our long-term tailored LNG solutions provide customers the ability to secure long-term reliable energy supply while maintaining flexibility with regard to the energy transition plans and pathways.  At home, the LNG industry is stimulating the economy and creating thousands of jobs, all while supporting domestic production and stabilizing domestic energy prices and cash flows with our long-term predictable demand for the decades of economic resource. We are fortunate to be sitting on here in the U.S. \n It was only a few years ago, the market began highlighting the energy trilemma based on its pillars of energy security, energy equity and environmental sustainability. The case for LNG growth for decades to come remains clear to us as does the investment thesis for Cheniere. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on safely and reliably operating our 2 facilities on the Gulf Coast, while generating meaningful value to stakeholders by delivering on our promises to our customers, investors, employees, regulators and communities, supporting the energy needs of hundreds of millions of people worldwide. \n With that, I'll hand it over to Anatol to discuss the LNG market. Thank you all again for your continued support of Cheniere. All right. So Jeremy, I'll start. This is Jack. Yes, I'm very, very pleased with the progress that's being made at Corpus. If you look at the pictures, you can really see Train 1, 2 and 3 and their progress to date, we're well ahead of plan, and I am congratulatory to Bechtel, but we're not popping champagne yet, but we're very optimistic of our ability to start producing LNG this year on Train 1. But with that, I'll turn it to Zack. And Keith, this is Jack. I would say this year is all about execution. So we need to safely execute on our engineering and construction plans. We need to safely execute on our operational excellence plan, and we need to continue to commercialize the SPL expansion with Amazon and this team. So it's all about execution for us. Yes, Spiro. So first, I mean, I'm always pleased that the team has figured out ways to make our maintenance, not noticeable to you all and that we're able to spread it out and do more maintenance on times when prices or the performance because of the heat during the summer is going to be less and less impactful and less material for us. So while I'm not going to give guidance on exactly how much maintenance is left, I'll see if Zach wants to add any commentary on what it means financially. Ben, this is Jack. As you know, we have a long-term relationship with Bechtel. We work very closely with them on trying to manage those inflationary costs. The workforce is getting tighter out there. We're over 3,000 workers at Corpus right now, should be close to 4,000 by the middle part of this year. They haven't had an issue with finding workers or worker availability, which is why they're extremely ahead of schedule. \n So I'm very pleased with their performance. We know we pay for it, but they deliver and it's a match made in heaven quite honestly, when they're able to deliver those trains early, and we're able to capitalize on the benefits of having that production early. So I believe we'll be able to manage the SPL expansion costs in a way that meets all of our environmental or all of our financial criteria and make sure that we continue to add meaningful value for our shareholders. First, Jason, I'm very, very pleased with the performance of my E&C team. And as you know, at Cheniere, we try to make it look easy, and it's really not, and that's what you're hearing from all of our colleagues, peers, competitors out there that are talking about delays or maybe having trouble going from commissioning to operations. So I'm very pleased with the way we've been able to build our facilities on time and on budget and the way our handoff is from E&C to operations.\n But as far as actual quantities, I don't know, Anatol, do you have a [gas] comment. And Craig, I'll tell you in my discussions with utilities around the world, there's much more discussion around dispatchability and the flexibility that natural gas combined cycle power plants give the grid versus an intermittent resource like wind or solar as well as both as regulation. So what doesn't get talked about are [bars] or Amperage and you can't get either of them from wind or solar. They have to come from thermal or nuclear. We -- as you know, we're the only private company that actually did our own life cycle analysis and then had it peer reviewed. We had it published in the American Society of Chemical Engineers. It was commented on, it was blessed by academia and the scientists. We continue to revise it. We're using more measured data versus calculated data. We -- the inputs to our LCA is somewhere around 1,200 inputs that we plug in to come up with our cargo emission tags that we deliver on every cargo of our LNG. \n So we're getting better and better at it. We work closely with the National Petroleum Council that's part of the DOE, and we have developed a LCA that is, I'd say, a bridge. So it's a directional LCA for those people that maybe don't have the resources to calculate what their life cycle emissions is or are. And that's available now. It's an open architecture. It was released in April in Washington, so we're very pleased to be a major part of that analysis. \n And yes, I do think with this pause with the National Labs study, it will all come back at what the appropriate inputs are for the LCA. You should rest assured that Cheniere will be ready to comment on that and we're going to comment on it with real transparent data, not with guestimates. Well, this is Jack. I just want to thank you all for your support and your attention this morning. Be safe."

            "name": "Zach Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Anatol, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our first quarter 2024 results, key financial accomplishments and guidance. \n Turn to Slide 13. For the first quarter of 2024, we generated net income of approximately $502 million, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.8 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion. With today's results, we have now reported positive net income on a quarterly and cumulative trailing 4-quarter basis, 6 quarters in a row. \n Our first quarter 2024 results reflect lower international gas prices relative to last year as well as a higher proportion of our LNG being sold under long-term contracts. As Jack noted, our results also reflect some impacts to our operations at CCL following the winter freeze in Texas. Fortunately, our team had been able to forward sell several cargoes at elevated margins. which, coupled with the incremental volumes achieved at SPL partially offset these production impacts during the quarter. \n In addition, realized or locked in optimization margins in Q1 more than offset the financial impacts at Corpus to push our forecast slightly above the midpoint of our guidance ranges, already trending us in the right direction in the first half of the year. \n During the first quarter, we recognized an income 619 TBtu of physical LNG, which included 608 TBtu from our projects and 11 TBtu sourced from third parties. Approximately 90% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SPA or IPM agreements with initial terms greater than 10 years. This year, our team has continued to execute on our 2020 Vision capital allocation plan. Maintaining the year-to-date momentum we highlighted on our call in February. \n In the first quarter alone, we deployed approximately $2 billion towards shareholder returns, balance sheet management and disciplined growth and are now over $10 billion through deploying the $20-plus billion of available cash we forecast back in the fall of 2022. As we continue to progress towards the goal of $20 per share of run rate distributable cash flow. We remain committed to deploying our DCF efficiently and value accretively, having already deployed over 50% of the at least $20 billion goal through 2026 in under 40% of the time. \n During the quarter, we repurchased over 7.5 million shares for approximately $1.2 billion, marking the most active quarter for our buyback plan to date or over 3% of our shares outstanding in just 1 quarter, helping to bring our shares outstanding today to below $230 million. The buyback activity during the first quarter clearly demonstrates how the programmatic structure of our repurchase plan enables us to be very opportunistic in periods of dislocation. \n The activity last quarter accelerated the progress on our 3-year $4 billion share repurchase authorization and our progress towards the cumulative 1:1 share repurchase to debt paydown ratio we have targeted. We have now deployed over 75% of the $4 billion 3-year buyback program in just 50% of the time and narrowed the gap between debt paydown and share buybacks by over $1 billion just in the last quarter. \n There is now less than $1 billion remaining on the current authorization. So we will work with our Board on a new plan with the expectation we'll have that in place before the end of the year, while always accounting for our balanced approach to capital allocation with a focus on attractive brownfield growth at both sites. \n Moving to the balance sheet. As Jack mentioned, we issued the inaugural investment-grade bond at CEI in March and in April, we used the $1.5 billion of proceeds from these 5.65% senior notes, along with cash on hand, to retire the approximately $1.5 billion of 5.875% senior secured notes at CCH due 2025. This March versus April timing dynamic explains our elevated cash and debt balances at quarter end, with both balances since reduced by $1.5 billion, now that the CCH 25 notes were paid down with the proceeds. \n Following our playbook for strategic refinancing, this transaction serves to extend our maturity profile and reduce our interest burden while desecuring and desubordinating our balance sheet by moving debt from this BCH secured to CEI unsecured level. During the quarter, we also repaid approximately $150 million of long-term indebtedness, further addressing the 2024 SPL notes due later this month. \n In February, Moody's issued a positive outlook at both CQP and SPL, which we hope will lead to favorable rating actions as we continue to opportunistically delever and desubordinate throughout our structure this year and beyond. We also declared a dividend of $0.435 per common share for the first quarter last week and remain committed to our guidance of growing our dividend by approximately 10% annually into the mid-2020s through construction of Stage 3. And over time, we plan to steadily increase our overall payout ratio as our platform grows while still maintaining the financial flexibility essential to our comprehensive long-term capital allocation plan and growth objectives. \n At CQP, we declared a distribution of $0.81 per common unit for the first quarter, consisting of the base distribution of $0.775 and a variable amount of $0.035. Adjusting the variable component of the common unit distribution enables us to strategically preserve cash and balance sheet capacity in advance of the SPL expansion project. \n In the near term, any deleveraging at CQP or SPL can mainly be considered early investments in the SPL expansion project until we are in a position to formally sanction the project, raise financing and begin construction, which we continue to expect in 2026. During the quarter, we funded a little over $500 million of CapEx at our Stage 3 project, bringing total spend to approximately $3.5 billion in total for the project. While front-loading the equity spend has enabled considerable interest savings, we still have over $3 billion available on our CCH term loan that we plan on using as additional liquidity for CEI in the coming years through construction. \n We continue to expect to spend between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in Stage 3 CapEx this year before accounting for any draws on the CCH term loan. \n Turning now to Slide 14, where I will discuss our 2024 guidance and outlook for the year. Today, we are reconfirming our full year 2024 guidance ranges of $5.5 billion to $6 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $2.9 billion to $3.4 billion in distributable cash flow. As we've noted previously, 2024 represents our most contracted year-to-date. We still expect 2024 to represent a trough year for EBITDA as we expect our results to trend higher after this year as Stage 3 commences and eventually reach its run rate by the end of 2026. \n As a reminder, our operating and financial results and forecast reflect some degree of seasonality as typically higher winter production at our facilities, coupled with typically higher pricing international markets, can provide for a somewhat seasonal weighting of our results to the colder quarters versus the hotter ones. For the balance of the year, we don't expect meaningful changes to our earnings forecast for the remaining 3 quarters with an immaterial amount of unsold capacity remaining. We still expect to produce approximately 45 million tonnes of LNG this year, inclusive of planned maintenance at both sites, and our guidance continues to reflect only contributions from completed portfolio optimization activities as we do not forecast potential contributions from future opportunities. \n We do not forecast any contribution to revenues or EBITDA from Stage 3 in 2024.  As always, our results could be impacted by the timing of certain cargoes around year-end as well as incremental margin from further optimization, upstream and downstream of our facilities. Our DCF for 2024 could also be affected by changes in the tax code under the IRA. However, the guidance provided today is based on the current IRA tax law guidance and assumes we are subject to a minimum corporate tax of 15% this year. \n As the year progresses, we should be in a position to tighten our ranges consistent with what we've done in the past. Despite our limited opening exposure this year and the lower LNG price environment, our 2024 guidance ranges are above our 9 train run rate guidance, and we remain in very good shape to achieve our 2020 Vision capital allocation plan. \n As we look beyond 2024, our highly contracted infrastructure platform is designed to largely insulate our financial results from any potential short-term market dislocations or periods of volatility, particularly as the market absorbs LNG capacity additions later this decade. Most critically, our longer-term outlook for the global LNG market is unchanged and periods of moderated market prices and sentiment have enabled us to accelerate our capital allocation progress and put even more distance between us and the competition. \n With every dollar deployed by our team, we are positioning Cheniere for the long term with a resilient and profitable future. It is the inherent stability and long-term visibility of our contracted cash flows along with our scale that enable us to meaningfully return capital to our stakeholders while methodically pursuing further disciplined and accretive brownfield growth, and at the same time, reliably and responsibly delivering affordable, cleaner burning energy to our customers worldwide. \n That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions. Thanks, Jeremy. I'll just say, of course, we're very focused on first LNG this year, but it's really about the first few trains and how those ramp up through this year and into next to get some more meaningful millions of tonnes of LNG and make a real financial impact to '25 and make '24 more of the trough year as we've stated. As it relates to the buyback, it would be just gravy considering that when we came up with the 2020 vision and the over $20 billion of available cash, we assume the guaranteed completion dates. \n And we're talking about completion dates now that are almost a year ahead of schedule. But as we think about the buyback, basically, we guided everyone to over $10 billion would be deployed through '26 for debt paydown and buybacks, we're going to easily surpass that. And it was always the plan to reupsize the buyback plan inside of this time period as that was the only way we're going to get closer and closer to the 200 million shares over time. So now that we're under $1 billion on the buyback plan with the 7.5 million shares we bought in the last quarter, I expect that we're currently working with the Board and you should see a meaningful upside to the buyback plan later this year. There's definitely plenty of liquidity for everything to continue to be meaningful as we continue to fund Stage 3. As we grow the dividend later this year and pay down some debt as we ramp down that variable DPU at CQP in anticipation of Sabine's expansion. \n But in terms of liquidity, we have over $3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We're going to make over $3 billion of DCF based on the forecast for the year. And we still have over $3 billion of availability on the term loan at Corpus. So liquidity is not the problem. We will be methodically buying back stock over time and being as opportunistic as we can in times like this. because it's only like times like this that we're going to be able to get down to 200 million shares by the middle of the decade. \n So everything is in good shape and well placed where we'll focus on debt pay down inside the CQP and we'll focus on buybacks up at LNG. Just to keep in mind, especially compared to '22 and '23, when you think about Henry Hub shipping day rates, or just overall commodity prices on an absolute basis, they're all much lower. So it's much more difficult to see those arbitrages and make as much on the optimization side. But optimization is coming in quite well, but the numbers aren't in the hundreds of millions. We probably made 50 plus so far this year. And with some SPL outperformance so far this year, too, that's why we're already tracking above the midpoint of the EBITDA guidance despite we'll need some tick up in production at CCL for the rest of the year. \n So optimization is coming together and with a little more outperformance on production and the upstream and downstream optimization that we've seen, yes, we have a good chance of trying to get to the higher end of the range. I think this is pretty similar to what happened last year, where consensus was a little lower than our first quarter results. As folks often divide by for the EBITDA over the course of the year. The major maintenance, the planned maintenance is basically going to be, for the most part, in Q2 and Q3, which is also the time where production is lower as it's the warmer months. So you should expect a step down in EBITDA to an extent. And that's why we're still tracking well in the range and slightly above the midpoint, but that's why we didn't move the guidance range even though we had a strong first quarter. \n So expect that and then maybe in Q4, it comes back up a bit as the weather gets colder and there's not as much planned maintenance. And I'll just add, it comes back to the discipline because if we're not going to be able to build around that 6x to 7x CapEx to EBITDA, it's a lot easier to continue to just keep on buying back the stock and considering a multiple on a company like Cheniere without even accounting for like the brownfield growth prospects we have, the fact that we give run rate at 200 to 250 and we don't even show the capturing of all the optimization that every single quarter, even the past one we've done, it's unaccessibly too low when you're talking about something under 10x.\n So we will be patient on this. But clearly, we're doing the work already with Bechtel to have a decent sense, and that's why we've signed a few contracts already for the Sabine expansion. And if yes, if say there were a delay of FID by a year, give or take. That's just another $3 billion to $4 billion coming up through the system, meaning that the re-upsized buyback plan that we'll announce later this year will just be finished quicker. Well, it's not going to be this quarter, and we'll continue to work with the Board over the next few months and even quarter or so and see where we are. And honestly, it depends on how -- how fast we deploy that $950 million. The more that the price stays around this level, yes, it will be sooner rather than later. But the commitment is by later this year, we'll have an upsized plan. and keep on trucking along to get that share count down to closer to $200 million."
