        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Kathy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everybody to the PNC Financial Services Group Earnings Conference Call  As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now turn the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bryan Gill. Sir, please go ahead.\nBryan Gill: Well, thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nBill Demchak: Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everybody. As you've seen this morning, we had a solid fourth quarter and full year 2020 amidst a challenging operating environment. Over the course of the year, we grew loans and deposits, delivered positive operating leverage and executed well on all of our strategic priorities. Our balance sheet finished the year in a very strong position, record levels of capital and liquidity, and significant credit reserves. In addition, we grew tangible book value per share 17% year-over-year. While the economy improved modestly this quarter and we're encouraged by the rollout of the vaccines, we continue to operate amidst the pandemic, a low rate environment and weak loan demand. And before Rob walks you through the full details of our results, I wanted to share a few high level observations. First, the investments we've made over the years in talent and technology have allowed us to navigate this pandemic, the related economic crisis and the widespread social unrest while supporting our stakeholders and coming out stronger as a company. In addition to taking the steps to help keep our employees and customers safe, we provided billions of dollars of credit to our clients. We granted $14.8 billion in loan modifications and registered more than 70,000 loans worth approximately $13 billion through the federal government's first round of the Paycheck Protection Program. And our team is actively working with our clients right now through the second round of PPP. In response to the widespread social unrest and as part of our efforts to help address systemic racism, we committed $1 billion to advance social justice and economic empowerment among Black Americans in low and moderate income communities. And as you're aware, in the second quarter of 2020, we sold our passive equity stake in BlackRock. In November, announced our plan to redeploy those proceeds to acquire BBVA USA. Since that announcement, we spent a lot of time with BBVA's employees and have become even more excited about our combination, given their talent in high growth markets and the similarities in how we serve clients, manage risk and support our communities. This transaction will create a leading national franchise, significantly accelerate our growth and enhance our profitability. And finally, I'd like to close by thanking our employees for their steadfast commitment to our customers through a very challenging year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our results, and then we'll take your questions.\nRob Reilly: Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we've reported fourth quarter net income of $1.5 billion or $3.26 per diluted common share, resulting in full year 2020 net income from continuing operations of $3 billion or $6.36 per diluted common share. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. During the quarter, lower utilization and soft loan demand drove a $7 billion or 3% decline in loans. And low rates pressured investment securities, which declined $5 billion or 5%. Our cash balances at the Federal Reserve grew to $76 billion in the fourth quarter. Our elevated liquidity position is a result of continued deposit growth as well as lower loan and securities balances. On the liability side, deposit balances averaged $359 billion and were up $9 billion or 3% linked quarter. Borrowed funds decreased $5 billion compared to the third quarter as we used our strong liquidity position to continue to reduce debt. Our tangible book value was $97.43 per common share as of December 31st, an increase of 2% linked quarter and 17% year-over-year. And as of December 31, 2020, our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 12.1%. In regard to capital return, our Board recently approved a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.15 per share or $500 million. And consistent with the fed mandate, we had no share repurchases during the fourth quarter. Our expectations for share repurchases in 2021 remains the same, as we stated this past December that is, we'll refrain from share repurchases, excluding employee benefit related purchases during the period leading up to our pending BBVA USA transaction close date, expected to be mid summer 2021. Following the close, all else being equal and subject to CCAR 2021, we'd expect to resume share repurchases in the second half of the year. Slide 5 shows our average loans and deposits in more detail. Average loan balances of $246 billion in the fourth quarter were down $7.3 billion or 3% compared to the third quarter. This decline included a $5.3 billion decrease in commercial loan balances, which was broad based, reflecting lower loan utilization and softer loan production, partially offset by higher multifamily warehouse lending. In our C&IB segment, utilization rates are currently running at historic lows and approximately 2.5% below pre pandemic levels as customers continue to maintain strong liquidity positions, evidenced by high levels of deposits. Consumer loans declined $2 billion and balances were lower across all consumer categories. Compared to the same period a year ago, total average loans grew 3% or $7 billion.\nBryan Gill: Kathy, could you please open up the line for questions?\nOperator:  And our first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: I had a question on the outlook here for revenue, full year or stable. And obviously, that's a stand-alone basis, right? I just wanted to understand how you get there and what's going on, given the fact that the guide for NII in 1Q is down. And so can you talk through what you're doing and how much of that is loan growth? Thanks.\nRob Reilly: So I'm glad you asked that question because I included that in the forecast in terms of our guidance for the full year that we expect total revenues to be stable and inside that, our current net interest income forecast is down modestly. But we do acknowledge potential for deposit growth and further rate steepening in excess of our current forecast. So there's potential upside there\u2026\nBill Demchak: And it's offset by higher fees.\nRob Reilly: In terms of total revenue. Yes, in terms of that. That's right. In regard to the NII, it's tough. As you take a look in terms of the rate backdrop, we had headwinds all during 2020 and we expect that to continue through 2021. We will put more money to work on the securities balances. We do expect loan growth. And there may be some room in terms on the liability side to reduce some of those costs. So that's how we get to the NII component.\nBill Demchak: Betsy, one of the internal debates that we're having -- so the forecast stays as the forecast stays. But one of the internal debates that there's no winner on is this basic notion that as fed continues the size of their balance sheet and grows it and we have loan growth towards the back end of 2021, that drives deposit growth. It's a closed system. And as that happens, PNC benefits disproportionately, at least has and I suspect will, given some constraints on the largest banks on deposit growth, which in turn gives us NII. So we kind of say, fine, call NII flat but there's a macro variable in here that will hit the industry as a function of loan growth and what the fed does, it's going to drive this opportunity.\nBetsy Graseck: Maybe you could speak a little bit to the loan growth and where that's going to come from, that's probably the biggest single debate point that we're having with investors right now. What will drive that back up?\nBill Demchak: So Rob can jump in here. But a chunk of it simply comes back because utilizations are so low. So as the economy comes back on, you just see utilization and the basic revolvers we have. But the other issues, the delevering of the consumer balances ought to pick up once the vaccine is widely distributed and people kind of go back to more normalized behavior. That remains to be seen but I think those are the two biggest opportunity sets.\nRob Reilly: And some consumer on the back end of the year, that's normalized.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.\nScott Siefers: Rob, in response to the last question, you alluded to the possibility of potentially investing a little of the securities portfolio. And I feel like you guys just have such a mass of money just sitting at the fed. So we've had this back up in higher rates. How much, in your mind, more attractive is it to potentially invest some of that stuff that's just sort of sitting there earning virtually nothing at this point?\nBill Demchak: Well, it's more attractive than it was a couple of months ago. I think you would have seen, right, that the outright security balances declined just as we got into the low rates and the prepays. We have been more aggressively investing money of recent. We'll continue to do that. We have a lot to go, as you point out. We don't do it all at once. And you should assume that will accelerate into a steepening curve and moderate into a flattening curve, as you would expect. But we have an awful lot of money to put to work. And then that issue compounds, again, if we get the deposit growth that at least I expect is going to happen across the industry given the macro factors.\nRob Reilly: And that's that piece that we talked about that could be potentially above our current forecast.\nScott Siefers: And then the second question, I know it's not necessarily huge for me, but I think a lot of investors are trying to figure out what is this new round of PPP going to look like? Just sort of qualitatively, how are you guys thinking about your own participation in it? And to the degree that any benefit is baked into the guidance for 2021, how does that end up looking quantitatively as well?\nRob Reilly: I can answer that, so particularly as it relates to the first quarter. So we will participate in the second wave. We anticipate that the total balances, because the program is smaller, will be less than the first wave. But to just give you numbers, we finished 2020 with the average balances under the first PPP program of $12.5 billion. We expect $2 billion of forgiveness in the first quarter, so that first wave would be about $10.5 billion. And then for the second wave, we expect to originate approximately $4 billion in the first quarter. So that would take our total PPP in the first quarter to about $14.5 billion. So that's how I size it and that's how I think it. Beyond that, we'll have to see because the levels of forgiveness and how that goes is fluid.\nOperator:  And our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: If I can follow up on the last question, Rob, can you help us understand -- I know there's so many moving parts with Part 1 and Part 2. You had said, I think, you had less forgiveness in the fourth quarter than you expected. Can you help us understand just like what the PPP benefit to NII was in '20? And then how much are you expecting in '21, or how much that informs that slightly down NII?\nRob Reilly: Yes. I think it is probably, Ken, you have to look at the 2021 first quarter and give you a number. Of that $14.5 billion that we expect to have in total PPP loans, the NII will be approximately $140 million. And inside that $30 million -- and these are approximate numbers. Approximately $30 million represents the forgiveness of that $2 billion that we expect from program one.\nKen Usdin: And then there will be some moving parts with regards to like run rating versus forgiveness as we go through the year as well?\nRob Reilly: Yes, that's right. And we'll keep you posted, but that's my best thinking for the first quarter.\nKen Usdin: And the second question is following on your BBVA second half PPNR comments, Rob, just wondering, is that $600 million also inclusive of the initial saves you're expecting this year? Or is that just like a, what they're bringing over kind of on day one? Because I think you did say you were expecting some saves to happen in the back half.\nRob Reilly: Yes, it's that, Ken. There are some saves in the back half that are included in that number.\nKen Usdin: And has there anything changed with regards to your expected trajectory of the timing around when you think the saves would come in?\nRob Reilly: No, our original assumptions are holding.\nOperator:  And I have a follow-up question from the line of Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler.\nScott Siefers: I guess one of the questions that I've gotten about you guys over the course of the last couple of months since the BBVA transaction was announced is just given the somewhat different credit profiles between legacy PNC and the BBVA franchise. How much of that loan book that you'll carry over do you anticipate keeping? And will there be some sort of a runoff portfolio that sort of impairs what would eventually be a higher growth trajectory from that franchise or are we going to be sort of steady state and all the kind of stuff will get rationalized in the upfront mark?\nBill Demchak: There's a lot embedded in that question. But there's parts of BBVA's balance sheet that and it's more sectors, it's not necessarily credit risk but the things we choose to focus on versus what we don't. So there's parts of their balance sheet that will run off over time. At the same time, because of many of our lending specialties and the presence we'll have in the market, we expect that we will grow balances in the new franchise. So you're going to see both. Our base assumptions assume a rundown, I don't know when the trough is, Rob, but a rundown in balance sheet for a short period of time before we sort of offset it with new growth.\nRob Reilly: Yes, at the beginning, 2022 and 2023. So there is some revenue reconfiguration along those lines.\nBill Demchak: Yes.\nRob Reilly: But of course, we'll keep you up to speed. We don't own the bank yet. So that will be something that once we close, we'll be able to give you more color.\nOperator: And our question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: You had positive operating leverage last year, your efficiency improved. Fourth quarter, it didn't look as good, though. Was there anything that's unusual? And also your guidance for next year is for flat operating leverage when I know you guys pride yourself in having positive operating leverage on a core basis. Thanks.\nRob Reilly: Well, the fourth quarter, most of those expenses that jumped, as you saw, were incentive compensation for much, much higher activity, particularly in our Harris Williams unit. So those are good expenses. When Harris Williams and activity goes up, that's a good thing but there's obviously expenses associated with that. And then there are some seasonal things that we expect. But you're right, for the full year, our expense management was successful. Full positive operating leverage for the year, which was our objective, and we did that. When you look at 2021, we're going to fight for it. We're not folding on that. We've got revenues stable and expensive stable. So it's going to require tight expense management. But yes, we're going to battle for it.\nMike Mayo: And as far as BBVA, your loan loss reserve assumptions might have improved since you had the Pfizer vaccine out, you didn't have Moderna or J&J. So would the outlook be a little bit better and the same reason you had reserve releases when you have a better outlook for BBVA?\nBill Demchak: We didn't even actually have Pfizer out when those were put together. So in theory, you're right, Mike.\nRob Reilly: Well, again, we don't own the bank. They're going to release their results\u2026\nBill Demchak: These are in our assumptions\u2026\nRob Reilly: Yes. But as in our assumptions, all else being equal, yes, they'd be less.\nMike Mayo: I guess we just have to wait for BBVA's results to come out and then we can hopefully get an update from you.\nOperator:  And our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.\nBill Carcache: I wanted to follow up on your comments about investing more of the securities portfolio into a curve steepening. Some of the dynamics around QE have led agency MBS spreads over treasuries to turn negative. And you guys along with most other banks have a substantial portion of your securities portfolio is invested in agency MBS? So it seems like the benefits of the steeper curve are being tempered somewhat by those dynamics. Can you give a little bit of color on where you're seeing the opportunity to invest on the security side? And then maybe on the lending side, if you could remind us what percentage of the loan portfolio is anchored to the short versus the long end of the interest rate complex. And just frame how we think about the benefit to P&C of a steeper curve on the lending side as well.\nBill Demchak: You're way too far into the weeds. But you should assume that for now, in terms of where current spreads against the mix of the portfolio, we'd otherwise normally be buying, our reinvestment yield is about 80 basis points. How we get there, I'm not going to go into detail. But that's on average, what we would be purchasing today. The fixed and floating component and the one and three month LIBOR component of our loans. I don't remember those numbers off the top of my head.\nRob Reilly: Yes. I mean we're short -- on the commercial loans, they tend to be three year type commitments and on the consumer, it's floating.\nBill Demchak: The other thing that makes us somewhat unique is our entire debt stack is floating as well. And you see that in our liability costs. That's one of the reason our wholesale funding cost has dropped, last time I looked, much more materially than most of our competitors.\nBill Carcache: And separately, on expenses, some investors have expressed a little bit of concern that after so many years of you guys having the benefit of being able to reinvest a strong growth from BlackRock into the business that the loss of that strong growth is going to make it more challenging to continue to invest at the same pace without hurting the efficiency ratio. Rob, I heard your CIP target sound like they're unchanged for the year. But I was hoping you guys could just broadly speak to that notion.\nBill Demchak: I don't fully understand\u2026\nBryan Gill: It's more driven by CIP rather than\u2026\nBill Demchak: Yes, I mean our investment capability obviously comes from just the firm growing and then recycling expenses, which we'll continue to do. BlackRock's growth through time in terms of revenue to us was helpful. Of course, as we go forward here and assuming we close, which is a good assumption of the BBVA acquisition, we have a whole new set of expenses in effect to recycle that gives rise to this investment\u2026\nRob Reilly: And revenues, so it won't slow down our investment\u2026\nBill Demchak: At all, yes.\nBill Carcache: If I can squeeze one more in on credit. So I had a question on how I think about the excess capital as it relates to Slide 12. So in the absence of the BBVA deal, one could make the case that, that 1.54% reserve rate on day one is the level that we should revert to once we get past COVID. And so any level of reserves above that could be viewed as excess. But can you speak to the reasonableness of that thought process? And then maybe frame for us how to think about the onboarding of BBVA onto this slide and what it would mean for your reserve rate and excess capital?\nBill Demchak: I don't think -- I mean, look, our reserve as of today and presumably their reserve as of today is reflective of best expectations of the forward economy here. So they'll release their results and you'll be able to look at that CRs. I don't know how we can\u2026\nRob Reilly: You have sort of two parts to that question. One was the BBVA USA overlay and that's to come when their results come out. The second question just is sort of what is the normal level of reserves under CECL. 1.54 was our day one after CECL level were those normal times maybe and if so, that's the normal level.\nOperator:  And our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Can you guys share with us, and I apologize if you've addressed this already, I may have missed it. Obviously, prior to the BBVA transaction, you guys were growing organically in the commercial footprint around the country. Is that strategy still underway or has that been put on pause as you integrate the BBVA transaction?\nRob Reilly: No, not on pause, Gerard. So naturally, in cases where the BBVA USA footprint was where we were going to go, that's part of that transaction. But everything else holds in terms of opening offices, both consumer and commercial throughout the country.\nBill Demchak: Yes. And the other thing, Gerard, is going back to kind of the prior question on investments. We're actually ramping up investments in those markets prior to close. So we're not going to wait to close before we think about the totality of the products and services we want in a particular market. We're going to have it ideally the day we close and then convert.\nGerard Cassidy: You guys gave very good detail on your nonperforming assets. And I noticed in Table 11 that you had some nice rise in return to performing status of nonaccrual loans. Can you share us any color on what success you had in bringing them back into performing status?\nRob Reilly: I think, just in general, Gerard, it's just some of these companies have adapted, particularly on the commercial side, have adapted to the new economy and are actually performing well. Simple as that.\nOperator: There are no other questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to you, Mr. Gill.\nBryan Gill: Okay. Well, thank you all for your support of PNC, and we look forward to working with you in 2021. Thank you.\nBill Demchak: Thanks, everybody.\nRob Reilly: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude the call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Rob Reilly",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we've reported fourth quarter net income of $1.5 billion or $3.26 per diluted common share, resulting in full year 2020 net income from continuing operations of $3 billion or $6.36 per diluted common share. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. During the quarter, lower utilization and soft loan demand drove a $7 billion or 3% decline in loans. And low rates pressured investment securities, which declined $5 billion or 5%. Our cash balances at the Federal Reserve grew to $76 billion in the fourth quarter. Our elevated liquidity position is a result of continued deposit growth as well as lower loan and securities balances. On the liability side, deposit balances averaged $359 billion and were up $9 billion or 3% linked quarter. Borrowed funds decreased $5 billion compared to the third quarter as we used our strong liquidity position to continue to reduce debt. Our tangible book value was $97.43 per common share as of December 31st, an increase of 2% linked quarter and 17% year-over-year.

Following the close, all else being equal and subject to CCAR 2021, we'd expect to resume share repurchases in the second half of the year. Slide 5 shows our average loans and deposits in more detail. Average loan balances of $246 billion in the fourth quarter were down $7.3 billion or 3% compared to the third quarter. This decline included a $5.3 billion decrease in commercial loan balances, which was broad based, reflecting lower loan utilization and softer loan production, partially offset by higher multifamily warehouse lending. In our C&IB segment, utilization rates are currently running at historic lows and approximately 2.5% below pre pandemic levels as customers continue to maintain strong liquidity positions, evidenced by high levels of deposits. Consumer loans declined $2 billion and balances were lower across all consumer categories. Compared to the same period a year ago, total average loans grew 3% or $7 billion. So I'm glad you asked that question because I included that in the forecast in terms of our guidance for the full year that we expect total revenues to be stable and inside that, our current net interest income forecast is down modestly. But we do acknowledge potential for deposit growth and further rate steepening in excess of our current forecast. So there's potential upside there... In terms of total revenue. Yes, in terms of that. That's right. In regard to the NII, it's tough. As you take a look in terms of the rate backdrop, we had headwinds all during 2020 and we expect that to continue through 2021.

I think it is probably, Ken, you have to look at the 2021 first quarter and give you a number.

            "name": "Bill Demchak",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everybody. As you've seen this morning, we had a solid fourth quarter and full year 2020 amidst a challenging operating environment. Over the course of the year, we grew loans and deposits, delivered positive operating leverage and executed well on all of our strategic priorities. Our balance sheet finished the year in a very strong position, record levels of capital and liquidity, and significant credit reserves. In addition, we grew tangible book value per share 17% year-over-year. While the economy improved modestly this quarter and we're encouraged by the rollout of the vaccines, we continue to operate amidst the pandemic, a low rate environment and weak loan demand. And before Rob walks you through the full details of our results, I wanted to share a few high level observations. First, the investments we've made over the years in talent and technology have allowed us to navigate this pandemic, the related economic crisis and the widespread social unrest while supporting our stakeholders and coming out stronger as a company. In addition to taking the steps to help keep our employees and customers safe, we provided billions of dollars of credit to our clients. We granted $14.8 billion in loan modifications and registered more than 70,000 loans worth approximately $13 billion through the federal government's first round of the Paycheck Protection Program. And our team is actively working with our clients right now through the second round of PPP. In response to the widespread social unrest and as part of our efforts to help address systemic racism, we committed $1 billion to advance social justice and economic empowerment among Black Americans in low and moderate income communities. And as you're aware, in the second quarter of 2020, we sold our passive equity stake in BlackRock. In November, announced our plan to redeploy those proceeds to acquire BBVA USA. Since that announcement, we spent a lot of time with BBVA's employees and have become even more excited about our combination, given their talent in high growth markets and the similarities in how we serve clients, manage risk and support our communities. This transaction will create a leading national franchise, significantly accelerate our growth and enhance our profitability. And finally, I'd like to close by thanking our employees for their steadfast commitment to our customers through a very challenging year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our results, and then we'll take your questions. And it's offset by higher fees. Betsy, one of the internal debates that we're having -- so the forecast stays as the forecast stays. But one of the internal debates that there's no winner on is this basic notion that as fed continues the size of their balance sheet and grows it and we have loan growth towards the back end of 2021, that drives deposit growth. It's a closed system. And as that happens, PNC benefits disproportionately, at least has and I suspect will, given some constraints on the largest banks on deposit growth, which in turn gives us NII. So we kind of say, fine, call NII flat but there's a macro variable in here that will hit the industry as a function of loan growth and what the fed does, it's going to drive this opportunity. So Rob can jump in here. But a chunk of it simply comes back because utilizations are so low. So as the economy comes back on, you just see utilization and the basic revolvers we have. But the other issues, the delevering of the consumer balances ought to pick up once the vaccine is widely distributed and people kind of go back to more normalized behavior. That remains to be seen but I think those are the two biggest opportunity sets. Well, it's more attractive than it was a couple of months ago. I think you would have seen, right, that the outright security balances declined just as we got into the low rates and the prepays. We have been more aggressively investing money of recent. We'll continue to do that. We have a lot to go, as you point out. We don't do it all at once. And you should assume that will accelerate into a steepening curve and moderate into a flattening curve, as you would expect. But we have an awful lot of money to put to work. And then that issue compounds, again, if we get the deposit growth that at least I expect is going to happen across the industry given the macro factors. There's a lot embedded in that question. But there's parts of BBVA's balance sheet that and it's more sectors, it's not necessarily credit risk but the things we choose to focus on versus what we don't. So there's parts of their balance sheet that will run off over time. At the same time, because of many of our lending specialties and the presence we'll have in the market, we expect that we will grow balances in the new franchise. So you're going to see both. Our base assumptions assume a rundown, I don't know when the trough is, Rob, but a rundown in balance sheet for a short period of time before we sort of offset it with new growth. Yes. We didn't even actually have Pfizer out when those were put together. So in theory, you're right, Mike. These are in our assumptions... You're way too far into the weeds. But you should assume that for now, in terms of where current spreads against the mix of the portfolio, we'd otherwise normally be buying, our reinvestment yield is about 80 basis points. How we get there, I'm not going to go into detail. But that's on average, what we would be purchasing today. The fixed and floating component and the one and three month LIBOR component of our loans. I don't remember those numbers off the top of my head. The other thing that makes us somewhat unique is our entire debt stack is floating as well. And you see that in our liability costs. That's one of the reason our wholesale funding cost has dropped, last time I looked, much more materially than most of our competitors. I don't fully understand... Yes, I mean our investment capability obviously comes from just the firm growing and then recycling expenses, which we'll continue to do. BlackRock's growth through time in terms of revenue to us was helpful. Of course, as we go forward here and assuming we close, which is a good assumption of the BBVA acquisition, we have a whole new set of expenses in effect to recycle that gives rise to this investment... At all, yes. I don't think -- I mean, look, our reserve as of today and presumably their reserve as of today is reflective of best expectations of the forward economy here. So they'll release their results and you'll be able to look at that CRs. I don't know how we can... Yes. And the other thing, Gerard, is going back to kind of the prior question on investments. We're actually ramping up investments in those markets prior to close. So we're not going to wait to close before we think about the totality of the products and services we want in a particular market. We're going to have it ideally the day we close and then convert. Thanks, everybody."

At this time, I would like everyone - welcome everyone to the PNC Financial Services Group Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bryan Gill. Sir, please go ahead.\nBryan Gill: Well, thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. A cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials, as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These materials are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of October 14, 2020 and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\nWilliam Demchak: Thanks, Brian, and good morning everybody. Hope everybody is safe and well. You've seen that amidst continued uncertainty on many fronts, PNC delivered solid third quarter results. We grew revenue led by noninterest income, which included a bounce back in consumer fees on higher volumes. We managed expenses which allowed us to generate positive operating leverage of over 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date period. And our provision for credit losses was substantially less than last quarter. On the flip side, net interest income fell from the second quarter given the low interest rate environment and weak loan demand. Despite growth in customers and commitments our loans outstanding declined due to lower utilization rates, including the pay-off of commercial lines of credit that were drawn early in the pandemic. And while we continue to experience strong deposit growth, the current environment has made it more challenging to put those deposits to work. While the provision and charge-offs were down quarter-on-quarter, non-performers continue to rise, especially in a high impact COVID areas that Rob is going to discuss in a little bit more detail. Notwithstanding these challenges, we feel that PNC is well positioned with very strong capital, liquidity and loan loss reserves. Needless to say there are several significant upcoming events including the next round of stress tests, the election, and PPP forgiveness that may impact the industry and our borrowers, which underscores the importance of our strong position. We're confident that the actions we've taken position us to both support our clients and communities and take advantage of potential investment opportunities if they arise to enhance shareholder value. I want to thank our employees who despite the various challenges of the pandemic continue to execute on our strategic priorities including ongoing investments in our national expansion and digital offerings, all while helping our customers navigate financial hardship, and other challenges. During the quarter we opened retail solution centers in Nashville, Houston, Denver, Boston and Dallas and filled out corporate teams in the recently opened Seattle and Portland markets. In 2021 we will continue our middle market expansion into San Antonio, Austin and San Diego. The ability to expose our model to these demographically attractive markets continues to generate strong returns. And with that I'm going to turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our third quarter results, and then we'll be happy to take your questions.\nRobert Reilly: Great. Thanks, Bill and good morning everyone. As you've seen, we've reported third quarter net income of $1.5 billion or $3.39 per diluted common share. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4, and is presented on an average basis. On the asset side total loans declined $15 billion to $253 billion linked quarter. Investment securities of $91 billion increased $2 billion or 2% linked quarter. But on a spot basis declined $7 billion, primarily due to significant prepayment activity and maturities at quarter-end. Our cash balances at the Federal Reserve to average $60 billion compared with $34 billion in the second quarter. The increase was a result of continued deposit growth and the full quarter impact of proceeds from the sale of our equity investment in BlackRock. On the liability side deposit balances averaged $350 billion, and were up $15 billion or 5% linked quarter. Borrowed funds decreased $10 billion compared to the second quarter as we used our strong liquidity position to reduce borrowings primarily with the Federal Home Loan Bank. And our tangible book value was $95.71 per common share as of September 30, an increase of 2% linked quarter and 16% year-over-year. As you can see on Slide 5, our capital reserve and liquidity positions remain strong. As of September 30, 2020 our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 11.7%. Our Board recently approved a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.15 per share. And as you know the Fed has authorized dividends for the fourth quarter, again subject to amounts not exceeding the average of net income for the preceding four quarters. On this basis, our fourth quarter dividend is 26% of that rolling number. In regard to share repurchases and in accordance with the Federal Reserve's directive, we'll continue to suspend repurchases through the fourth quarter of 2020. Our loan loss reserve levels are 2.58%, up slightly from 2.55% at the end of June. And our liquidity coverage ratios continue to significantly exceed the regulatory minimum requirements as we remain core-funded with a low cost deposit base. Slide 6 shows our average loans and deposits in more detail. Average loan balances of $253 billion in the third quarter were down $15 billion or 6% compared to the second quarter. This decline reflected a $13.7 billion decrease in commercial loan balances as new loan production was more than offset by broad-based lower utilization. In our C&IB segment virtually all of the draw-downs that occurred in the first quarter, has since paid back and our utilization rates are currently running approximately 1% below pre-pandemic levels. Consumer loans declined approximately $1.3 billion across all categories except for residential mortgage which increased. Compared to the same period a year ago average loans grew 6% or $15 billion. As the Slide shows the yield on our loan balances is 3.32%, a 5 basis point decline in the second quarter and the rate paid on our interest bearing deposits was 12 basis points and 11 basis point decline linked quarter. Average deposit balances of $350 billion increased $15 billion or 5%. Commercial deposits grew reflecting the enhanced liquidity positions of our customers, and consumer deposits also grew primarily due to government stimulus and lower consumer spending. Year-over-year deposits increased $71 billion or 26%. As you can see on Slide 7, third quarter total revenue was $4.3 billion up $205 million linked quarter or 5%. Net interest income of $2.5 billion was down $43 million or 2% compared to the second quarter as lower earning asset yields and a decline in loan balances more than offset the benefit of lower funding costs and an extra day in the quarter. Our net interest margin decreased to 2.39%, down 13 basis points linked quarter, reflecting the impact of higher balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank, which average $60 billion for the quarter. Fed cash balances in excess of our LCR requirements were approximately $40 billion, which represented 25 basis points of compression to our net interest margin. Noninterest income of $1.8 billion increased $248 million or 16% linked quarter. Fee revenue of $1.3 billion increased $62 million or 5% compared to the second quarter. Asset management revenue increased $16 million or 8% primarily due to higher average equity markets. Consumer services and services charges on deposits in total increased by a $100 million due to higher consumer activity and a decrease in fee waivers. Corporate services declined $33 million or 6% as higher treasury management product revenue was more than offset by lower advisory related fees. Residential mortgage revenue declined $21 million or 13% driven by both lower servicing fees and lower loan sales revenue. Other noninterest income of $457 million increased $186 million and included a positive valuation adjustment of private equity investments, compared with a negative valuation adjustment in the second quarter of a similar magnitude. The positive valuation adjustment was partially offset by lower capital markets related revenue. Noninterest expense increased $16 million or less than 1% compared to the second quarter. Provision for credit losses was $52 million, a decrease of $2.4 billion as a provision expense for our commercial portfolio was largely offset by a provision recapture in our consumer portfolio. And our effective tax rate was 9.8%. The lower rate was primarily related to increased tax credit - during tax credits during the quarter. For the fourth quarter we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 13%. Turning to Slide 8. During the third quarter, we generated positive operating leverage of 4% in both the year-over-year quarter and the year-to-date comparisons. As a result, our efficiency ratio improved to 59% in the third quarter of 2020 compared to 62% for both the prior year third quarter and the nine months ended September 30th, 2019. While the current environment presents revenue challenges from low rates and pandemic related pressures, we remain deliberate and disciplined around our expense management. As we previously stated, we have a goal to reduce cost by $300 million in 2020 through our continuous improvement program, and we are confident we will achieve our full year target. As you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments. Slide 9, is an update regarding specific industries we've identified as most likely to be impacted by the effects of the pandemic. Our outstanding loan balances as of September 30 to these industries were $18.3 billion or $16.4 billion, excluding PPP loans. These balances declined 7% compared to the second quarter, primarily due to pay-downs. While we still have an experienced material charge-offs in these industries we do expect to see charge-offs increase over time should current economic trends continue. Commercial and industrial loan balances in this category, totaled $10.5 billion on September 30th declining approximately $1 billion or 9% compared to the prior quarter. Nonperforming loans in these industries remain relatively low at 1% of loans outstanding, but we're continuing to see downgrades with the greatest stress continuing to be in leisure and recreation. Looking at the lower half of the slide commercial real estate loans in this category totaled $7.8 billion at the end of the third quarter, declining $300 million or 4% compared to the prior quarter. Nonperforming loans increased approximately $180 million and downgrades continue to occur primarily in retail and lodging. Correspondingly, our reserves on our total commercial real estate portfolio have increased to 2.17% from 1.33% in the second quarter. Moving to Slide 10. We have seen a significant reduction in the number of consumers, and small businesses requesting hardship assistance. At the peak this summer we have granted modifications to more than 300,000 consumer and small business accounts representing approximately $13.7 billion of loans. $6.9 billion of these loans were government guaranteed or investor-owned which present very little credit risk to PNC. Of the remaining $6.8 billion of loans that did present credit risk, more than $5 billion have rolled off payment assistance and 92% of those accounts are current or less than 30 days past due. As a result, we had $1.7 billion of consumer and small business balances in some form of payment assistance as of September 30th. Of those balances approximately 85% are secured, and more than 60% of these accounts have made a payment in their last cycle. On the commercial side, we're also continuing to selectively grant loan modifications based on each individual borrowers situation. Within our C&IB segment approximately $700 million of loan balances were in deferral as of September 30th. When combining consumer and commercial customers, loans on deferral posing credit risk to PNC approximate 1% of total loan outstandings. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 11. Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $155 million, down $81 million from the second quarter. Commercial net charge-offs were $38 million and consumer net charge-offs were $117 million, both down linked quarter. Annualized net charge-offs to total loans was 24 basis points. Total delinquencies of $1.2 billion at September 30th declined $72 million, or 5%. Consumer loan delinquencies decreased $41 million and commercial loan delinquencies declined $31 million. Nonperforming loans increased $209 million, or 11% compared to June 30. The increase was primarily driven by commercial real estate borrowers in the high impact COVID 19 industries. As you can see the allowance for credit losses to loans was 2.58% at quarter end, up slightly from last quarter. We believe that our reserves sufficiently reflect the life of loan losses in the current portfolio. Slide 12 highlights the components of the change in our allowance for credit losses year-to-date, which have increased $3.4 billion since December 31st, 2019. As a result our allowance for credit losses to total loans was 2.58% and our allowance to nonperforming loans was 276%. Our reserves have increased materially this year due to the adoption of CECL, and significant changes in the macroeconomic outlook during the first half of the year. In the third quarter portfolio changes primarily driven by lower loan balances reduced reserves by $158 million. In addition, our economic outlook improved modestly during the quarter, but this was offset by increased reserves for both commercial and consumer borrowers adversely impacted by the pandemic. In total, this resulted in a $150 million decline in our reserves to $6.4 billion. In summary PNC posted solid third quarter results. And we believe our balance sheet is well positioned for this challenging environment. For the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter of 2020, we expect average loans to decline low single digits. We expect net interest income to be stable. We expect core fee income to be stable. We expect other noninterest income to be between $275 million and $325 million, resulting in our expectation that total noninterest income will be down in the high single-digit range. We expect total noninterest expense to be up approximately 1%, and in regard to net charge-offs, we expect fourth quarter levels to be between $200 million and $250 million. Importantly, after taking all this into account, we're on pace to deliver positive operating leverage between 3% and 4% for the full year of 2020. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\nJohn Pancari: On the loan loss reserve, it looks like you release reserves a bit in the quarter, although your ACL percentage increased - given the loan balance decline? Is it fair to assume that if we do see charge-offs continue to increase from here like in the fourth quarter, for example that we would expect that you probably still will not match those charge-offs with provision and accordingly continue to put up loan loss reserve releases?\nWilliam Demchak: There is a lot of variables that kind of go into that answer, John. But remember again, when we put up the second quarter reserve the assumption based on our economic forecast in the model. So that was, that we covered all of the losses we knew about at that point in time. At the margin, the economy has gotten perhaps a little bit better on the forecast. And so, we're kind of as charge-offs go up. We're using and effective reserves that we provided for in the second quarter. So that all else equal, should continue unless we have deterioration from our current forecast and what the economy is doing. But the general principle is all else equal as loans run down and charge-offs go through, that's what we've reserved for.\nRobert Reilly: Yes, that's right.\nJohn Pancari: And then on that same topic, the charge-off trajectory, just given what you expect in terms of the ongoing migration you saw, you indicated that the nonperformers saw some pressure. Is, when do you expect that you will see the greatest pressure in charge-offs build as this plays out? Are we looking more like the first half of next year is where we get the greatest upside pressure in terms of loss content?\nWilliam Demchak: Again, it depends on a lot of things, not the least of which is what fiscal stimulus they put out there, if any. But all else equal, it probably start showing up in the second half of next year. My own belief is, we're probably going to see more pressure on COVID sensitive industries, real estate earlier on, and then consumers flow through as we get into the back half of next year. But it all depends, where the consumer number in my view is going to be highly dependent on whether they provide more fiscal stimulus, which I think they absolutely need to do.\nRobert Reilly: John, I would just add it on that. I think it\u2019s all speculation at this point, but mid 2021, feels right.\nJohn Pancari: If I could just ask one more, on the, just to ask the M&A question in a different way Bill, if we get a Biden victory next month, and political environment potentially could move more against a big bank deals. How does that influence your appetite for a larger deal? Could you pursue smaller bank deals given that or possibly just view buybacks more attractively? Just want to get your thoughts.\nWilliam Demchak: Look, you're making a whole bunch of assumptions in there. The regulation as I understand it as it's written in the laws. I understand its written is basically to the extent that we were to do deal and not cause a systemic risk to the economy. Ultimately, it has to go through approval process to be approved. They can delay it, they can hold hearings they can do all sorts of different things. But basically it gets approved. So even in a change in administration the assumption that somehow they either change laws on this particular issue, even if they switch governors that the regulatory process is still the same. So I don't know that that's a real risk. I would say that as we've always said that the smaller deals aren't off the table, but they require a fair amount of work for less total return, in effect. Can we do a bunch of them? Yes, we could do a bunch of them over time.\nJohn Pancari: Got it, okay, that's helpful. Thank you.\nRobert Reilly: There is a lot of things to play out. I'd say, John, a lot of things to play out, and our thinking generally hasn't changed.\nWilliam Demchak: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nKen Usdin: Thanks for taking the question. Just quick question, couple questions on NII, just nice to see that you guys are expecting NII to be stable sequentially. And I just wondering if you can help us flush out like what parts of the loan book are you still expecting to see come down? And how are is that being offset with other parts of the kind of earning asset statement in terms of being able to keep the NII stable? Thanks.\nWilliam Demchak: Rob?\nRobert Reilly: Yes hey Ken, good morning. Yes so when we take a look at the NII stable there is obviously the earning asset side and the liability side. I think we've made a lot of - we've made up a lot of ground on the liability side. I think we can still do some more there. When we look at the fourth quarter in terms of loan balances, commercial we see, we still be seeing relatively flattish. And again, this all depends on what happens. And consumer, we could see some uptick there particularly if there is some stimulus. I think the other factor for us and for the industry in terms of the fourth quarter will be the rate at which PPP loans are forgiven. We have an expectation built into our guidance that about half of those - half of what we have will be forgiven, and that's built into our guidance in the fourth quarter and then the other half in the first quarter of 2021. So that's probably the biggest play in terms of how NII and total loans drop.\nWilliam Demchak: Funding costs.\nRobert Reilly: I said that, yes, I said that on the front end yes got it.\nKen Usdin: And my follow-up actually Rob is on that PPP front.\nRobert Reilly: Yes.\nKen Usdin: The C&I loan yields were actually stable, down 1 basis point. I was wondering if you can help us understand the contribution from PPP related interest income this quarter versus last? And again, how that plays through in terms of the yields and the forgiveness in fees and all that it gets really tricky, right? Thanks.\nRobert Reilly: It does get a little tricky. I'd say a good number for us in terms of our guidance would be about $100 million in NII related to PPP forgiveness in the fourth quarter. So that will help you size it.\nWilliam Demchak: But straight C&I loan spread, I think we're up 7.\nRobert Reilly: Spreads up - yields are down.\nWilliam Demchak: Still growing down as we roll down in the lower LIBOR\u2019s.\nRobert Reilly: Yes that's right. So about $100 million Ken on that - on the PPP.\nKen Usdin: Do you have just what that was in the third quarter versus the 100?\nRobert Reilly: Yes, it was very - much smaller.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nErika Najarian: Another firm that is going through this downturn solidly JPMorgan, was essentially chomping at the bit in terms of appetite for buybacks once to Fed lifts its restrictions. And Bill, I'm wondering, given the amount of excess capital you're sitting on, if the Fed does lift it is restrictions by the first quarter or second quarter of next year? How patient are you going to be in terms of thinking about your inorganic opportunities versus buying back your stock here, at a narrower premium to tangible book than the stock usually enjoys?\nWilliam Demchak: So you should assume that we would otherwise be in the market, but you should also assume that we'll be patient in looking at acquisitions through time. The environment notwithstanding COVID, the environment for banks is going to be tough going forward for all the obvious reasons. So, we continue to think that there's going to be a lot of opportunities out there, the other thing with respect to buybacks. I mean the only thing, I think you ever know for certain is trying to spend as much capital as we have all in a big hurry almost never works out, and makes sense. So, we'll be in the market to a certain degree, but not enough that it changes our focus on the opportunities that we see and debt and expansion through acquisition.\nErika Najarian: Got it.\nRobert Reilly: And - it's quite conceivable we do both.\nWilliam Demchak: Yes.\nErika Najarian: Yes got it.\nWilliam Demchak: In fact falling back.\nErika Najarian: And as a follow-up question. This management team has always been ahead in terms of warning us about the excesses that we're building up in the system pre-COVID. And I'm wondering as we think about the charge-offs that were coming as a follow-up to John's question, do you think that the current programs from the government and the Fed have effectively redefined cumulative credit losses lower for this cycle or are we just kicking the realization down the road?\nWilliam Demchak: Look, they've definitely helped, but with PPP effectively running out and with CARES Act having run out we're going to see an acceleration. We did a survey into small business and smaller commercial, and I think 60% of the respondents if I'm remembering this right, basically said if this continues for another year they'll be out of business.\nRobert Reilly: Alarming high.\nWilliam Demchak: Yes, an incredible percentage. And a lot of those guys have gotten by either through PPP or simply drawing on reserves and operating at it on sustainable level and some things got to give. My guess is, and that's why we kind of talk about charge-offs ramping up as we get into kind of the mid-back half of next year my guess is, it's still - there's going to be a lot that's going to show up.\nErika Najarian: Got it. Thank you.\nRobert Reilly: And future fiscal support is a big variable.\nWilliam Demchak: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please proceed.\nGerard Cassidy: Bill, can you give us some thoughts, obviously you guys pointed out that you've had $60 billion up at the Federal Reserve, and clearly that's weighing on your net interest margin like your peers, because of the influx in deposits. Can you kind of give us some color if that level, if your customers just don't start using their deposits, and it's now heading into the second quarter of next year. Is there anything you can do to shift that money out of there to get a higher yield without taking too much interest rate risk?\nWilliam Demchak: There actually 70 billion there, I think on a spot basis.\nGerard Cassidy: Okay.\nWilliam Demchak: Yes. No, look, you're seeing it, not just on the deposit side, but our utilization rate on credits down 1.6%, I think from the pre-COVID levels. The economy just isn't running, right. So corporates are using less on their lines. They're carrying less inventory. They're doing less investment. They are holding more cash. And I don't know that necessarily abates particularly with the size of the Fed's balance sheet looking like it's going to remain at least stable. In terms of redeployment it's to hard to define something that you see in size that offers a good risk return. We're doing a lot of things at the margin both on the lending side, and some of the specialty finance areas and even on the security side that offer a lot of value, but they're not enough to dent that amount of\u2026\nRobert Reilly: Substantially faster\u2026\nWilliam Demchak: Yes. And trying to force that outcome, so right we could just go out and buy $70 billion worth of 10 years at 70 basis points, and make a lot of money for some short period of time, It's just a - it's a lousy risk return trade off. So, we'll be opportunistic, but my best guess is we are going to be sitting on a lot of cash for a pretty long period of time as will the whole banking industry.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then moving over to the credit. Obviously, you guys have been through cycles before is there - aside from what has caused this down cycle, we all know is quite unique. When you look at the commercial credits that you've been forced to write-down, or the commercial real estate that you've forced to write down, is there been many different, or any differences between what you saw in the last cycle or the 1990s cycle in terms of write-downs that's, it has surprised you, or is it just very similar to the past downturns?\nWilliam Demchak: No, it's, I mean you go all the way back. Most real estate problems historically came from projects. So office buildings that were built, that were never occupied. So you can remember Boston when you could see straight through Downtown because nobody was in. That's where the big losses historically have come from. This is an instance where real estate is struggling, even though in theory, everything is leased up, right. But you have, if you think about retail nobody is paying rent, right. So malls are getting killed, and they were already on a decline.\nRobert Reilly: Hotels.\nWilliam Demchak: Hotels are obvious. A lot of things that, on a normal downturn would have probably still cash flowed and been fine are struggling from a cash flow basis. Interestingly in this one versus the other ones that the loan to values for the asset is notwithstanding the lack of cash flow, still look pretty good. Yes. So this is real estates come up with yet another way, I heard the industry again.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\nBill Carcache: Bill, you said in response to John Pancari's earlier question that the consumer number will depend on whether there is more fiscal stimulus. Would you expect stimulus to be less beneficial on the commercial side?\nWilliam Demchak: It's a fair question. It depends if they redo PPP in some form, that obviously helps out thousands and thousands and thousands of smaller business commercial borrowers, and kept people employed. The consumer side one of the things we've watched and talked about before is that the extra $600 that came in from the CARES Act for unemployment benefits allowed consumers to substantially build cash balances and pay down debt. Now that has gone away, you're basically seeing the balance excess they had in their DDA accounts decline which is why I'm worried about consumers. But, no look if they did - if they redid PPP it would substantially affect the amount of small business commercial charge-offs we've had. Small business, you guys already know this, the small business commercial people who have less access to other forms of capital, are really getting hurt in this environment.\nBill Carcache: I guess following up on your CRE comments, it seems like there may be greater willingness among banks to work with borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. But maybe there is a bit less patients for example with some say CMBS conduit setup by private equity companies, and then that raises the question of whether the likelihood of foreclosures higher outside of the banking system? Do you think that's the case and if so, do you think it could result in growing pressure on commercial real estate prices? And then maybe sort of just to cap off like how can you share your thoughts on how an effective vaccine by say mid 2021 would impact your view of the ultimate loss content within CRE? There's a lot there, just what your thoughts are dependent on?\nWilliam Demchak: So at the margin, banks have always been more willing to work with borrowers then a contractual CMBS relationship where the Midland where as a fiduciary working on behalf of the various credit tranches. Having said that, we've actually been surprised by the turnover that we've seen in our special servicing portfolio in Midland so, we have actually seen a couple things. One, the BP's buyer is being willing to work with borrowers probably in a way they haven\u2019t in past environments. And two to the extent that they say no, take the asset. There is a lot of capital on the sidelines from traditional BP's buyers, who are effectively writing it off in one fund and rebuying it another one. So the turnover has been pretty high. There a bit to my surprise, there is a pretty active secondary market for real estate properties at the moment, probably doesn't carry through to all types. I imagine there is not a good bid for strip halls, but for other types of properties there is.\nRobert Reilly: Well to your point, the nature of this pandemic crisis and these loan to values.\nWilliam Demchak: Yes,\nRobert Reilly: Sort of support that.\nWilliam Demchak: Yes. The COVID vaccine - it has zero predictions, assumptions on when if, how and whether it works and all the above. So I'll just pass on that.\nRobert Reilly: Yes, we know what you know on that.\nBill Carcache: Yes that's fair. If I can squeeze in one last one. Bill, can you share your thoughts around the direct Neobanks, sort of the chimes and others out there that operate exclusively online without traditional branch networks in this sort of post-COVID environment? How you see their presence impacting the competitive environment overseeing the next three to five years? And is there any potential benefit to deploying some of the BlackRock proceeds on Neobank, where are those sort of capabilities, things that you think you can build on your own?\nWilliam Demchak: I'm trying to contain myself. I wish we had the opportunity to basically not have to make any money and grow customers by giving stuff away and running our back office on a third-party bank system, that's written in cobalt from 50 years ago, but we don't have that luxury. Yes, the tech capability of these guys, there is nothing that they have that we don't have nothing that they have, that we can't produce, if we wanted to have. Our platforms are much more modern than their platforms. They're all running on third-party banks, which is a whole another issue that drives me insane. And they basically do free accounts and no overdraft and simple simplification they find very low balance customers, and I just don't think long-term that model works. I think that the delivery, multiple delivery channel model that includes real care centers and customer service, and we see that through our NPS scores through ATM delivery networks, through branch delivery networks and through top-line digital is going to win.\nRobert Reilly: Is our technology.\nWilliam Demchak: Yes and without that, look it's kind of cool, and they're growing lots of customers. But like a lot of things, they're are not making money at it. And banking is a business that you ultimately need to make money at. Sorry there's my rent.\nBill Carcache: That's great.\nRobert Reilly: It's a good question, good question.\nBill Carcache: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nMike Mayo: So, Bill you certainly have been ahead in expressing concern about the way this COVID situation plays out. How do you feel just in the last three months on the one hand you do see the fixed income market securities, which have come in, and I know you know that market? You have low line utilizations which means probably that firms aren't quite ready to go bankrupt. You see your charge-off rate being exceptionally low? On the other hand, who knows if we have the second wave if it\u2019s a W or how that plays out. So just what's your temperature on the outlook over the next couple of years? And do you have seller\u2019s remorse for selling BlackRock, or do you say, you know what, I feel even better today?\nWilliam Demchak: So a couple of things going into this, we look at the corporate side, notwithstanding utilization being down. Corporate Americas levered four times today. We went into the crisis levered three times, which we all thought was high. None of that has changed. The one thing that gives me a little bit of comfort certainly relative to my initial concerns on this environment, as I think we've defined the downside, Mike. So when we went into this, we really had no idea of what in fact the downside could be. We didn't know mortality rates. There were no real treatments for COVID. There was no vaccine. So all of the things we didn't know how to define the downside. So I think the best thing I can tell you is, I think we've defined the downside is that we at this point muddle along pretty much where we are in the economy. And I think that plays out through time, and I think losses grind out through time. As we said, we think at this point we're reserved for that environment. Do I have seller\u2019s remorse? I don't, and not surprisingly, I've gotten that question. I think there is a lot of things I've regret in life with hindsight, and all else equal, I wish we were selling BlackRock today at 650 bucks as opposed to when we sold them at the start of this thing. But I think with the information we have in our hands, it was the right decision. I hope that people and I know a number of our shareholders who bought BlackRock when we sold it, I hope you bought it, and rode that stock up, that was always your choice. We were always going to be left with this basic notion that eventually we were going to have a tax burden that looks like it's going to come to fruition. Eventually, we were going to have regulatory pressure, eventually and not eventually we already had a concentrated asset that was outside of our control. And I'd much rather deploy that capital into something that is within our control. So, I wouldn't change the decision based on what we know at the time and what our strategic direction is, and what I think the opportunity set is going forward. I still remain, I'm trying to find the right word here, but confident that having capital in this coming environment is going to be incredibly valuable and open up a lot of inorganic opportunities for us.\nRobert Reilly: Which is that to your point is, there is a lot of the game left to play.\nWilliam Demchak: Yes. Anybody who thought we'd have the S&P where it is today, when we sold BlackRock give me a call because I'll invest some money with you. I just - that was, if I made a mistake and I've made many in my life, that was probably my one mistake.\nBryan Gill: Do you have any other questions?\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time.\nWilliam Demchak: All right well, thank you everybody. We'll see you again in the fourth quarter.\nRobert Reilly: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your line. Have a great day, everyone.",

            "name": "William Demchak",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and good morning everybody. Hope everybody is safe and well. You've seen that amidst continued uncertainty on many fronts, PNC delivered solid third quarter results. We grew revenue led by noninterest income, which included a bounce back in consumer fees on higher volumes. We managed expenses which allowed us to generate positive operating leverage of over 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date period. And our provision for credit losses was substantially less than last quarter. On the flip side, net interest income fell from the second quarter given the low interest rate environment and weak loan demand. Despite growth in customers and commitments our loans outstanding declined due to lower utilization rates, including the pay-off of commercial lines of credit that were drawn early in the pandemic. And while we continue to experience strong deposit growth, the current environment has made it more challenging to put those deposits to work. While the provision and charge-offs were down quarter-on-quarter, non-performers continue to rise, especially in a high impact COVID areas that Rob is going to discuss in a little bit more detail. Notwithstanding these challenges, we feel that PNC is well positioned with very strong capital, liquidity and loan loss reserves. Needless to say there are several significant upcoming events including the next round of stress tests, the election, and PPP forgiveness that may impact the industry and our borrowers, which underscores the importance of our strong position. We're confident that the actions we've taken position us to both support our clients and communities and take advantage of potential investment opportunities if they arise to enhance shareholder value. I want to thank our employees who despite the various challenges of the pandemic continue to execute on our strategic priorities including ongoing investments in our national expansion and digital offerings, all while helping our customers navigate financial hardship, and other challenges. During the quarter we opened retail solution centers in Nashville, Houston, Denver, Boston and Dallas and filled out corporate teams in the recently opened Seattle and Portland markets. In 2021 we will continue our middle market expansion into San Antonio, Austin and San Diego. The ability to expose our model to these demographically attractive markets continues to generate strong returns. And with that I'm going to turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our third quarter results, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. There is a lot of variables that kind of go into that answer, John. But remember again, when we put up the second quarter reserve the assumption based on our economic forecast in the model. So that was, that we covered all of the losses we knew about at that point in time. At the margin, the economy has gotten perhaps a little bit better on the forecast. And so, we're kind of as charge-offs go up. We're using and effective reserves that we provided for in the second quarter. So that all else equal, should continue unless we have deterioration from our current forecast and what the economy is doing. But the general principle is all else equal as loans run down and charge-offs go through, that's what we've reserved for. Again, it depends on a lot of things, not the least of which is what fiscal stimulus they put out there, if any. But all else equal, it probably start showing up in the second half of next year. My own belief is, we're probably going to see more pressure on COVID sensitive industries, real estate earlier on, and then consumers flow through as we get into the back half of next year. But it all depends, where the consumer number in my view is going to be highly dependent on whether they provide more fiscal stimulus, which I think they absolutely need to do. Look, you're making a whole bunch of assumptions in there. The regulation as I understand it as it's written in the laws. I understand its written is basically to the extent that we were to do deal and not cause a systemic risk to the economy. Ultimately, it has to go through approval process to be approved. They can delay it, they can hold hearings they can do all sorts of different things. But basically it gets approved. So even in a change in administration the assumption that somehow they either change laws on this particular issue, even if they switch governors that the regulatory process is still the same. So I don't know that that's a real risk. I would say that as we've always said that the smaller deals aren't off the table, but they require a fair amount of work for less total return, in effect. Can we do a bunch of them? Yes, we could do a bunch of them over time. Yes. Rob? Funding costs. But straight C&I loan spread, I think we're up 7. Still growing down as we roll down in the lower LIBOR's. So you should assume that we would otherwise be in the market, but you should also assume that we'll be patient in looking at acquisitions through time. The environment notwithstanding COVID, the environment for banks is going to be tough going forward for all the obvious reasons. So, we continue to think that there's going to be a lot of opportunities out there, the other thing with respect to buybacks. I mean the only thing, I think you ever know for certain is trying to spend as much capital as we have all in a big hurry almost never works out, and makes sense. So, we'll be in the market to a certain degree, but not enough that it changes our focus on the opportunities that we see and debt and expansion through acquisition. Yes. In fact falling back. Look, they've definitely helped, but with PPP effectively running out and with CARES Act having run out we're going to see an acceleration. We did a survey into small business and smaller commercial, and I think 60% of the respondents if I'm remembering this right, basically said if this continues for another year they'll be out of business. Yes, an incredible percentage. And a lot of those guys have gotten by either through PPP or simply drawing on reserves and operating at it on sustainable level and some things got to give. My guess is, and that's why we kind of talk about charge-offs ramping up as we get into kind of the mid-back half of next year my guess is, it's still - there's going to be a lot that's going to show up. Yes. There actually 70 billion there, I think on a spot basis. Yes. No, look, you're seeing it, not just on the deposit side, but our utilization rate on credits down 1.6%, I think from the pre-COVID levels. The economy just isn't running, right. So corporates are using less on their lines. They're carrying less inventory. They're doing less investment. They are holding more cash. And I don't know that necessarily abates particularly with the size of the Fed's balance sheet looking like it's going to remain at least stable. In terms of redeployment it's to hard to define something that you see in size that offers a good risk return. We're doing a lot of things at the margin both on the lending side, and some of the specialty finance areas and even on the security side that offer a lot of value, but they're not enough to dent that amount of... Yes. And trying to force that outcome, so right we could just go out and buy $70 billion worth of 10 years at 70 basis points, and make a lot of money for some short period of time, It's just a - it's a lousy risk return trade off. So, we'll be opportunistic, but my best guess is we are going to be sitting on a lot of cash for a pretty long period of time as will the whole banking industry. No, it's, I mean you go all the way back. Most real estate problems historically came from projects. So office buildings that were built, that were never occupied. So you can remember Boston when you could see straight through Downtown because nobody was in. That's where the big losses historically have come from. This is an instance where real estate is struggling, even though in theory, everything is leased up, right. But you have, if you think about retail nobody is paying rent, right. So malls are getting killed, and they were already on a decline. Hotels are obvious. A lot of things that, on a normal downturn would have probably still cash flowed and been fine are struggling from a cash flow basis. Interestingly in this one versus the other ones that the loan to values for the asset is notwithstanding the lack of cash flow, still look pretty good. Yes. So this is real estates come up with yet another way, I heard the industry again. It's a fair question. It depends if they redo PPP in some form, that obviously helps out thousands and thousands and thousands of smaller business commercial borrowers, and kept people employed. The consumer side one of the things we've watched and talked about before is that the extra $600 that came in from the CARES Act for unemployment benefits allowed consumers to substantially build cash balances and pay down debt. Now that has gone away, you're basically seeing the balance excess they had in their DDA accounts decline which is why I'm worried about consumers. But, no look if they did - if they redid PPP it would substantially affect the amount of small business commercial charge-offs we've had. Small business, you guys already know this, the small business commercial people who have less access to other forms of capital, are really getting hurt in this environment. So at the margin, banks have always been more willing to work with borrowers then a contractual CMBS relationship where the Midland where as a fiduciary working on behalf of the various credit tranches. Having said that, we've actually been surprised by the turnover that we've seen in our special servicing portfolio in Midland so, we have actually seen a couple things.

            "name": "Robert Reilly",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Bill and good morning everyone. As you've seen, we've reported third quarter net income of $1.5 billion or $3.39 per diluted common share. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4, and is presented on an average basis. On the asset side total loans declined $15 billion to $253 billion linked quarter. Investment securities of $91 billion increased $2 billion or 2% linked quarter. But on a spot basis declined $7 billion, primarily due to significant prepayment activity and maturities at quarter-end. Our cash balances at the Federal Reserve to average $60 billion compared with $34 billion in the second quarter. The increase was a result of continued deposit growth and the full quarter impact of proceeds from the sale of our equity investment in BlackRock. On the liability side deposit balances averaged $350 billion, and were up $15 billion or 5% linked quarter. Borrowed funds decreased $10 billion compared to the second quarter as we used our strong liquidity position to reduce borrowings primarily with the Federal Home Loan Bank. And our tangible book value was $95.71 per common share as of September 30, an increase of 2% linked quarter and 16% year-over-year. As you can see on Slide 5, our capital reserve and liquidity positions remain strong. As of September 30, 2020 our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 11.7%. Our Board recently approved a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.15 per share. And as you know the Fed has authorized dividends for the fourth quarter, again subject to amounts not exceeding the average of net income for the preceding four quarters. On this basis, our fourth quarter dividend is 26% of that rolling number. In regard to share repurchases and in accordance with the Federal Reserve's directive, we'll continue to suspend repurchases through the fourth quarter of 2020. Our loan loss reserve levels are 2.58%, up slightly from 2.55% at the end of June. And our liquidity coverage ratios continue to significantly exceed the regulatory minimum requirements as we remain core-funded with a low cost deposit base. Slide 6 shows our average loans and deposits in more detail. Average loan balances of $253 billion in the third quarter were down $15 billion or 6% compared to the second quarter. This decline reflected a $13.7 billion decrease in commercial loan balances as new loan production was more than offset by broad-based lower utilization. In our C&IB segment virtually all of the draw-downs that occurred in the first quarter, has since paid back and our utilization rates are currently running approximately 1% below pre-pandemic levels. Consumer loans declined approximately $1.3 billion across all categories except for residential mortgage which increased. Compared to the same period a year ago average loans grew 6% or $15 billion. As the Slide shows the yield on our loan balances is 3.32%, a 5 basis point decline in the second quarter and the rate paid on our interest bearing deposits was 12 basis points and 11 basis point decline linked quarter. Average deposit balances of $350 billion increased $15 billion or 5%. Commercial deposits grew reflecting the enhanced liquidity positions of our customers, and consumer deposits also grew primarily due to government stimulus and lower consumer spending. Year-over-year deposits increased $71 billion or 26%. As you can see on Slide 7, third quarter total revenue was $4.3 billion up $205 million linked quarter or 5%. Net interest income of $2.5 billion was down $43 million or 2% compared to the second quarter as lower earning asset yields and a decline in loan balances more than offset the benefit of lower funding costs and an extra day in the quarter. Our net interest margin decreased to 2.39%, down 13 basis points linked quarter, reflecting the impact of higher balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank, which average $60 billion for the quarter. Fed cash balances in excess of our LCR requirements were approximately $40 billion, which represented 25 basis points of compression to our net interest margin. Noninterest income of $1.8 billion increased $248 million or 16% linked quarter. Fee revenue of $1.3 billion increased $62 million or 5% compared to the second quarter. Asset management revenue increased $16 million or 8% primarily due to higher average equity markets. Consumer services and services charges on deposits in total increased by a $100 million due to higher consumer activity and a decrease in fee waivers. Corporate services declined $33 million or 6% as higher treasury management product revenue was more than offset by lower advisory related fees. Residential mortgage revenue declined $21 million or 13% driven by both lower servicing fees and lower loan sales revenue. Other noninterest income of $457 million increased $186 million and included a positive valuation adjustment of private equity investments, compared with a negative valuation adjustment in the second quarter of a similar magnitude. The positive valuation adjustment was partially offset by lower capital markets related revenue. Noninterest expense increased $16 million or less than 1% compared to the second quarter. Provision for credit losses was $52 million, a decrease of $2.4 billion as a provision expense for our commercial portfolio was largely offset by a provision recapture in our consumer portfolio. And our effective tax rate was 9.8%. The lower rate was primarily related to increased tax credit - during tax credits during the quarter. For the fourth quarter we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 13%. Turning to Slide 8. During the third quarter, we generated positive operating leverage of 4% in both the year-over-year quarter and the year-to-date comparisons. As a result, our efficiency ratio improved to 59% in the third quarter of 2020 compared to 62% for both the prior year third quarter and the nine months ended September 30th, 2019. While the current environment presents revenue challenges from low rates and pandemic related pressures, we remain deliberate and disciplined around our expense management. As we previously stated, we have a goal to reduce cost by $300 million in 2020 through our continuous improvement program, and we are confident we will achieve our full year target. As you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments. Slide 9, is an update regarding specific industries we've identified as most likely to be impacted by the effects of the pandemic. Our outstanding loan balances as of September 30 to these industries were $18.3 billion or $16.4 billion, excluding PPP loans. These balances declined 7% compared to the second quarter, primarily due to pay-downs. While we still have an experienced material charge-offs in these industries we do expect to see charge-offs increase over time should current economic trends continue. Commercial and industrial loan balances in this category, totaled $10.5 billion on September 30th declining approximately $1 billion or 9% compared to the prior quarter. Nonperforming loans in these industries remain relatively low at 1% of loans outstanding, but we're continuing to see downgrades with the greatest stress continuing to be in leisure and recreation. Looking at the lower half of the slide commercial real estate loans in this category totaled $7.8 billion at the end of the third quarter, declining $300 million or 4% compared to the prior quarter. Nonperforming loans increased approximately $180 million and downgrades continue to occur primarily in retail and lodging. Correspondingly, our reserves on our total commercial real estate portfolio have increased to 2.17% from 1.33% in the second quarter. Moving to Slide 10. We have seen a significant reduction in the number of consumers, and small businesses requesting hardship assistance. At the peak this summer we have granted modifications to more than 300,000 consumer and small business accounts representing approximately $13.7 billion of loans. $6.9 billion of these loans were government guaranteed or investor-owned which present very little credit risk to PNC. Of the remaining $6.8 billion of loans that did present credit risk, more than $5 billion have rolled off payment assistance and 92% of those accounts are current or less than 30 days past due. As a result, we had $1.7 billion of consumer and small business balances in some form of payment assistance as of September 30th. Of those balances approximately 85% are secured, and more than 60% of these accounts have made a payment in their last cycle. On the commercial side, we're also continuing to selectively grant loan modifications based on each individual borrowers situation. Within our C&IB segment approximately $700 million of loan balances were in deferral as of September 30th. When combining consumer and commercial customers, loans on deferral posing credit risk to PNC approximate 1% of total loan outstandings. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 11. Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $155 million, down $81 million from the second quarter. Commercial net charge-offs were $38 million and consumer net charge-offs were $117 million, both down linked quarter. Annualized net charge-offs to total loans was 24 basis points. Total delinquencies of $1.2 billion at September 30th declined $72 million, or 5%. Consumer loan delinquencies decreased $41 million and commercial loan delinquencies declined $31 million. Nonperforming loans increased $209 million, or 11% compared to June 30. The increase was primarily driven by commercial real estate borrowers in the high impact COVID 19 industries. As you can see the allowance for credit losses to loans was 2.58% at quarter end, up slightly from last quarter. We believe that our reserves sufficiently reflect the life of loan losses in the current portfolio. Slide 12 highlights the components of the change in our allowance for credit losses year-to-date, which have increased $3.4 billion since December 31st, 2019. As a result our allowance for credit losses to total loans was 2.58% and our allowance to nonperforming loans was 276%. Our reserves have increased materially this year due to the adoption of CECL, and significant changes in the macroeconomic outlook during the first half of the year. In the third quarter portfolio changes primarily driven by lower loan balances reduced reserves by $158 million. In addition, our economic outlook improved modestly during the quarter, but this was offset by increased reserves for both commercial and consumer borrowers adversely impacted by the pandemic. In total, this resulted in a $150 million decline in our reserves to $6.4 billion. In summary PNC posted solid third quarter results. And we believe our balance sheet is well positioned for this challenging environment. For the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter of 2020, we expect average loans to decline low single digits. We expect net interest income to be stable. We expect core fee income to be stable. We expect other noninterest income to be between $275 million and $325 million, resulting in our expectation that total noninterest income will be down in the high single-digit range. We expect total noninterest expense to be up approximately 1%, and in regard to net charge-offs, we expect fourth quarter levels to be between $200 million and $250 million. Importantly, after taking all this into account, we're on pace to deliver positive operating leverage between 3% and 4% for the full year of 2020. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions. Yes, that's right. John, I would just add it on that. I think it's all speculation at this point, but mid 2021, feels right. There is a lot of things to play out. I'd say, John, a lot of things to play out, and our thinking generally hasn't changed. Yes hey Ken, good morning. Yes so when we take a look at the NII stable there is obviously the earning asset side and the liability side. I think we've made a lot of - we've made up a lot of ground on the liability side. I think we can still do some more there. When we look at the fourth quarter in terms of loan balances, commercial we see, we still be seeing relatively flattish. And again, this all depends on what happens. And consumer, we could see some uptick there particularly if there is some stimulus. I think the other factor for us and for the industry in terms of the fourth quarter will be the rate at which PPP loans are forgiven. We have an expectation built into our guidance that about half of those - half of what we have will be forgiven, and that's built into our guidance in the fourth quarter and then the other half in the first quarter of 2021. So that's probably the biggest play in terms of how NII and total loans drop. I said that, yes, I said that on the front end yes got it. Yes. It does get a little tricky. I'd say a good number for us in terms of our guidance would be about $100 million in NII related to PPP forgiveness in the fourth quarter. So that will help you size it. Spreads up - yields are down. Yes that's right. So about $100 million Ken on that - on the PPP. Yes, it was very - much smaller. And - it's quite conceivable we do both. Alarming high. And future fiscal support is a big variable. Substantially faster... Hotels. Well to your point, the nature of this pandemic crisis and these loan to values. Sort of support that. Yes, we know what you know on that. Is our technology. It's a good question, good question. Which is that to your point is, there is a lot of the game left to play. Yes. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PNC Financial Services Group Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bryan Gill. Sir, please go ahead.\nBryan Gill: Hello, thank you Carlos and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today\u2019s earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These materials are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of July 15, 2020 and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill.\nWilliam S. Demchak: Thanks Bryan and good morning everybody. As you have seen this morning our results for the second quarter had a number of moving parts including obviously the gain on the sale of our stake in BlackRock. Now overall I thought it was a pretty solid quarter in the context of the environment that we are operating in. You would have seen that revenue was down from the first quarter, which, if you remember, included some kind of one off gains and expenses were well managed. We were able to produce positive operating leverage both in Q2 and for the first half of the year. However, as we mentioned in our first quarter call our view of the economy has substantially worsened since we closed the books three months ago and in turn has resulted in a substantial loan loss reserve bill. Our recent CCAR results should lay to rest any concern that this is a PNC specific balance sheet problem. The CCAR results underscore the strength of our balance sheet, which, coupled with the benefits of the monetization of our BlackRock investment position PNC with substantial capital and liquidity to continue to support our constituents and capitalize on opportunities that can arise during disruptive markets. In fact, our capital ratios are at record levels and we saw a significant increase in our book value. Looking ahead, I fully recognize that we are perhaps a bit more pessimistic than the market on the odds of a full recovery anytime soon. While recent economic data has been encouraging, we're still in the very early innings of how this is going to play out. Massive fiscal and monetary stimulus has allowed us to, in fact, kick the can down the road in terms of feeling the real effects of this recession. Much is going to depend on continuing support from the government as the economy continues to adjust with life with COVID. Unfortunately, what is becoming very clear, at least to me, is that there is a new normal that will have profound and lasting effects on parts of our economy and the workforce that supports it. Despite these challenging times in which you are navigating simultaneous crisis, both the pandemic and civil unrest caused by deep racial inequalities. PNC has remained steadfast in our commitment to our customers, communities, employees and shareholders. Despite the challenges of COVID we continue to make good progress in terms of executing on our key strategic focus areas, including national middle market expansion and our national digital efforts. Now, before I turn it over to Rob, I want to recognize and thank our employees who are going above and beyond to help our customers address the many challenges that they are facing. I also want to thank my leadership team including Carole Brown and Richard Bynum, the newest members of our executive committee, for their invaluable support during this time. And finally, I want to thank our Board of Directors for their leadership as we continue to navigate what has been a year of both extraordinary challenges and opportunities. Now I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our second quarter results and then we'll be happy to take your questions.\nRobert Q. Reilly: Thanks, Bill. And good morning, everyone. As Bill just mentioned and notable during the second quarter, we divested our equity investment in BlackRock, which generated $14.2 billion in net proceeds with an after tax gain of $4.3 billion. PNC\u2019s portion of BlackRock results both second quarter activity and prior periods are now reported as discontinued operations. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. On the asset side total loans grew $24.5 billion to $268 billion linked quarter. Our investment securities of $88 billion increased $4 billion or 5%. Our cash balances at the Federal Reserve averaged $34 billion and were $50 billion at the end of the quarter. The significant increase was a result of liquidity from the sale of our investment in BlackRock and strong deposit growth. On the liability side, deposit balances averaged $335 billion for the quarter and were up $45 billion or 16% linked quarter. Total borrowed funds decreased $4 billion compared to the first quarter. Importantly, on a spot basis borrowed funds declined approximately $26 billion as we used excess liquidity to reduce borrowings, primarily with the Federal Home Loan Bank. And our tangible book value was $93.54 per common share as of June 30th, an increase of 10% linked quarter and 16% year-over-year. As you can see on Slide 5, our capital reserve and liquidity positions are all strong. As of June 30, 2020, our Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated to be 11.3%. Our Board recently approved a quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share, which is consistent with the previous quarter. As you know, the Fed has authorized dividends for the third quarter subject to amounts not exceeding the average of net income for the preceding four quarters. On this basis our third quarter dividend is 27% of our average net income for the prior four quarters. In regard to share repurchases and in accordance with the Federal Reserve's guidance, we'll continue to suspend share repurchases through the third quarter, with the exception of permissible employee benefit related purchases. Our loan loss reserve levels have increased substantially in light of the current economic conditions and are now at 2.55%. We remain core funded with a low cost deposit base and importantly, our liquidity coverage ratios significantly exceed the regulatory minimum requirements. Slide 6 shows our average loans and deposits in more detail. Average loan balances of $268 billion in the second quarter were up $25 billion or 10% compared to the first quarter. This growth reflected an increase in commercial loan balances of approximately $25 billion, driven by higher utilization related to line draws, short-term liquidity facilities to support our clients, and new loan balances under the paycheck protection program. Consumer loans declined approximately $700 million, reflecting lower activity in card, auto, and student loans. It's worth noting that spot loans declined $6.4 billion, predominantly related to lower commercial loan utilization. Our C&IB segment experienced a 5.5% decline in utilization rates from peak levels, as approximately 75% of the lines that were drawn were subsequently paid down. At quarter end, utilization rates were approximately 1% above pre-COVID rates. Compared to the same period a year ago average loans grew 14% or $33 billion. As the slide shows the yield on our loan balances declined 71 basis points to 3.37% in the second quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of the Fed's 150 basis point reduction in interest rates during the first quarter, which drove LIBOR rates lower as well. The rate paid on our deposits also declined 47 basis points linked quarter to 23 basis points. Average deposit balances of $335 billion increased $45 billion or 16% linked quarter. Commercial deposits grew reflecting the enhanced liquidity positions of our customers due to COVID-19 concerns. Consumer deposits also grew primarily due to government stimulus payments and lower consumer spending. Year-over-year deposits increased $62 billion or 23%. As you can see on Slide 7 second quarter total revenue was $4.1 billion, down $260 million linked quarter or 6%. Net interest income of $2.5 billion was up $16 million or 1% compared to the first quarter as higher earning asset balances and lower funding costs offset lower yields. Our net interest margin decreased to 2.52%, down 32 basis points linked quarter reflecting the full quarter impact of the 150 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate during March 2020 and the related decline in other market rates. Non-interest income of $1.6 billion declined $276 million or 15% linked quarter. Fee revenue decreased $204 million or 14%. Consumer services and service charges on deposits declined by $136 million in total due to lower consumer activity and fee waivers in the second quarter. Residential mortgage production volumes and loan sales revenues were both higher but were more than offset by a lower RMSR evaluation. And asset management and corporate services remained relatively stable. Other non-interest income declined $72 million, reflecting lower securities gains partially offset by strong client activity in corporate securities and capital markets. Non-interest expense declined $28 million or 1% compared to the first quarter due to lower business activity, as well as continued progress on our cost savings initiatives related to our continuous improvement program. As Bill mentioned, we generated positive operating leverage for the second quarter, both year-over-year and year-to-date. Provision for credit losses was $2.5 billion, reflecting the worsening of our economic outlook relative to March, which I'll provide more detail on in a moment. And our effective tax rate was 17.5%. Slide 8 is an update to the template we introduced in the first quarter regarding specific industries we've identified as most likely to be impacted by the effects of the pandemic. Our outstanding loan balances as of June 30th to these industries are $19.6 billion and represent approximately 8% of our total loan portfolio. We haven't yet experienced any material charge offs in these industries, however, if current economic trends continue, we'll see charge offs increase over time. Corporate loan balances in these industries totaled $11.5 billion, an increase of approximately $900 million since March 31st resulting from funding of $2 billion of PPP loans. Excluding the PPP loans balances are down approximately 10%. Non-performing loans in these industries were flat linked quarter at just under 1% of loan outstanding but criticized assets did grow during the quarter with the greatest stress seen in leisure, recreation, and travel. We have 8.1 billion in loans to high impact industries and our commercial real estate portfolio, a decrease of approximately $600 million since the end of March. Non-performing loans in the real estate categories increased from approximately $5 million at March 31st to just over $140 million, driven almost entirely by a single mall REIT related credit. Similar to last quarter we continued to see substantial stress in the retail and lodging segments. Turning to Slide 9, this is an update on our oil and gas portfolio, which at the end of the second quarter was $4.1 billion, or less than 2% of total outstanding loans. Outstanding loan balances have declined approximately $500 million since March 31, 2020. As expected, we continue to see an increase in the non-performing loans, which now represent approximately 4% of current outstandings in this portfolio. We believe we are properly reserved for this portfolio and we'll continue to monitor market conditions. Turning to Slide 10, we're continuing to provide relief and flexibility to our customers through loan modifications during these uncertain times. With our consumer customers who are granting loan modifications through extensions, deferrals, and forbearance, new requests for modifications have declined 97% from their peak in early April but year-to-date we've granted assistance to nearly 280,000 customer accounts. Representing $12.7 billion of loans, excuse me, 6.6 billion of which is investor owned and 6.1 billion, which is bank owned. Of the 6.1 billion bank owned modification they continue to represent a small percentage of both overall accounts and total loan exposures for each asset class. And a significant percentage of clients have made at least one payment in the last 60 days. Although these payments suggest a potential decrease in modifications as extension periods begin to expire, we believe it's too early to make that conclusion. On the commercial side we're offering emergency relief for small and medium sized businesses, including to the PPP loans. We're also selectively granting loan modifications to commercial clients based on each individual borrower's situation. Our credit quality metrics are presented on Slide 11. Net charge offs for loans and leases where $236 million, a $24 million increase from the first quarter. Annualized net charge offs to total loans remained stable at 35 basis point. Total delinquencies of $1.3 billion at June 30th declined $173 million or 12% reflecting a decline in delinquencies related to the Cares Act as well as other forbearance and extension fees. Non-performing loans increased $232 million or 14%, compared to March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by commercial real estate borrowers and the high impact COVID-19 industries, as well as borrowers in the energy industry, which I previously mentioned. As you can see the allowance for credit losses to loans has increased to 2.55% in the second quarter, compared to 1.66% last quarter, primarily resulting from our updated economic forecasts, which incorporate a significant COVID-19 impact on the economy. Importantly, we believe the economic assumptions used in the scenarios generate our CECL reserve estimates this quarter, sufficiently reflect the life of loan losses in our current portfolio. Therefore, we don't anticipate any substantial reserve bills during the remainder of 2020 based on these assumptions, which I will cover next. The recent CCAR results highlight the quality of PNC\u2019s loan portfolio. Under the severely adverse scenario our cumulative losses as a percentage of our total portfolio were lower than most of our peers. However, based on our economic outlook under the CECL methodology, we did have a substantial increase in our allowance this quarter. Slide 12 highlights the drivers of the increase to our allowance for credit losses. Our attribution shows the increase in reserves of $557 million for portfolio changes and approximately $1.6 billion for economic factors. Our weighted average economic scenario is derived from four separate scenarios and uses a number of economic variables, with the largest drivers being GDP and the unemployment rate. In this scenario, annualized GDP contract 6.2% in the third quarter of 2020, finishing the year down 4.9% from the fourth quarter 2019 levels and recovering to prerecession peak levels by the first quarter of 2022. Additionally, this scenario assumes the quarterly unemployment rate falls to 9.5% in the fourth quarter of this year, from a peak at 13.6% in the second quarter, with the labor market continuing to recover in 2021 and 2022. For internal analytical purposes we also considered hypothetically what our capital ratios would be if we had a year-end 2020 allowance for credit losses equal to the nine quarter Fed CCAR severely adverse scenario losses, a $12.1 billion essentially fund loading an incremental $5.5 billion in reserves over the next two quarters. I want to emphasize this scenario is not our expectation, but simply approximate the possible outcome under a hypothetical severe condition. The analysis resulted in a CET 1 ratio of approximately 10% at December 31, 2020, a level well above 7%, which is our regulatory minimum of 4.5%, plus our stress capital buffer of 2.5%. In summary, from a capital liquidity and loan loss reserve perspective, we believe our balance sheet is well positioned for this challenging environment. Clearly, the biggest variables impacting the economy continue to be the duration of this crisis and the efficacy of the massive U.S. government support and stimulus programs. At this time we have no way of knowing these outcomes and visibility remains low. Within that context, our guidance for the third quarter and our thoughts for the full year are as follows. For the third quarter of 2020, compared to the second quarter of 2020, we expect the average loans to decline in the low single-digit range. We expect net interest income to be down approximately 1%. We expect total non-interest income to be down between 3% and 5%, which includes our expectation that core fee revenue will be stable while other non-interest income will be lower in the quarter. We expect total non-interest expense to be flat to down. And in regard to net charge offs, we expect third quarter levels to be between $250 million and $350 million. For the full year and again I want to emphasize the context and limitation of low visibility, we now expect both revenue and non-interest expense to each be down between 2% and 5% and our effective tax rate is now expected to be in the low teens. And with that Bill and I are ready to take your questions.\nBryan Gill: Carlos, could we please have the first question?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning.\nRobert Q. Reilly: Hey, good morning John.\nJohn Pancari: Just wanted to see if you can talk a little bit about the margin. I know that you expect in your outlook spread revenue to be down about 1% in the third quarter. How do you -- what does that mean in terms of your margin expectations going into the third quarter and then I guess through the back half of the year?\nRobert Q. Reilly: Yeah, hey John its Rob. Good morning. We don't provide NIM guidance so to speak because it's an outcome. But I would say generally speaking I expect margins to remain sort of stable. We will clearly see some lower yields as a function of rate being lower. But we also have some more room on the liability side. I think largely the loss side.\nJohn Pancari: I mean, we also have all the PPP fees.\nRobert Q. Reilly: Yes. Yeah.\nJohn Pancari: I mean, we're likely to see that spike in the fourth quarter on yield?\nRobert Q. Reilly: Yeah, so we might see a little bit of a lift in the fourth quarter, but essentially these are the NIM levels where I think we'll be at some time.\nJohn Pancari: Right, okay, alright that's helpful. And then separately, Bill, I just want to see if you can give us an update on your thoughts around the potential deployment of the BlackRock capital, if your thought process has changed at all since you completed the sale of the stake and if you could just give us how you're thinking about ultimately putting out the work? Thanks.\nWilliam S. Demchak: Yeah, no real changes. We're going to be patient here. You know, I think, like I said in my script, we're in pretty early innings here to see how this all plays out. The fiscal payments that the government's put out plus what the Fed's done is, effectively masked what are some pretty severe underlying problems in the economy. And depending on how fast that comes back and/or if the government keeps providing stimulus, it'll tell us how much of that capital we need in the first place and secondly, what the opportunities will be to deploy it. So we're going to be patient. The strategy of trying to pursue bank like acquisitions to help us expand our national franchise remains the same.\nJohn Pancari: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nScott Siefers: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question.\nWilliam S. Demchak: Hey, good morning.\nScott Siefers: Hey, Rob I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the nuance within the fee income guide for the third quarter, it sounds like the core fees that you guide to are pretty stable, but maybe just sort of the put and takes and then how I guess maybe a retrospective, I guess, on how some of those activity based fees came in relative to what you guys would have thought and how they are coming through the quarter?\nRobert Q. Reilly: Yeah, I think I'll answer it sort of backwards there. I think, in retrospect, I think it largely came in as we expected softer on the consumer side, which we did expect as a function of the lower activity as well as the fee waivers. Corporate services was actually pretty strong, down a little bit. But, some good activity there that might have been a little better than what we expected. And then asset management and mortgage both came in with expectations, asset management relatively flat, mortgage up a bit in terms of production. We had that large RMSR gain in the first quarter so we were down quarter-over-quarter but production levels were outside. I think in retrospect they came in as we expected. Going forward in terms of stable for the third quarter and again, you know Scott, it's fluid so visibility is low. But I'd expect consumer services actually to pick up a little bit, corporate services maybe to fall off a little bit. And asset management and residential mortgage essentially stable. And again that's with the caveat of the environment and how much consumer activity actually happens.\nScott Siefers: Yeah. Okay, perfect, thank you. And then to switch gears on the reserve, this may end up being totally premature, given how fluid the situation is. But if you guys are right in your assumptions and there's no need for additional reserve build, how does provisioning then project like, at what point or how much clarity does one need in a CECL world before like you start drawing down the reserve, how does that kind of stuff work in this newer reserving role?\nRobert Q. Reilly: Well, you know, Bill may want to chime in too, we are -- you're getting ahead of ourselves there a little bit in terms of how we positioned it now. But it's going to be a function of the models, obviously, which we'll continue to run through the balance of the year and next year. And at some point when those just by definition, when those scenarios improve, provided that you didn't need the reserves for charge offs you'd start to release. That\u2019s a CECL definition.\nScott Siefers: Yeah.\nWilliam S. Demchak: I mean, mechanically, if all else holds true on assumptions, you roll down and then burn off the reserve with your charge offs and you add life of the loan reserves for whatever new loans come on and in effect, you'd be adding provision for new loans and everything else would put salt to zero, if everything else held equal which most certainly won't.\nRobert Q. Reilly: Yeah, that's right. And I think the distinction just in terms of the components of the calculation which our portfolio changes, which incorporates the levels of loans and then the economic assumptions.\nScott Siefers: Yeah. Okay, perfect. And if I can sneak just one final one and just so I'm certain I'm on the right page, the BlackRock game, just for the purposes of the dividend, excuse me, the earnings deficiency test that's now part of the CCAR rules there's nothing that like disqualifies that again, right, it\u2026?\nRobert Q. Reilly: Yeah.\nScott Siefers: Okay, wonderful. Perfect. Alright, thank you very much.\nRobert Q. Reilly: Yes, sure.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nErika Najarian: Hi, good morning. My first question is for you, Bill. So one of your peers, Jamie Diamond said something yesterday that really struck me and that he said don't count on buybacks for the fourth quarter and given that we don't have any of the information in terms of capital plans beyond the third quarter, and given that you have a significant amount of capital, even if the severely adverse scenario becomes your base case, I'm wondering what your view is in terms of balancing buyback activity near-term when it's more allowable to do so versus just keeping the powder dry for that opportunity?\nWilliam S. Demchak: First of all, if we get into an environment where somehow buybacks are allowed in the fourth quarter, I'm not sure where he was going with that in terms of maybe he's hearing something from the Fed I'm not. But ignoring that, just assume that there were no restrictions at the moment for the Fed. I continue to believe, that we are going to see opportunities both organic and inorganic in this environment to deploy that capital in a very shareholder friendly way. At the margin, would we use some of our capital to support our share price? Of course we would, but that would be value dependent and it would be also dependent on the environment that we're operating in and whether or not we saw confirmation of our belief that there'll be opportunities or not. So it's we'll see. I mean, you've heard me use the phrase over and over again that will be rational stewards of your capital. And that hasn't changed.\nErika Najarian: Got it and as a follow-up, the one thing that also struck me in the quarter is the amount of cash on your balance sheet. Aside from the BlackRock proceeds, obviously the deposit growth has been significant. And Rob, I'm wondering, as you think about your revenue guide for the rest of the year, what do you assume in terms of the deployment of that cash?\nRobert Q. Reilly: Yeah, hey Erika. So, we will put some of that to work tactically, we won't put all of it to work, obviously. And given particularly in terms of securities yields it's pretty hard to make up a lot of revenue deploying that. So, we're going to run with some pretty high cash balances to the balance of the year. But as far as security side, deployment, loan, loan balances, that's all factored into our guidance.\nErika Najarian: Got it, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKen Usdin: Thanks. Good morning, guys. A big picture question for you, Bill. Just, X the BlackRock sale the business returns to more of a traditional regional banking look in your wheelhouse. And I'm just wondering, as you think about whether it's ROA or ROE potential long term efficiency ratio how do you now just think, if any, differently just about the structure of the company, the business mix, and where you want to head from here long-term?\nWilliam S. Demchak: I don't know that we necessarily think differently about it strategically. We've had a focus and we'll continue our focus through time on organic growth of our consumer lending balances as we simply try to penetrate existing clients. And then to the extent we acquire clients is the same thing. Our business model is basically built on our ability to go to new markets and profitably build share, not just through lending, but through heavy cross-sell and to fund that through our national digital expansion. So, it's less of a focus on do I need to somehow change the mix of what we're doing as opposed to can we accelerate the actual growth of what we're doing in the environment that we're in and coming into. And our belief is that we'll be able to do that. Inside of that, as we look at different opportunities, might things change at the margin. Sure, but it's not by design. It's basically they take what we have and grow it even faster than we have historically.\nKen Usdin: Yeah, and as a follow up to that and then the prior questions, there's the needs versus wants when people think about the potential inorganic strategies, when you think about the franchise and your point earlier about moving towards consumer has been a strategy for a bit. Are there things that you'd just either like to have or think you need to have to still have, like the full complement? Or is it more just going to be about what's opportunistically out there and what's financial as much as it is strategic?\nWilliam S. Demchak: There's nothing in the list that we think we need to have that we don't have. We want to take our existing products and services and go to market strategy and do that in more markets. This issue is something financial versus strategic. The issue of and we'd obviously look at both, the issue of doing a purely financial transaction is one of -- does it cause us to take our eye off the ball in terms of our long-term growth potential, does it mean we wouldn't do it, and what we would do with financial proceeds is accelerate organic growth. But ideally we'd find something that's both very financially attractive and matches our strategic agenda of expanding our geography.\nKen Usdin: Yes, alright, understood. Thanks, Bill.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Sticking somewhat on the theme here of what you'll do with the excess capital, I guess to frame the question and by the way, I agree that we're still early and lots to still play out. But how do you know if the opportunity you're looking for won't be there and then kind of like, what's Plan B, right, like the hope it will be something interesting strategically and financially beneficial and you'll know it when it's there and I think the investors and analysts trust you guys did the right thing there, but if that doesn't arrive, what do you kind of capitulate and say, let's go to Plan B and maybe rates are higher and you can buy some security or you buy back stock, like what's the thought process there?\nWilliam S. Demchak: The thought process is, you know, it sounds a little bit wrong, but to make that decision or worry about that if in fact we get into that environment. At the moment, we're in the middle of an environment where we -- I think Mike Corbett [ph] said this yesterday that there's more we don't know than we do. It is really unclear what the long-term damage is going to be to the economy and how long it's going to take to grow back. And our focus right now is to make sure we have in Jamie's words, a fortress balance sheet that we're serving our customers, that we're opportunistic inside of what is a fairly strange environment at the moment. And we'll sit and watch. And if all of that changes then of course, we'll change and replan and regroup and refocus and so forth. But today, none of that has changed. So we continue to, of course, and I know you guys want to sort of somehow drive us into a corner that says, the following three things happen then are you going to do A, B or C. And my brain can't do that math. So we're not going to go down that path.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Fair enough.\nRobert Q. Reilly: And I would just add to that. We're fairly confident that an opportunity will arise. And if it does we will do it.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: And then maybe in the meantime from an organic perspective, it still seems like there's a couple of areas that you could spend a little bit to try and grow. I mean, I know mortgage has been kind of a frustrating area over the years, but there's been some dislocation in the industry from care, that still seems like an area that could be bigger, capital market you have bulked up and you saw from that strength first half of the year. But obviously a really big kind of megabank they're getting the benefit in trading and investment banking from this unusual impairment. So thoughts on kind of organically or from the bolt on deal that you have done in the past focusing on those two areas?\nWilliam S. Demchak: I mean look, I wouldn't rule anything out. Neither those necessarily fit the longer-term strategic issues we're facing. But your mortgage is an interesting question because we've clearly seen some stress in the -- I'm going to say the non-capitalized mortgage players and to the extent that becomes a structural change in the industry, which would in turn cause mortgage itself to be more profitable for banks. Then we could look to grow that. At the moment, the structural challenges with the mortgage business, as you know, the costs to comply with various regulations, coupled with the capacity in the market just make it difficult to make money. Now, of course, we're in another refi boom and all that looks good at the moment. But long term, that's not necessarily true. If that changes and/or if the government agency model changes such that you have to deploy capital to be in the mortgage business, then that could be attractive. The capital markets business we purposefully have been careful in picking our spots in that. That is a business that in my experience, returns more to employees than it necessarily does to shareholders through the cycle and offers lower returns on capital through this cycle but maybe with some of the changes in [indiscernible] and the opportunities we are clearly seeing just in the ability to in effect broker trades and the margins in that maybe we would expand that. But we can do that organically, we wouldn\u2019t need to at all purchase something to do that.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay, helpful thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy, RBC. Please go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning Bill, good morning Rob.\nWilliam S. Demchak: Hey, good morning Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Bill can you share with us there's been a number of conflicting economic reports and this morning we see the entire manufacturing index turned positive for the first time since February, industrial production came in better than expected, but then when we look at the initial unemployment claims numbers then they're extremely high. When you talk to your business customers not so much the leisure or the restaurant type of customers but when you talk to your core customers what are they telling you about what they're seeing in their businesses today?\nWilliam S. Demchak: You know basically everybody is bluntly struggling. Nobody can figure out why the stock market is where it is. And everybody at the margin unless you are directly volume impacted for whatever reason by COVID in a positive way everybody's basically off. So industrial production comes back but it's still 11% down year-on-year. So when positive readings are positive readings from what was a really negative number. The struggle I'm personally having with a lot of the data as I watch continuing claims they publish a number of 17 million plus or minus people but there's 32 million people getting unemployment benefits today, right, because of the Cares Act special provision that allow sole proprietors and gig workers to get unemployment. So 32 million people getting unemployment out of 150 million U.S. workers. Yet we're saying the unemployment rates only whatever they're quoting today 13%. I can't connect the dots. I see the dollars that are coming in to a deposit balances and you see it from unemployment claims what you are causing our retail customers who are receiving unemployment on average to have higher balances than they had when they were employed which is in turn driving consumer spending in part of this economy. So Jamie went on this round, he is exactly right. We see consumers flushed with cash, we see no delinquencies, we see consumer spending increasing, and it's all at the moment based on government writing a check. And I just don't know how this plays out but the generic corporate client we talked to who's otherwise open and doing business is almost without exception down from what they would have expected going into the year and down from where they were last year for sure.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good and Rob and you may have touched on this in your presentation I mean it is listed in Slide 10 when you gave us the numbers on the forbearance or what you're doing in helping your customers from running -- can you share with us any color on the request for forbearance, I assume they're coming down from the peak probably in early April and how do you see that going forward?\nRobert Q. Reilly: Yeah, I did cover that Gerard. So I compared that peak were down which is mid-April we are down 97% in terms of new request. So our expectations again all things remaining equal that new request be pretty minimal. But, as Bill mentioned things are fluid.\nWilliam S. Demchak: Yeah and the other thing is we're just now coming off of that period of the initial requests and so it's frankly too early to really tell how many of those customers are going to ask for extension versus going back to their normal payment plans.\nRobert Q. Reilly: And I covered that as well. The payment that were made in the last 60 days on a percentage basis are pretty high. So that would suggest possibly lower modifications going forward but it is just too early.\nGerard Cassidy: Does that mean on the requests for people that are in some sort of forbearance when they come back to you is it an automatic approval or do you have a process in place where you actually look at the customer and say this one doesn't look like it's going to make it, we're going to put this into non-accrual. How does that process work on the people that we have for a second?\nWilliam S. Demchak: Yeah, we have a pretty detailed treatment plan that looks amongst other things just that the cash flow available to them from the balances we see and so forth. And, we'll work to come up with something that makes sense for the client. It's different the second time around than it was in the initial requests where effectively you just say fine and move on to the next phone call. So we're doing it case by case.\nGerard Cassidy: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of John McDonald, Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nJohn McDonald: Hey, good morning. Rob, wanted to ask you about the full year 2020 guidance and understanding what you said, there's a lot of uncertainty in the environment. Just first on the basis, is this on a continuing ops basis so we should think of it as kind of revenues and expenses, ex-BlackRock in 2019 and ex-BlackRock in 2020 is that how we're thinking of it?\nRobert Q. Reilly: Yeah, that's right, John. That's exactly right. BlackRock discontinued operations and removed from that guidance.\nJohn McDonald: Okay, so just kind of give me\u2026\nRobert Q. Reilly: Yeah that\u2019s right.\nJohn McDonald: Okay, and then I'm not sure if you mentioned this, but is it fair to us to expect like within reason, obviously, because it's a range down 2 to 5 that you'll manage within reason to shoot for positive operating leverage, like if revenues are down 3 you'll try to get expenses down 3 again within reason, is that something you're shooting for, should we think about that?\nRobert Q. Reilly: Yeah, sure. Sure, absolutely within reason. Yeah, hey we are pleased actually given everything that's happened in the first half of the year, that we have actually generated positive operating leverage. But the back half continues in the state of sort of unknown variables. So we filed it in and the message that I want to send is that we're very conscious and deliberate and disciplined around our expense management and, we'll work hard. That suggests somewhere flat operating leverage. Maybe we can do a little better than that to your point that remains to be seen.\nJohn McDonald: Okay, and then on the deposit service charges, you mentioned this a bit, just wanted to drill down, do we get any sense of how much of that decline in deposit service charge was due to fee forgiveness versus just kind of lower incidence and activity levels? Bill mentioned, consumers being flushed with cash and then U.S. banks said this morning, they expect theirs to bounce back a bit in the third quarter or still be down year-over-year, do you expect a similar kind of trend and maybe just flush it out?\nRobert Q. Reilly: No, no we do. And I would say just a rough rule of thumb, about 50:50, it is 50 in the waivers and 50 as reduced activity. And I do expect it to come back. Not necessarily back to all these levels, but up off of second quarter levels.\nJohn McDonald: In the third quarter?\nRobert Q. Reilly: Yes, and that's part of my guidance.\nJohn McDonald: For the flat kind of core fee revenue in the third quarter?\nRobert Q. Reilly: Yeah, core fee revenue is stable up on consumer to that point, probably down a bit on corporate services, just reflecting lower activity and then asset management and residential mortgage stable.\nJohn McDonald: OK. Thanks.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Brent Erensel with Portales Partners. Please go ahead.\nBrent Erensel: Brent Erensel, thank you. It's great to have a war chest during a pandemic. I have two specific questions on the national digital effort and the national mid-market effort and is it actually moving the needle in terms of the revenue wall that you and other regional banks are hitting? And then the second question would be on what you're seeing in Midland [ph] and the MBS [ph] commercial MBS experience, if you could update us on that?\nWilliam S. Demchak: Well just on moving the needle on revenues and I'll let Rob throw some figures at you in a second. But the C&I space where we have been at this for a number of years, it's starting to become a meaningful part of the total revenue inside of our C&IB franchise and it's growing at a much faster pace than our legacy markets. Including fees we're maintaining the cross-sell ratios that we had in our legacy markets. The retail effort in terms of profitability at this point is probably a drain, almost certainly a drain. But it is affording us the ability long term to be able to fund the growth in our C&IB expansion with core deposits as we build out our retail franchise. Collectively it's profitable.\nRobert Q. Reilly: The only thing I would add to that is that yes, the expansion markets in C&IB are doing quite well. One question we get is, what's the progress on the opening of Seattle and Portland, which we had teed up for this year, we have in fact hired there. It is a little bit slower than what we had planned for 2020. But we're growing and each of those markets contributed significantly in terms of the lion draws that we saw and the loan growth that we have seen.\nWilliam S. Demchak: On [indiscernible] servicing I think that the largest or close to it of servicers in the CMBS market, both on the master servicing side and importantly on the special servicing side, thus far we have seen as much as 0.5 billion a week I think the number is plus or minus rolling in to special servicing out of a balance. But we are actually a little over 200 billion in special servicing, about 150 billion of that is pure CMBS. And our guys would tell you that in the crisis we saw 12 billion moved to special servicing. They're expecting as much as 20 billion through this.\nRobert Q. Reilly: And we're a little less than half that.\nWilliam S. Demchak: Yeah, we're half of that now. That is an aside, that's obviously those aren't our assets. We are paid money to service those. We get paid a fee stream when they move into special servicing. We get paid a very nice interest stream when we advance on principal and interest. And ultimately we also get paid on resolution of those assets another fee stream. So it's large, it\u2019s is accelerating and it's profitable.\nBrent Erensel: Just to clarify, is it related to special servicer on 200 billion of value, I think you said we had 200 billion?\nWilliam S. Demchak: Sorry, we're designated special. We do it for others.\nBrent Erensel: So you're profiting. You're enjoying unusual profitability from this. Did you just 10 years ago as well?\nWilliam S. Demchak: Yes.\nBrent Erensel: Excellent, okay, thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.\nSaul Martinez: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I was hoping you could help me get a better sense of what the order of magnitude is in terms of how much PPP fees can actually help your net interest income and how much is sort of baked into your outlook because, you have about 37 billion of loans and it may not help you as much as some other regional banks, but certainly not chump change and if we do assume that a sizable proportion of that is forgiven, then if I just run 70% to 80% and I don't know if that's the right number and a 3% fee on that, we're talking about a few hundred million dollars of accrued over or recognized over a few quarters. So I want to get a sense as to whether you think my intuition and I guess my estimates are right first of all? And then second of all, Rob, I don't know if you've given or you have estimated or sorry provided numbers or how much is incorporated into your revenue guidance for the full year and your NII guidance for the third quarter, I don't know if you can give any sense as to the numbers there?\nRobert Q. Reilly: Yeah, I -- so one, it is built into my full year revenue guidance in terms of the PPP fees. Most of that, in terms of what I'm thinking about right now, would be in the fourth quarter. So not so much in the third quarter and then I think the issue is to what extent maybe some of that goes into 2021. So it's a real number but in the context of our total NII for the year it's high.\nWilliam S. Demchak: Yeah, I mean it's not hugely material, but if we're talking about -- dollars it's not. It certainly move the needle in a given quarter or even half a year. So -- but in fact or if I am thinking about it correctly in terms of what percentage could be forgiven I know there's huge uncertainty around that. But, we're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars here and in revenue that will be collected over the next three or recognized sorry, over the next few quarters.\nRobert Q. Reilly: Yeah, I think that's right. And like I said, that I built into my guidance.\nWilliam S. Demchak: Got it. Alright. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please go ahead.\nBrian Klock: Hey, good morning, guys. Rob I have questions for you on credit and I wanted to, I guess at first hand, actually more of a bourbon stand and single malt.\nRobert Q. Reilly: I was waiting for that to come up a little better. But I understand.\nBrian Klock: I read it somewhere, I think. But really I guess table 12 shows, I guess that one single mall, small REIT that\u2019s in the MCA, right. Yeah. Let's get it there. But can you talk about the criticized trends in the commercial I guess quarter-over-quarter I guess if you are thinking about it with some of the forbearance and those kinds of thing, you don\u2019t necessarily feed in the past views. So I guess I was wondering why the overall criticized commercial loan transfer quarter-over-quarter?\nRobert Q. Reilly: Yeah, so it is I would say sort of mid-teens, a little report that in terms of our reports, but criticize are up.\nWilliam S. Demchak: But one way to look at that is I don't remember the exact breakdown but when Rob went through the reasons for the increase in our provision, both economic and then specific credit that 500 million plus or minus was effectively the result of downgrades of credit. So you can think about that population that's been affected here as being covered by the downgrades that gave rise to that 500 plus or minus billion.\nBrian Klock: Got it, got it, that helped. It\u2019s a single mall REIT related credit. [Multiple Speakers]\nWilliam S. Demchak: You can say that fast.\nBrian Klock: And then maybe just one real quick follow-up and the guidance you talked about for expenses and revenues and positive operating leverage target and maybe the longer-term thought Bill and you guys have been able to function pretty well with your digital investment, with a lot of branches that you haven't reopened yet. Why, because of the pandemic, is there any sort of thought longer term about maybe not reopening some of those and closing some of those branches, even though you still have the digital reach of the branch expansion strategy nationally. But any thoughts on calling me or any market branches?\nWilliam S. Demchak: Yes, there's additional thought. I think -- and by the way, that wouldn't show up in run rate near-term because at this point it probably cost dollars to close something as it does for the savings. But what's clear is, is consumer behavior has changed and my belief is in a lot of ways it's changed permanently with this adoption to digital. So we'll have to adjust the way we serve our clients. And it is likely that that will mean less physical space.\nBrian Klock: Yes, thanks Bill. Thanks for your time guys.\nWilliam S. Demchak: Sure, thank you.\nOperator: And there are no further questions in the line.\nWilliam S. Demchak: Okay, thank you everybody. We will see you hopefully in the third quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "William S. Demchak",
            "content": "Thanks Bryan and good morning everybody. As you have seen this morning our results for the second quarter had a number of moving parts including obviously the gain on the sale of our stake in BlackRock. Now overall I thought it was a pretty solid quarter in the context of the environment that we are operating in. You would have seen that revenue was down from the first quarter, which, if you remember, included some kind of one off gains and expenses were well managed. We were able to produce positive operating leverage both in Q2 and for the first half of the year. However, as we mentioned in our first quarter call our view of the economy has substantially worsened since we closed the books three months ago and in turn has resulted in a substantial loan loss reserve bill. Our recent CCAR results should lay to rest any concern that this is a PNC specific balance sheet problem. The CCAR results underscore the strength of our balance sheet, which, coupled with the benefits of the monetization of our BlackRock investment position PNC with substantial capital and liquidity to continue to support our constituents and capitalize on opportunities that can arise during disruptive markets. In fact, our capital ratios are at record levels and we saw a significant increase in our book value. Looking ahead, I fully recognize that we are perhaps a bit more pessimistic than the market on the odds of a full recovery anytime soon. While recent economic data has been encouraging, we're still in the very early innings of how this is going to play out. Massive fiscal and monetary stimulus has allowed us to, in fact, kick the can down the road in terms of feeling the real effects of this recession. Much is going to depend on continuing support from the government as the economy continues to adjust with life with COVID. Unfortunately, what is becoming very clear, at least to me, is that there is a new normal that will have profound and lasting effects on parts of our economy and the workforce that supports it. Despite these challenging times in which you are navigating simultaneous crisis, both the pandemic and civil unrest caused by deep racial inequalities. PNC has remained steadfast in our commitment to our customers, communities, employees and shareholders. Despite the challenges of COVID we continue to make good progress in terms of executing on our key strategic focus areas, including national middle market expansion and our national digital efforts. Now, before I turn it over to Rob, I want to recognize and thank our employees who are going above and beyond to help our customers address the many challenges that they are facing. I also want to thank my leadership team including Carole Brown and Richard Bynum, the newest members of our executive committee, for their invaluable support during this time. And finally, I want to thank our Board of Directors for their leadership as we continue to navigate what has been a year of both extraordinary challenges and opportunities. Now I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our second quarter results and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Yeah, no real changes. We're going to be patient here. You know, I think, like I said in my script, we're in pretty early innings here to see how this all plays out. The fiscal payments that the government's put out plus what the Fed's done is, effectively masked what are some pretty severe underlying problems in the economy. And depending on how fast that comes back and/or if the government keeps providing stimulus, it'll tell us how much of that capital we need in the first place and secondly, what the opportunities will be to deploy it. So we're going to be patient. The strategy of trying to pursue bank like acquisitions to help us expand our national franchise remains the same. Hey, good morning. I mean, mechanically, if all else holds true on assumptions, you roll down and then burn off the reserve with your charge offs and you add life of the loan reserves for whatever new loans come on and in effect, you'd be adding provision for new loans and everything else would put salt to zero, if everything else held equal which most certainly won't. First of all, if we get into an environment where somehow buybacks are allowed in the fourth quarter, I'm not sure where he was going with that in terms of maybe he's hearing something from the Fed I'm not. But ignoring that, just assume that there were no restrictions at the moment for the Fed. I continue to believe, that we are going to see opportunities both organic and inorganic in this environment to deploy that capital in a very shareholder friendly way. At the margin, would we use some of our capital to support our share price? Of course we would, but that would be value dependent and it would be also dependent on the environment that we're operating in and whether or not we saw confirmation of our belief that there'll be opportunities or not. So it's we'll see. I mean, you've heard me use the phrase over and over again that will be rational stewards of your capital. And that hasn't changed. I don't know that we necessarily think differently about it strategically. We've had a focus and we'll continue our focus through time on organic growth of our consumer lending balances as we simply try to penetrate existing clients. And then to the extent we acquire clients is the same thing. Our business model is basically built on our ability to go to new markets and profitably build share, not just through lending, but through heavy cross-sell and to fund that through our national digital expansion. So, it's less of a focus on do I need to somehow change the mix of what we're doing as opposed to can we accelerate the actual growth of what we're doing in the environment that we're in and coming into. And our belief is that we'll be able to do that. Inside of that, as we look at different opportunities, might things change at the margin. Sure, but it's not by design. It's basically they take what we have and grow it even faster than we have historically. There's nothing in the list that we think we need to have that we don't have. We want to take our existing products and services and go to market strategy and do that in more markets. This issue is something financial versus strategic. The issue of and we'd obviously look at both, the issue of doing a purely financial transaction is one of -- does it cause us to take our eye off the ball in terms of our long-term growth potential, does it mean we wouldn't do it, and what we would do with financial proceeds is accelerate organic growth. But ideally we'd find something that's both very financially attractive and matches our strategic agenda of expanding our geography. The thought process is, you know, it sounds a little bit wrong, but to make that decision or worry about that if in fact we get into that environment. At the moment, we're in the middle of an environment where we -- I think Mike Corbett [ph] said this yesterday that there's more we don't know than we do. It is really unclear what the long-term damage is going to be to the economy and how long it's going to take to grow back. And our focus right now is to make sure we have in Jamie's words, a fortress balance sheet that we're serving our customers, that we're opportunistic inside of what is a fairly strange environment at the moment. And we'll sit and watch. And if all of that changes then of course, we'll change and replan and regroup and refocus and so forth. But today, none of that has changed. So we continue to, of course, and I know you guys want to sort of somehow drive us into a corner that says, the following three things happen then are you going to do A, B or C. And my brain can't do that math. So we're not going to go down that path. I mean look, I wouldn't rule anything out. Neither those necessarily fit the longer-term strategic issues we're facing. But your mortgage is an interesting question because we've clearly seen some stress in the -- I'm going to say the non-capitalized mortgage players and to the extent that becomes a structural change in the industry, which would in turn cause mortgage itself to be more profitable for banks. Then we could look to grow that. At the moment, the structural challenges with the mortgage business, as you know, the costs to comply with various regulations, coupled with the capacity in the market just make it difficult to make money. Now, of course, we're in another refi boom and all that looks good at the moment. But long term, that's not necessarily true. If that changes and/or if the government agency model changes such that you have to deploy capital to be in the mortgage business, then that could be attractive. The capital markets business we purposefully have been careful in picking our spots in that. That is a business that in my experience, returns more to employees than it necessarily does to shareholders through the cycle and offers lower returns on capital through this cycle but maybe with some of the changes in [indiscernible] and the opportunities we are clearly seeing just in the ability to in effect broker trades and the margins in that maybe we would expand that. But we can do that organically, we wouldn't need to at all purchase something to do that. Hey, good morning Gerard. You know basically everybody is bluntly struggling. Nobody can figure out why the stock market is where it is. And everybody at the margin unless you are directly volume impacted for whatever reason by COVID in a positive way everybody's basically off. So industrial production comes back but it's still 11% down year-on-year. So when positive readings are positive readings from what was a really negative number. The struggle I'm personally having with a lot of the data as I watch continuing claims they publish a number of 17 million plus or minus people but there's 32 million people getting unemployment benefits today, right, because of the Cares Act special provision that allow sole proprietors and gig workers to get unemployment.

So -- but in fact or if I am thinking about it correctly in terms of what percentage could be forgiven I know there's huge uncertainty around that. But, we're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars here and in revenue that will be collected over the next three or recognized sorry, over the next few quarters. Got it. Alright.

            "name": "Robert Q. Reilly",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill. And good morning, everyone. As Bill just mentioned and notable during the second quarter, we divested our equity investment in BlackRock, which generated $14.2 billion in net proceeds with an after tax gain of $4.3 billion. PNC's portion of BlackRock results both second quarter activity and prior periods are now reported as discontinued operations. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. On the asset side total loans grew $24.5 billion to $268 billion linked quarter. Our investment securities of $88 billion increased $4 billion or 5%. Our cash balances at the Federal Reserve averaged $34 billion and were $50 billion at the end of the quarter. The significant increase was a result of liquidity from the sale of our investment in BlackRock and strong deposit growth. On the liability side, deposit balances averaged $335 billion for the quarter and were up $45 billion or 16% linked quarter. Total borrowed funds decreased $4 billion compared to the first quarter. Importantly, on a spot basis borrowed funds declined approximately $26 billion as we used excess liquidity to reduce borrowings, primarily with the Federal Home Loan Bank. And our tangible book value was $93.54 per common share as of June 30th, an increase of 10% linked quarter and 16% year-over-year. As you can see on Slide 5, our capital reserve and liquidity positions are all strong. As of June 30, 2020, our Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated to be 11.3%. Our Board recently approved a quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share, which is consistent with the previous quarter. As you know, the Fed has authorized dividends for the third quarter subject to amounts not exceeding the average of net income for the preceding four quarters. On this basis our third quarter dividend is 27% of our average net income for the prior four quarters. In regard to share repurchases and in accordance with the Federal Reserve's guidance, we'll continue to suspend share repurchases through the third quarter, with the exception of permissible employee benefit related purchases. Our loan loss reserve levels have increased substantially in light of the current economic conditions and are now at 2.55%. We remain core funded with a low cost deposit base and importantly, our liquidity coverage ratios significantly exceed the regulatory minimum requirements. Slide 6 shows our average loans and deposits in more detail. Average loan balances of $268 billion in the second quarter were up $25 billion or 10% compared to the first quarter. This growth reflected an increase in commercial loan balances of approximately $25 billion, driven by higher utilization related to line draws, short-term liquidity facilities to support our clients, and new loan balances under the paycheck protection program. Consumer loans declined approximately $700 million, reflecting lower activity in card, auto, and student loans. It's worth noting that spot loans declined $6.4 billion, predominantly related to lower commercial loan utilization. Our C&IB segment experienced a 5.5% decline in utilization rates from peak levels, as approximately 75% of the lines that were drawn were subsequently paid down. At quarter end, utilization rates were approximately 1% above pre-COVID rates. Compared to the same period a year ago average loans grew 14% or $33 billion. As the slide shows the yield on our loan balances declined 71 basis points to 3.37% in the second quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of the Fed's 150 basis point reduction in interest rates during the first quarter, which drove LIBOR rates lower as well. The rate paid on our deposits also declined 47 basis points linked quarter to 23 basis points. Average deposit balances of $335 billion increased $45 billion or 16% linked quarter. Commercial deposits grew reflecting the enhanced liquidity positions of our customers due to COVID-19 concerns. Consumer deposits also grew primarily due to government stimulus payments and lower consumer spending. Year-over-year deposits increased $62 billion or 23%. As you can see on Slide 7 second quarter total revenue was $4.1 billion, down $260 million linked quarter or 6%. Net interest income of $2.5 billion was up $16 million or 1% compared to the first quarter as higher earning asset balances and lower funding costs offset lower yields. Our net interest margin decreased to 2.52%, down 32 basis points linked quarter reflecting the full quarter impact of the 150 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate during March 2020 and the related decline in other market rates. Non-interest income of $1.6 billion declined $276 million or 15% linked quarter. Fee revenue decreased $204 million or 14%. Consumer services and service charges on deposits declined by $136 million in total due to lower consumer activity and fee waivers in the second quarter. Residential mortgage production volumes and loan sales revenues were both higher but were more than offset by a lower RMSR evaluation. And asset management and corporate services remained relatively stable. Other non-interest income declined $72 million, reflecting lower securities gains partially offset by strong client activity in corporate securities and capital markets. Non-interest expense declined $28 million or 1% compared to the first quarter due to lower business activity, as well as continued progress on our cost savings initiatives related to our continuous improvement program. As Bill mentioned, we generated positive operating leverage for the second quarter, both year-over-year and year-to-date. Provision for credit losses was $2.5 billion, reflecting the worsening of our economic outlook relative to March, which I'll provide more detail on in a moment. And our effective tax rate was 17.5%. Slide 8 is an update to the template we introduced in the first quarter regarding specific industries we've identified as most likely to be impacted by the effects of the pandemic. Our outstanding loan balances as of June 30th to these industries are $19.6 billion and represent approximately 8% of our total loan portfolio. We haven't yet experienced any material charge offs in these industries, however, if current economic trends continue, we'll see charge offs increase over time. Corporate loan balances in these industries totaled $11.5 billion, an increase of approximately $900 million since March 31st resulting from funding of $2 billion of PPP loans. Excluding the PPP loans balances are down approximately 10%. Non-performing loans in these industries were flat linked quarter at just under 1% of loan outstanding but criticized assets did grow during the quarter with the greatest stress seen in leisure, recreation, and travel. We have 8.1 billion in loans to high impact industries and our commercial real estate portfolio, a decrease of approximately $600 million since the end of March. Non-performing loans in the real estate categories increased from approximately $5 million at March 31st to just over $140 million, driven almost entirely by a single mall REIT related credit. Similar to last quarter we continued to see substantial stress in the retail and lodging segments. Turning to Slide 9, this is an update on our oil and gas portfolio, which at the end of the second quarter was $4.1 billion, or less than 2% of total outstanding loans. Outstanding loan balances have declined approximately $500 million since March 31, 2020. As expected, we continue to see an increase in the non-performing loans, which now represent approximately 4% of current outstandings in this portfolio. We believe we are properly reserved for this portfolio and we'll continue to monitor market conditions. Turning to Slide 10, we're continuing to provide relief and flexibility to our customers through loan modifications during these uncertain times. With our consumer customers who are granting loan modifications through extensions, deferrals, and forbearance, new requests for modifications have declined 97% from their peak in early April but year-to-date we've granted assistance to nearly 280,000 customer accounts. Representing $12.7 billion of loans, excuse me, 6.6 billion of which is investor owned and 6.1 billion, which is bank owned. Of the 6.1 billion bank owned modification they continue to represent a small percentage of both overall accounts and total loan exposures for each asset class. And a significant percentage of clients have made at least one payment in the last 60 days. Although these payments suggest a potential decrease in modifications as extension periods begin to expire, we believe it's too early to make that conclusion. On the commercial side we're offering emergency relief for small and medium sized businesses, including to the PPP loans. We're also selectively granting loan modifications to commercial clients based on each individual borrower's situation. Our credit quality metrics are presented on Slide 11. Net charge offs for loans and leases where $236 million, a $24 million increase from the first quarter. Annualized net charge offs to total loans remained stable at 35 basis point. Total delinquencies of $1.3 billion at June 30th declined $173 million or 12% reflecting a decline in delinquencies related to the Cares Act as well as other forbearance and extension fees. Non-performing loans increased $232 million or 14%, compared to March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by commercial real estate borrowers and the high impact COVID-19 industries, as well as borrowers in the energy industry, which I previously mentioned. As you can see the allowance for credit losses to loans has increased to 2.55% in the second quarter, compared to 1.66% last quarter, primarily resulting from our updated economic forecasts, which incorporate a significant COVID-19 impact on the economy. Importantly, we believe the economic assumptions used in the scenarios generate our CECL reserve estimates this quarter, sufficiently reflect the life of loan losses in our current portfolio. Therefore, we don't anticipate any substantial reserve bills during the remainder of 2020 based on these assumptions, which I will cover next. The recent CCAR results highlight the quality of PNC's loan portfolio. Under the severely adverse scenario our cumulative losses as a percentage of our total portfolio were lower than most of our peers. However, based on our economic outlook under the CECL methodology, we did have a substantial increase in our allowance this quarter. Slide 12 highlights the drivers of the increase to our allowance for credit losses. Our attribution shows the increase in reserves of $557 million for portfolio changes and approximately $1.6 billion for economic factors. Our weighted average economic scenario is derived from four separate scenarios and uses a number of economic variables, with the largest drivers being GDP and the unemployment rate. In this scenario, annualized GDP contract 6.2% in the third quarter of 2020, finishing the year down 4.9% from the fourth quarter 2019 levels and recovering to prerecession peak levels by the first quarter of 2022. Additionally, this scenario assumes the quarterly unemployment rate falls to 9.5% in the fourth quarter of this year, from a peak at 13.6% in the second quarter, with the labor market continuing to recover in 2021 and 2022. For internal analytical purposes we also considered hypothetically what our capital ratios would be if we had a year-end 2020 allowance for credit losses equal to the nine quarter Fed CCAR severely adverse scenario losses, a $12.1 billion essentially fund loading an incremental $5.5 billion in reserves over the next two quarters. I want to emphasize this scenario is not our expectation, but simply approximate the possible outcome under a hypothetical severe condition. The analysis resulted in a CET 1 ratio of approximately 10% at December 31, 2020, a level well above 7%, which is our regulatory minimum of 4.5%, plus our stress capital buffer of 2.5%. In summary, from a capital liquidity and loan loss reserve perspective, we believe our balance sheet is well positioned for this challenging environment. Clearly, the biggest variables impacting the economy continue to be the duration of this crisis and the efficacy of the massive U.S. government support and stimulus programs. At this time we have no way of knowing these outcomes and visibility remains low. Within that context, our guidance for the third quarter and our thoughts for the full year are as follows. For the third quarter of 2020, compared to the second quarter of 2020, we expect the average loans to decline in the low single-digit range. We expect net interest income to be down approximately 1%. We expect total non-interest income to be down between 3% and 5%, which includes our expectation that core fee revenue will be stable while other non-interest income will be lower in the quarter. We expect total non-interest expense to be flat to down. And in regard to net charge offs, we expect third quarter levels to be between $250 million and $350 million. For the full year and again I want to emphasize the context and limitation of low visibility, we now expect both revenue and non-interest expense to each be down between 2% and 5% and our effective tax rate is now expected to be in the low teens. And with that Bill and I are ready to take your questions. Hey, good morning John. Yeah, hey John its Rob. Good morning. We don't provide NIM guidance so to speak because it's an outcome. But I would say generally speaking I expect margins to remain sort of stable. We will clearly see some lower yields as a function of rate being lower. But we also have some more room on the liability side. I think largely the loss side. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, so we might see a little bit of a lift in the fourth quarter, but essentially these are the NIM levels where I think we'll be at some time. Yeah, I think I'll answer it sort of backwards there. I think, in retrospect, I think it largely came in as we expected softer on the consumer side, which we did expect as a function of the lower activity as well as the fee waivers. Corporate services was actually pretty strong, down a little bit. But, some good activity there that might have been a little better than what we expected. And then asset management and mortgage both came in with expectations, asset management relatively flat, mortgage up a bit in terms of production. We had that large RMSR gain in the first quarter so we were down quarter-over-quarter but production levels were outside. I think in retrospect they came in as we expected. Going forward in terms of stable for the third quarter and again, you know Scott, it's fluid so visibility is low. But I'd expect consumer services actually to pick up a little bit, corporate services maybe to fall off a little bit. And asset management and residential mortgage essentially stable. And again that's with the caveat of the environment and how much consumer activity actually happens. Well, you know, Bill may want to chime in too, we are -- you're getting ahead of ourselves there a little bit in terms of how we positioned it now. But it's going to be a function of the models, obviously, which we'll continue to run through the balance of the year and next year. And at some point when those just by definition, when those scenarios improve, provided that you didn't need the reserves for charge offs you'd start to release. That's a CECL definition. Yeah, that's right. And I think the distinction just in terms of the components of the calculation which our portfolio changes, which incorporates the levels of loans and then the economic assumptions. Yeah. Yes, sure. Yeah, hey Erika. So, we will put some of that to work tactically, we won't put all of it to work, obviously. And given particularly in terms of securities yields it's pretty hard to make up a lot of revenue deploying that. So, we're going to run with some pretty high cash balances to the balance of the year. But as far as security side, deployment, loan, loan balances, that's all factored into our guidance. And I would just add to that. We're fairly confident that an opportunity will arise. And if it does we will do it. Yeah, I did cover that Gerard. So I compared that peak were down which is mid-April we are down 97% in terms of new request. So our expectations again all things remaining equal that new request be pretty minimal. But, as Bill mentioned things are fluid. And I covered that as well. The payment that were made in the last 60 days on a percentage basis are pretty high. So that would suggest possibly lower modifications going forward but it is just too early. Yeah, that's right, John. That's exactly right. BlackRock discontinued operations and removed from that guidance. Yeah that's right. Yeah, sure. Sure, absolutely within reason. Yeah, hey we are pleased actually given everything that's happened in the first half of the year, that we have actually generated positive operating leverage. But the back half continues in the state of sort of unknown variables. So we filed it in and the message that I want to send is that we're very conscious and deliberate and disciplined around our expense management and, we'll work hard. That suggests somewhere flat operating leverage. Maybe we can do a little better than that to your point that remains to be seen. No, no we do. And I would say just a rough rule of thumb, about 50:50, it is 50 in the waivers and 50 as reduced activity. And I do expect it to come back. Not necessarily back to all these levels, but up off of second quarter levels. Yes, and that's part of my guidance. Yeah, core fee revenue is stable up on consumer to that point, probably down a bit on corporate services, just reflecting lower activity and then asset management and residential mortgage stable. The only thing I would add to that is that yes, the expansion markets in C&IB are doing quite well. One question we get is, what's the progress on the opening of Seattle and Portland, which we had teed up for this year, we have in fact hired there. It is a little bit slower than what we had planned for 2020. But we're growing and each of those markets contributed significantly in terms of the lion draws that we saw and the loan growth that we have seen. And we're a little less than half that. Yeah, I -- so one, it is built into my full year revenue guidance in terms of the PPP fees. Most of that, in terms of what I'm thinking about right now, would be in the fourth quarter. So not so much in the third quarter and then I think the issue is to what extent maybe some of that goes into 2021. So it's a real number but in the context of our total NII for the year it's high. Yeah, I think that's right. And like I said, that I built into my guidance. I was waiting for that to come up a little better. But I understand. Yeah, so it is I would say sort of mid-teens, a little report that in terms of our reports, but criticize are up."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PNC Financial Services Group Earnings Conference Call.All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.I will now turn the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bryan Gill. Sir, please go ahead.\nBryan Gill: Hello. Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO.Today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today\u2019s earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These materials are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of April 15, 2020 and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill.\nWilliam Demchak: Thanks Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you've seen this morning, our results for the quarter were solid on a pre-provision basis, but the extraordinary changes in the economic backdrop occurring in March and the implications of the broad-based response to the COVID-19 breakout had a material impact on our provision for credit losses.Before we go into the financials, I want to acknowledge the current environment. Obviously, this pandemic is having a profound impact on the global economy and on people's lives and the challenges we face as a country are unprecedented. PNC through this period is navigating these challenges from a position of strength.We have nearly 52,000 employees who are working incredibly hard to serve our customers. We immediately mobilized to mitigate the risks to our frontline employees and implemented enhanced pay provisions for those in roles that can't be performed remotely.Our technology, in which we've invested heavily over time, allowed us to quickly transition to a remote work model for more than 30,000 of our employees, including those from our call center who are managing a very high call volume from the safety of their homes. Our technology also allowed us to quickly prepare for and respond to the federal government's economic stimulus package, which we are supporting through loans and other relief to consumer and business customers.As an aside, since launching our online paycheck protection program portal on April 3, we've received over 75,000 applications. And we have thousands of people working tirelessly to process these loan requests in accordance with the SBA's requirements, including documentation and have registered at this point, actually as of this morning, something over $6 billion worth of these loans.Also, the convenience and security of our mobile and online banking tools are allowing us to continue to provide critical banking services with minimal disruption. Despite the current economic challenges, we are confident in our ability to continue to withstand strong environmental headwinds. We have solid liquidity and capital positions. We grew loans by $25 billion and deposits by $17 billion compared to the end of the fourth quarter.While this was largely driven by draws on commercial lines of credit, as Rob's going to take you through, we have provided new loans to support key industries in our country since the COVID outbreak, including over $2 billion in new loans to hospitals and other health care entities and $1 billion in new loans to municipalities.As in the side, over the last few weeks and into April, we've seen the rate of loan draws normalize. In addition, we've seen a meaningful increase in deposits, with the growth in dollars now equal to the loan growth since the outbreak of COVID-19. We're processing thousands of forbearance and loan modification requests for consumers.Today, consumer modifications, we've had 41,000 processed \u2013 sorry, as of April 12. Importantly, of the 41,000, 20,000 of these are bank owned, with the remainder being for loans that we service for others. This may be the greatest challenge that many in our country have ever experienced. Many of our clients are experiencing financial hardship and despite their uncertainties, our commitment to them is as certain as it has ever been.Now, our results for the first quarter are shown on slide 4. And while pre-provision earnings increased 7%, the provision for credit losses of $914 million increased $693 million, reflecting the new CECL standard. While we developed our economic scenario to account for COVID-19, I want to say that, the economy has worsened since we closed the books on these numbers.Now, Rob will provide insight on how our scenarios have been impacted by some developments and how we would fare if the situation was to become more severe. In that instance, we would still be well capitalized, highly liquid and be able to maintain our dividend, while complying with capital standardsRob is going to take you through the income statement, but one thing I wanted to point out inside of our non-interest income as our security gains, which were higher than usual this quarter. And we realized these gains by taking advantage of some of the disruption in the fixed income markets that occurred before the Fed stepped in. And we still managed to increase our book yield on securities quarter-over-quarter. So if you think about it, normally, you sell securities and you replace them in your book yield goes down. In this instance, we actually increased our book yield and securities.Before I turn it over to Rob, I want to recognize and thank our employees, who are going above and beyond every day to help our customers address the many challenges that they are facing. Additionally, our regional presidents together with a PNC Foundation are playing a critical role and upholding our commitment to the communities we serve by allocating critical funds to coronavirus relief efforts across our markets.And with that \u2013 with that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our first quarter results, and then we'll be happy to take your questions.\nRobert Reilly: Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on slide 5 and is presented on a spot basis. While we typically cover our average balance sheet, we're going to focus on our spot balances this quarter due to the substantial increased activity late in the quarter related to the economic impact of COVID-19.On the asset side, loan balances of $265 billion at March 31, were up $25 billion, or 10% compared to December 31, 2019. This growth reflected an increase in commercial loan balances of approximately $24 billion, primarily driven by higher utilization of loan commitments.Investment securities of $91 billion increased $3.7 billion, or 4% linked quarter. Also, our cash balances at the Federal Reserve as of March 31, 2020, were $20 billion, down $3.6 billion from year-end, in part due to the benefits from the regulatory tailoring rules on our liquidity effective January 1, 2020.On the liability side, deposit balances of $305 billion at March 31, were up $17 billion or 6% compared to December 31, 2019. A high proportion of the commercial loan draws were placed back with us in the form of deposits. And as a result, non-interest-bearing deposits grew $8.8 billion or 12% linked quarter. Total borrowed funds increased $13 billion due to higher FHLB borrowings, and increased debt issuance activity during the quarter.As of March 31, 2020, our Basel III Common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated to be 9.4%, which reflected the impact of the tailoring rules, including our decision to opt out of AOCI, as well as our election to phase in CECL's impact on our estimated regulatory capital.While our capital ratios remained strong, on March 16, 2020, we announced the temporary suspension of our common stock repurchase program in conjunction with the Federal Reserve's effort to support the U.S. economy during this time. It did not impact PNC's dividend policy.Our tangible book value was $84.93 per common share as of March 31, an increase of 9% compared to a year ago. Our loan-to-deposit ratio was 87% at March 31st. And importantly, our liquidity coverage ratio exceeded the regulatory minimum requirement.As you can see on Slide 6, commercial loan and funded commitments declined by approximately $16 billion, as customers grew down lines to bolster their liquidity or replace alternative funding channels. As a result, our utilization rate increased from 55% to 61%.The drawdowns we've experienced are diversified across industries, and more than two-thirds of the increased utilization is from investment-grade borrowers. While drawdowns were well above normal in mid-March, we saw activity begin to slow at the end of the quarter and that's remained the case so far during the second quarter.That said we do expect loan balances to be elevated for some time. Importantly, PNC is well positioned with strong capital and liquidity. And we're committed to putting our resources to work to support our customers and the broader financial system at this critical time.As you can see on the slide, as of March 31, we had approximately $140 billion of readily available liquidity from diverse sources. These sources, along with substantially more availability from the Fed discount window, should it be necessary, provide ample funding to meet the potential needs of our customers.Turning to Slide 7, we're working to provide relief and flexibility to our customers through a variety of solutions during this time. On the commercial side, we're offering emergency relief for small and medium-sized business loans, including those being provided through the federally enacted Cares Act.We have received thousands of applications through the Paycheck protection program and have begun to fund those loans successfully, as Bill just mentioned. Additionally, we're granting loan modifications to commercial clients, primarily in the form of principal and/or interest deferrals.We're analyzing and making decisions on these modifications based on each individual borrower situation. With our consumer customers, we're also granting loan modifications through extensions, deferrals and forbearance.As of April 13, we have completed over 41,000 consumer loan modifications, primarily related to COVID-19. And in addition, we're offering relief in the form of extended grace periods and halting all foreclosures, while waiving certain fees and charges.As you can see on Slide 8, first quarter total revenue was $4.5 billion, down $92 million linked quarter or 2%. Net interest income of $2.5 billion was up $23 million or 1%. And compared to the fourth quarter, as lower funding costs as well as higher loan and security balances were partially offset by lower loan yields and one less day in the quarter.Our net interest margin increased to 2.84%, up 6 basis points linked quarter, in large part due to lower rates paid on deposits. Non-interest income declined $115 million or 5% linked quarter, reflecting stable fee revenue that was offset by, lower other non-interest income.Non-interest expense declined $219 million or 8% compared to the fourth quarter with all categories essentially flat to down. Our efficiency ratio was 56% in the first quarter, improving from 60% in the previous quarter. Provision for credit losses in the first quarter was $914 million, reflecting the adoption of the CECL methodology, including the economic effects of COVID-19 and loan growth. And our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 13.7%.In light of the current economic circumstances related to COVID-19, naturally we're evaluating and monitoring our entire loan portfolio. However, we believe the industry sector is likely to be most impacted are on slide 9.Our outstanding loan balances as of March 31 to these industries are $19.3 billion and represents 7% of our total loan portfolio. Corporate loan balances in these industries totaled $10.6 billion. Within this group, we're most focused on our exposures to retail, restaurants and certain parts of leisure travel. In retail, total loans outstanding are $2.5 billion, 60% of which are asset based. Restaurant loan outstandings are $1.2 billion and cruise lines and commercial airlines together total less than $600 million.In our commercial real estate portfolio, we have $8.7 billion in outstanding in areas most likely to be impacted by COVID-19. This includes CRE properties of $5.1 billion, 60% of which are stabilized and 40% under construction, all with a portfolio LTV of 55%. The remaining $3.5 billion of exposure is to REIT approximately two-thirds of which are investment grade.Turning to slide 10. This is an update on our oil and gas portfolio given the continued pressures on the energy industry. At the end of the first quarter, we had total outstandings of $4.6 billion in oil and gas loans, or just less than 2% of our total outstanding loans. We last updated you on this portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2016, while we were relatively pleased with the performance of this portfolio through the last oil and gas downturn of 2016, especially with respect to reserve-based lending structures.Accordingly, the growth in our portfolio since 2016 has been primarily in the upstream segment, which carry these structures as well as the midstream segments, which tend to perform relatively well under stress. Nearly all of our losses from the 2016 downturn occurred in our services book, which has declined as a percentage of total loans from the fourth quarter of 2016 and notably, approximately $900 million or 74% of the $1.2 billion of this sector is asset based. We will continue to monitor market conditions and actively manage our energy portfolio.Our credit quality metrics are presented on Slide 11. Net charge-offs for loans and leases were stable with the fourth quarter, increasing slightly by $3 million. Annualized net charge-offs to total loans was also stable with the fourth quarter at 35 basis points.Non-performing loans increased $9 million or 1% compared to December 31, 2019, and total delinquencies declined $21 million linked quarter or 1%. The ratios for both non-performing loans to total loans and delinquencies to total loans decreased in the quarter.As you can see, our provision for first quarter 2020 increased substantially to $914 million, reflecting the adoption of the CECL methodology, including the economic effects of COVID-19 and loan growth. Since the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, we've increased our reserves by approximately $1.3 billion. As a result, at March 31, our allowance for credit losses, including unfunded balances to total loans was 1.66%, and our allowance to non-performing loans was 240%.Slide 12 shows the drivers of the increase to our allowance for credit losses and ultimately our provision under CECL. Our attribution shows the increase in reserves for the CECL day one transition adjustment of $642 million, as well as portfolio changes and economic factors.Portfolio changes represent the impact of shifts in loan balances, age and mix as well as credit quality and net charge-off activity. These factors accounted for $196 million of the change in our reserves for the first quarter of 2020.Economic factors represent our evaluation and determination of an economic forecast applied to our loan portfolios. To accomplish this, we use a three-year reasonable and supportable forecast period and a weighted average of four different economic scenarios at quarter end.Importantly, each of these scenarios, were designed to address at the time the emerging COVID-19 crisis. This approach provided a blended scenario as of March 31, which when compared to the scenarios used for our transition calculation, resulted in an increase in reserves of $496 million for the first quarter.For this blended approach, we used a number of economic variables with the largest driver being GDP. In this scenario, annualized GDP contracted 11.2% in the second quarter of 2020 and finishes the year down 2.3% with recovery of the pre recession peak levels occurring by the fourth quarter of 2021.Since the end of the first quarter, when we finalized our CECL estimate, the macroeconomic backdrop has worsened, suggesting a deeper decline in GDP and other economic factors than what our March 31 scenario contemplated.Should these macroeconomic factors persist, we'll adjust our blended scenario accordingly, which would likely result in a material build to our reserves during the second quarter.Additionally, for our own stress informational purposes, we consider our most extreme adverse scenario in isolation to determine a hypothetical year-end 2020 capital and liquidity impact.This scenario is even more severe than the 2020 CCAR severely adverse scenario. It assumes a 30% annualized contraction in GDP in the second quarter of 2020, followed by another 20% annualized contraction in the third quarter, leading to a peak to trough decline of 14%. This compares to the CCAR severely adverse scenario, peak to trough decline of 8.5%.To be clear, this scenario is not our expectation nor does this exercise attempt to capture all the potential unknown variables that would likely arise, but simply provides an approximation of outcome under these circumstances. This results in an approximately 8.5% CET1 ratio at year-end 2020, and we believe would allow us to continue to support our current dividend.In summary, looking at the remainder of the year, we expect a challenging environment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect a significant contraction in GDP and we expect the Fed funds rate to remain in its current range of zero to 25 basis points throughout 2020.Clearly, the biggest variables impacting the economy will be the length of the crisis and the efficacy of the massive U.S. government support and stimulus programs. While we're hopeful the duration will be short and the government programs prove highly effective, at this time, we naturally have no way of knowing these outcomes.Accordingly, our visibility is low. However, based on what we think now, we can provide a second quarter guidance and some directional thoughts for the full year.For the second quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2020, we expect growth in average loans to be in the high-single-digit range as a result of the increased spot level at quarter end as well as additional anticipated funding needs of our commercial and consumer customers.We expect NII to be stable. We expect total noninterest income to be down approximately 15% to 20%, mostly reflecting the elevated MSRs and security gains that we generated amidst the volatility during the first quarter. We also expect some general softening in fee categories as well, particularly service charges on deposits, while we continue to weigh fees for our customers during this crisis.We expect total non-interest expense to be flat to down. And in regard to net charge-offs, we expect second quarter levels to be between $250 million and $350 million, up quarter-over-quarter as we begin to experience the economic effects of the crisis. For the full year and for the reasons previously stated, our visibility is substantially limited. But with that in mind, we now expect both full year revenue and non-interest expense to each be down between 5% and 10%.And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nErika Najarian: Hi, Good morning.\nRobert Reilly: Good morning, Erika.\nErika Najarian: Very much appreciate the comments on the extremely adverse scenario as we think about the dividend. I'm wondering, as you think about your company run test in a severely adverse scenario, I think last year, over nine quarters, you estimated losses of 4.2%. And I'm wondering, you clearly that's the difference in unemployment rate. What's different from a negative, obviously, from that scenario of this economic outlook that we're staring down at versus the severely adverse and what's better? And how the cumulative losses, yes, compared to that 4.2%?\nWilliam Demchak: Well, just on cumulative losses, the scenario we ran and jump in here where you want, Rob, basically had us coming up with losses of $10 billion in 2020, whereas the severe -- the severely adverse in CCAR had roughly $10 billion over the nine quarters.\nRobert Reilly: And\u2026\nWilliam Demchak: It's much worse. Maybe that's a simple soundbite to it.\nRobert Reilly: Yes. Erika, that's exactly right. So it's more severe in the sense that we front end those losses into the next nine months whereas CCAR and DFAST contemplated that over nine quarters.\nWilliam Demchak: And the peak to trough, what do we do on GDP?\nRobert Reilly: About 14%\nWilliam Demchak: Versus 8% on\u2026\nRobert Reilly: 8.5, yes,\nWilliam Demchak: 8.5 adverse.\nRobert Reilly: That's right. So much sharper and faster.\nWilliam Demchak: Yeah.\nErika Najarian: Just to clarify the question, I'm wondering what you think your cumu losses could actually be. So there's that extremely adverse scenario with that $10 billion shock in 2020 and then we have that other data point of severely adverse. So wondering what the -- based on what you know now cumulative losses could look like?\nWilliam Demchak: That's an unanswerable question. So what we tried to do was barbell it for you. We would tell you and I had this in my script that since we closed the books, we saw claims be higher than we had assumed. We changed from thinking that a V-shaped recovery was going to happen fast into more of a U-shaped recovery. So that's why we kind of put comments out there that we're going to have a reserve build likely into the second quarter.If we had perfect foresight here, the reserve true-up we would have taken in the first quarter would have effectively marked our book to current economy and future provision would simply be based on growth. So it would go way down. In practice, given we're seeing the economy worsen from our assumptions, again, sort of dragging out further unemployment a little bit higher, we'll see reserve build into the second quarter. That doesn't mean it's going to be necessarily higher than the first quarter. It doesn't mean that it's going to be lower than the first quarter.\nRobert Reilly: No comment on the magnitude, but the fluidity of where we are.\nWilliam Demchak: Yes. So, trying to give you some precise science with all of these unknowns out there, I just -- I don't think it\u2019s a useful exercise. What I did think was useful; simply make it as ugly as we can make it and show that we are still highly liquid and at that point, 150 basis points over the regulatory minimum. So we can operate in this environment.\nRobert Reilly: And that's the primary point.\nErika Najarian: Understood. And the follow-up question is probably equally unanswerable. But as I -- this is our first recession, obviously, in a CECL construct. And many management teams have noted that CECL is pro cyclical by nature. And I'm wondering if, again, we could have some sort of guardrails in terms of where reserve to loans could build to?And I guess, the big investor question is that, given the amount of PP&R strengths and capital levels banks have, there seems to be an opportunity to anticipate the future provisions ahead of when charge-offs are recognized. So, is there something in the -- in CECL that would allow you to recognize those ahead of charge-offs and perhaps when the charge-offs actually hit the draw on your precision costs won't be as painful.\nWilliam Demchak: Let me -- yes, so that's a CECL 101 question. I mean basically, CECL itself in its perfect form, if our economic predictions were correct, today, our reserve would cover the entire portfolio as it runs down, including charge-offs. And any change in provision would be -- would come from the rundown of the portfolio, upgrades and downgrades of the portfolio and then additions to the portfolio. So, CECL by its very nature is ahead of the charge offs.\nRobert Reilly: Like the loans.\nWilliam Demchak: Yes. It has those embedded in that. So again, if our assumptions were correct in the first quarter, and we think that they weren't conservative enough, but if they were, and we just quit lending, we're covered. That's what CECL is designed to do. And in theory, if that were correct, our provision would decline through here from the print in the first quarter through the rest of the year. In practice, we're saying we think the economy is worse. And therefore, the provision will be elevated beyond what we would provide for simple loan growth. And beyond that, we can't get any more exact.\nRobert Reilly: That's right. That's right.\nErika Najarian: That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning.\nRobert Reilly: Hey, good morning, John.\nWilliam Demchak: Hey, John.\nJohn Pancari: So back to your point around -- that you can't roll out incremental material addition to the reserve in 2Q. I know you just said it's tough to size it up. I guess, I'm trying to figure out, how we could think about the magnitude, like how much would the potential addition in the second quarter, how much would that have differed under your base scenario that you embedded in the first quarter provision versus that more severe scenario. Can you give us a little bit of color that way?\nWilliam Demchak: Well, versus the severely adverse we talked about by $9.5 billion, but that's not the one we expect. Versus what's happened in the economy, put it into context from what I've seen other people do, just against charge-offs. Go back to kind of basics, I think we provided for 4.2 times or something like that are charge-offs in the quarter.\nRobert Reilly: That's the ratio prior quarter, correct.\nWilliam Demchak: That's pretty similar to what everybody has done, JP was a little bit higher than that. I think \u2013 but people are kind of right around that number. Should it have been five times? Yeah, maybe. Yeah. But in context against what we know, if we were light, it's not orders of magnitude light. It's \u2013 we're suppose to have \u2013we should have been a couple of hundred million more. And again, I'm making up a number here. And by the way, a week from now, I can give you a different number and that's the final point.\nRobert Reilly: The fluidity of the situation, John, as you know, is moving so fast. So on any given day, the scenarios can change. We felt good about our estimate at March 31. It's deteriorated from then. For the second quarter, it can move around a lot over the next couple of months. And when we go to do our CECL estimates for the second quarter, we'll factor all that in.\nWilliam Demchak: Yeah. And not withstand \u2013 I actually, notwithstanding all the \u2013 all the magic that goes into the CECL models. I did gain some amount of comfort from the fact that at least for the big banks that have reported to date that the numbers are kind of similar as a function of multiples of charge-offs.\nRobert Reilly: And reserves are increasing substantially.\nWilliam Demchak: Yeah.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. Okay. All right. And then in terms of the \u2013 in terms of your loan modifications, I appreciate the color you gave us on the consumer modifications. But are you starting to see restructurings or modifications on the commercial side? And if you are, what amount or balances have you restructured on the commercial end?\nRobert Reilly: Yeah. Just \u2013 that's been slower. And as I mentioned in my comments, John, we handle that on an individual basis with customers. So there's been some of it, but nowhere near the volume on the consumer side.\nWilliam Demchak: Yeah. I think what's happening \u2013 think about it occurring with smaller commercial, small business clients. A lot of it real estate related, not surprise, where we're kind of deferring interest for 90 days or something. Much of it, when we do it as an aside, isn't actually changing the rating of the credit, so they were good credits. They've got a cash flow crunch, we're waving interest or payment or something, and it doesn't necessarily trigger an outright downgrade. So it's kind of case by case. It's building and ultimately, it's going to result in losses, and that's what we're reserved it for.\nRobert Reilly: And it's something we've got our eye on for the second quarter so, but it's nowhere near the volume of that consumer.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nRobert Reilly: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nScott Siefers: Yeah. I was hoping to ask another question on the modification. So specifically, in the $5.1 billion of consumer mode you guys have done, how does that break down between \u2013 I'm guessing, it's mostly mortgages, but among the various consumer categories, what \u2013 where are you seeing? And what \u2013 I guess, what's your sense for where that ultimately could go?\nRobert Reilly: Yeah. Right now \u2013 right now, it is 80-20 investor versus bank owned, and the vast majority of that being mortgage. The other significant category is auto, but mortgage is the largest.\nScott Siefers: Yes.\nWilliam Demchak: And the other -- I'm just looking at some numbers here. The other thing on auto is, for example, we have about $300 million in auto, where we've had morgs, but if memory serves, we -- on any given day, have half of that in the normal course.\nScott Siefers: Yeah.\nWilliam Demchak: So some of these totals, we're close to $5 billion. A big chunk of that is kind of in the ordinary course of what you see in consumer. And to be honest with you, we struggled a little bit to break out how much of this is really COVID related versus how much of this is basic churn in the consumer book.\nRobert Reilly: But the majority is mortgage.\nScott Siefers: Yeah.\nRobert Reilly: And the majority is in investor round.\nScott Siefers: Okay, all right. Perfect. And then, one, I guess, a little more to tack, just in the in your other fees, I mean, a lot of private equity marks presumably; those aren't the kind of things that will persist. Do you guys have a sense for where that other line ends up going as we look forward?\nRobert Reilly: Well, that's why, for the second quarter, at least, I combined other with fee income, and we have the total being down 15% to 20%. So that's not about as precise as I can get.\nScott Siefers: Yeah.\nRobert Reilly: Hopefully, we won't see the private equity valuation marks that we saw in the first quarter, but who knows.\nScott Siefers: Yeah, exactly okay. Sounds perfect, thank you guys very much.\nRobert Reilly: Sure.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead.\nBill Carcache: Hi. Good morning. Bill and Rob, I had a clarification question on your CECL methodology comments. It sounds like you're basing the allowance on economic forecasts available through 331.And to the extent there was deterioration in the outlook as we got into early April with expectations for unemployment and GDP growth further deteriorating, you would not be factoring in that incremental deterioration of 331 allowances even though that deterioration arguably existed at the balance sheet date because you didn't find out about it until April. Is that right?\nWilliam Demchak: No, because the thing that changed the most, right, was the shock that the market had on unemployment claims, the two weeks in a row where they kind of went 6 million a week, that was close to close. So that's the biggest change we saw.The other thing that's impacting how we think of this, the GDP decline is probably right. The unemployment decline we need to think through how to model correctly because of the amount of government dollars that are going into unemployed pockets.So the normal impact you'd see from the spike in unemployment that would drive GDP further down doesn't feel right. And it's more than you want to know, but that's what we have to sort of model.\nRobert Reilly: And that's a challenge for us in the second quarter, that's for sure.\nWilliam Demchak: Yeah, as we go to the second quarter.\nBill Carcache: I guess I was just trying to see if there's any implication that as long as the delta and expectations were to continue to deteriorate post balance sheet dates as we go forward from here?Whether we can expect there to be incremental reserve building continuing, even though CECL in theory should already be capturing lifetime losses, setting aside, of course, any growth that you have.\nWilliam Demchak: But the basic notion is that, that reserve gets marked to your best expect of economic outcome when you close the books.\nRobert Reilly: Which is what we do.\nWilliam Demchak: Which is what we did and what we will do.\nRobert Reilly: Okay.\nWilliam Demchak: And what we're saying -- all we're saying today is all else equal, what I know now a couple of weeks post is the economy is a little bit worse than what we assume we close the books, and we'll capture that in the second quarter.\nRobert Reilly: Yeah, we're mindful of that.\nWilliam Demchak: And if we get it right in the second quarter, then there wouldn't be any more build in the third quarter. And it's as simple as that. We're not trying to -- don't confuse that with orders of magnitude. To my point, I mean, things could get horrific, and we've shown you the horrific number.\nRobert Reilly: Yeah. And the only thing that I would add to that is, and you know it, Bill, it's just the fluidity of all this. It moves fast daily, and we'll continue to monitor it and build it into our scenarios.\nBill Carcache: Got it. Thanks, Rob. That's helpful.\nRobert Reilly: Yeah.\nBill Carcache: And Bill, if I may, just one last follow-up on the, I guess, the fee income growth opportunity in the period leading up to the great recession, you guys did out for slowing loan growth and stepping on the gas to grow fee income, the fee income side of the business. As we look back to this recession several years from now, what do you think will stand out about the way that P&C handled itself both in the period leading up to and during the recession?\nWilliam Demchak: Well, I think without question, our loan book is going to stand out. We've said this forever. We haven't changed our credit box. We're going to have losses, but there are going to be losses that you would otherwise expect for the way we talk about our credit. And I think in an environment like this, I always say, the cost of goods sold actually becomes known.\nRobert Reilly: Yes. Right.\nWilliam Demchak: So I think that stands out. I think our willingness to extend capital intelligently to clients is going to stand out as it did in the crisis. We have an opportunity to grow good clients and support existing clients with our liquidity and capital and we are going to do that.We do have, as you know, some very stable fees in particular, our treasury management business, which is doing fantastically well and is very stable and will support us through this. We have for the quarter and probably for the next quarter or so, our capital markets activity has been very strong.So I think we're in a really good position. And we sit as a management team here, working tirelessly to support our clients and with mixed emotions in the sense that this is the environment we run our company for, right? Our company is built around being able to support people and grow when everybody else falters.\nBill Carcache: That's super helpful. Thanks, Bill. Thanks Bill, Rob. That's super helpful.\nRobert Reilly: Yes. Yes. Thanks, Bill.\nOperator: There are no further questions.\nRobert Reilly: Okay.\nWilliam Demchak: All right. Well, thank you, everybody. Stay safe.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "William Demchak",
            "content": "Thanks Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you've seen this morning, our results for the quarter were solid on a pre-provision basis, but the extraordinary changes in the economic backdrop occurring in March and the implications of the broad-based response to the COVID-19 breakout had a material impact on our provision for credit losses.Before we go into the financials, I want to acknowledge the current environment. Obviously, this pandemic is having a profound impact on the global economy and on people's lives and the challenges we face as a country are unprecedented. PNC through this period is navigating these challenges from a position of strength.We have nearly 52,000 employees who are working incredibly hard to serve our customers. We immediately mobilized to mitigate the risks to our frontline employees and implemented enhanced pay provisions for those in roles that can't be performed remotely.Our technology, in which we've invested heavily over time, allowed us to quickly transition to a remote work model for more than 30,000 of our employees, including those from our call center who are managing a very high call volume from the safety of their homes. Our technology also allowed us to quickly prepare for and respond to the federal government's economic stimulus package, which we are supporting through loans and other relief to consumer and business customers.As an aside, since launching our online paycheck protection program portal on April 3, we've received over 75,000 applications. And we have thousands of people working tirelessly to process these loan requests in accordance with the SBA's requirements, including documentation and have registered at this point, actually as of this morning, something over $6 billion worth of these loans.Also, the convenience and security of our mobile and online banking tools are allowing us to continue to provide critical banking services with minimal disruption. Despite the current economic challenges, we are confident in our ability to continue to withstand strong environmental headwinds. We have solid liquidity and capital positions. We grew loans by $25 billion and deposits by $17 billion compared to the end of the fourth quarter.While this was largely driven by draws on commercial lines of credit, as Rob's going to take you through, we have provided new loans to support key industries in our country since the COVID outbreak, including over $2 billion in new loans to hospitals and other health care entities and $1 billion in new loans to municipalities.As in the side, over the last few weeks and into April, we've seen the rate of loan draws normalize. In addition, we've seen a meaningful increase in deposits, with the growth in dollars now equal to the loan growth since the outbreak of COVID-19. We're processing thousands of forbearance and loan modification requests for consumers.Today, consumer modifications, we've had 41,000 processed \u2013 sorry, as of April 12. Importantly, of the 41,000, 20,000 of these are bank owned, with the remainder being for loans that we service for others. This may be the greatest challenge that many in our country have ever experienced. Many of our clients are experiencing financial hardship and despite their uncertainties, our commitment to them is as certain as it has ever been.Now, our results for the first quarter are shown on slide 4. And while pre-provision earnings increased 7%, the provision for credit losses of $914 million increased $693 million, reflecting the new CECL standard. While we developed our economic scenario to account for COVID-19, I want to say that, the economy has worsened since we closed the books on these numbers.Now, Rob will provide insight on how our scenarios have been impacted by some developments and how we would fare if the situation was to become more severe. In that instance, we would still be well capitalized, highly liquid and be able to maintain our dividend, while complying with capital standardsRob is going to take you through the income statement, but one thing I wanted to point out inside of our non-interest income as our security gains, which were higher than usual this quarter. And we realized these gains by taking advantage of some of the disruption in the fixed income markets that occurred before the Fed stepped in. And we still managed to increase our book yield on securities quarter-over-quarter. So if you think about it, normally, you sell securities and you replace them in your book yield goes down. In this instance, we actually increased our book yield and securities.Before I turn it over to Rob, I want to recognize and thank our employees, who are going above and beyond every day to help our customers address the many challenges that they are facing. Additionally, our regional presidents together with a PNC Foundation are playing a critical role and upholding our commitment to the communities we serve by allocating critical funds to coronavirus relief efforts across our markets.And with that \u2013 with that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our first quarter results, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Well, just on cumulative losses, the scenario we ran and jump in here where you want, Rob, basically had us coming up with losses of $10 billion in 2020, whereas the severe -- the severely adverse in CCAR had roughly $10 billion over the nine quarters. It's much worse. Maybe that's a simple soundbite to it. And the peak to trough, what do we do on GDP? Versus 8% on... 8.5 adverse. Yeah. That's an unanswerable question. So what we tried to do was barbell it for you. We would tell you and I had this in my script that since we closed the books, we saw claims be higher than we had assumed. We changed from thinking that a V-shaped recovery was going to happen fast into more of a U-shaped recovery.

            "content": "Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on slide 5 and is presented on a spot basis. While we typically cover our average balance sheet, we're going to focus on our spot balances this quarter due to the substantial increased activity late in the quarter related to the economic impact of COVID-19.On the asset side, loan balances of $265 billion at March 31, were up $25 billion, or 10% compared to December 31, 2019. This growth reflected an increase in commercial loan balances of approximately $24 billion, primarily driven by higher utilization of loan commitments.Investment securities of $91 billion increased $3.7 billion, or 4% linked quarter. Also, our cash balances at the Federal Reserve as of March 31, 2020, were $20 billion, down $3.6 billion from year-end, in part due to the benefits from the regulatory tailoring rules on our liquidity effective January 1, 2020.On the liability side, deposit balances of $305 billion at March 31, were up $17 billion or 6% compared to December 31, 2019. A high proportion of the commercial loan draws were placed back with us in the form of deposits. And as a result, non-interest-bearing deposits grew $8.8 billion or 12% linked quarter. Total borrowed funds increased $13 billion due to higher FHLB borrowings, and increased debt issuance activity during the quarter.As of March 31, 2020, our Basel III Common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated to be 9.4%, which reflected the impact of the tailoring rules, including our decision to opt out of AOCI, as well as our election to phase in CECL's impact on our estimated regulatory capital.While our capital ratios remained strong, on March 16, 2020, we announced the temporary suspension of our common stock repurchase program in conjunction with the Federal Reserve's effort to support the U.S. economy during this time. It did not impact PNC's dividend policy.Our tangible book value was $84.93 per common share as of March 31, an increase of 9% compared to a year ago. Our loan-to-deposit ratio was 87% at March 31st. And importantly, our liquidity coverage ratio exceeded the regulatory minimum requirement.As you can see on Slide 6, commercial loan and funded commitments declined by approximately $16 billion, as customers grew down lines to bolster their liquidity or replace alternative funding channels. As a result, our utilization rate increased from 55% to 61%.The drawdowns we've experienced are diversified across industries, and more than two-thirds of the increased utilization is from investment-grade borrowers. While drawdowns were well above normal in mid-March, we saw activity begin to slow at the end of the quarter and that's remained the case so far during the second quarter.That said we do expect loan balances to be elevated for some time. Importantly, PNC is well positioned with strong capital and liquidity. And we're committed to putting our resources to work to support our customers and the broader financial system at this critical time.As you can see on the slide, as of March 31, we had approximately $140 billion of readily available liquidity from diverse sources. These sources, along with substantially more availability from the Fed discount window, should it be necessary, provide ample funding to meet the potential needs of our customers.Turning to Slide 7, we're working to provide relief and flexibility to our customers through a variety of solutions during this time. On the commercial side, we're offering emergency relief for small and medium-sized business loans, including those being provided through the federally enacted Cares Act.We have received thousands of applications through the Paycheck protection program and have begun to fund those loans successfully, as Bill just mentioned. Additionally, we're granting loan modifications to commercial clients, primarily in the form of principal and/or interest deferrals.We're analyzing and making decisions on these modifications based on each individual borrower situation. With our consumer customers, we're also granting loan modifications through extensions, deferrals and forbearance.As of April 13, we have completed over 41,000 consumer loan modifications, primarily related to COVID-19. And in addition, we're offering relief in the form of extended grace periods and halting all foreclosures, while waiving certain fees and charges.As you can see on Slide 8, first quarter total revenue was $4.5 billion, down $92 million linked quarter or 2%. Net interest income of $2.5 billion was up $23 million or 1%. And compared to the fourth quarter, as lower funding costs as well as higher loan and security balances were partially offset by lower loan yields and one less day in the quarter.Our net interest margin increased to 2.84%, up 6 basis points linked quarter, in large part due to lower rates paid on deposits. Non-interest income declined $115 million or 5% linked quarter, reflecting stable fee revenue that was offset by, lower other non-interest income.Non-interest expense declined $219 million or 8% compared to the fourth quarter with all categories essentially flat to down. Our efficiency ratio was 56% in the first quarter, improving from 60% in the previous quarter. Provision for credit losses in the first quarter was $914 million, reflecting the adoption of the CECL methodology, including the economic effects of COVID-19 and loan growth. And our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 13.7%.In light of the current economic circumstances related to COVID-19, naturally we're evaluating and monitoring our entire loan portfolio. However, we believe the industry sector is likely to be most impacted are on slide 9.Our outstanding loan balances as of March 31 to these industries are $19.3 billion and represents 7% of our total loan portfolio. Corporate loan balances in these industries totaled $10.6 billion. Within this group, we're most focused on our exposures to retail, restaurants and certain parts of leisure travel. In retail, total loans outstanding are $2.5 billion, 60% of which are asset based. Restaurant loan outstandings are $1.2 billion and cruise lines and commercial airlines together total less than $600 million.In our commercial real estate portfolio, we have $8.7 billion in outstanding in areas most likely to be impacted by COVID-19. This includes CRE properties of $5.1 billion, 60% of which are stabilized and 40% under construction, all with a portfolio LTV of 55%. The remaining $3.5 billion of exposure is to REIT approximately two-thirds of which are investment grade.Turning to slide 10. This is an update on our oil and gas portfolio given the continued pressures on the energy industry. At the end of the first quarter, we had total outstandings of $4.6 billion in oil and gas loans, or just less than 2% of our total outstanding loans. We last updated you on this portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2016, while we were relatively pleased with the performance of this portfolio through the last oil and gas downturn of 2016, especially with respect to reserve-based lending structures.Accordingly, the growth in our portfolio since 2016 has been primarily in the upstream segment, which carry these structures as well as the midstream segments, which tend to perform relatively well under stress. Nearly all of our losses from the 2016 downturn occurred in our services book, which has declined as a percentage of total loans from the fourth quarter of 2016 and notably, approximately $900 million or 74% of the $1.2 billion of this sector is asset based. We will continue to monitor market conditions and actively manage our energy portfolio.Our credit quality metrics are presented on Slide 11. Net charge-offs for loans and leases were stable with the fourth quarter, increasing slightly by $3 million. Annualized net charge-offs to total loans was also stable with the fourth quarter at 35 basis points.Non-performing loans increased $9 million or 1% compared to December 31, 2019, and total delinquencies declined $21 million linked quarter or 1%. The ratios for both non-performing loans to total loans and delinquencies to total loans decreased in the quarter.As you can see, our provision for first quarter 2020 increased substantially to $914 million, reflecting the adoption of the CECL methodology, including the economic effects of COVID-19 and loan growth. Since the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, we've increased our reserves by approximately $1.3 billion. As a result, at March 31, our allowance for credit losses, including unfunded balances to total loans was 1.66%, and our allowance to non-performing loans was 240%.Slide 12 shows the drivers of the increase to our allowance for credit losses and ultimately our provision under CECL. Our attribution shows the increase in reserves for the CECL day one transition adjustment of $642 million, as well as portfolio changes and economic factors.Portfolio changes represent the impact of shifts in loan balances, age and mix as well as credit quality and net charge-off activity. These factors accounted for $196 million of the change in our reserves for the first quarter of 2020.Economic factors represent our evaluation and determination of an economic forecast applied to our loan portfolios. To accomplish this, we use a three-year reasonable and supportable forecast period and a weighted average of four different economic scenarios at quarter end.Importantly, each of these scenarios, were designed to address at the time the emerging COVID-19 crisis. This approach provided a blended scenario as of March 31, which when compared to the scenarios used for our transition calculation, resulted in an increase in reserves of $496 million for the first quarter.For this blended approach, we used a number of economic variables with the largest driver being GDP. In this scenario, annualized GDP contracted 11.2% in the second quarter of 2020 and finishes the year down 2.3% with recovery of the pre recession peak levels occurring by the fourth quarter of 2021.Since the end of the first quarter, when we finalized our CECL estimate, the macroeconomic backdrop has worsened, suggesting a deeper decline in GDP and other economic factors than what our March 31 scenario contemplated.Should these macroeconomic factors persist, we'll adjust our blended scenario accordingly, which would likely result in a material build to our reserves during the second quarter.Additionally, for our own stress informational purposes, we consider our most extreme adverse scenario in isolation to determine a hypothetical year-end 2020 capital and liquidity impact.This scenario is even more severe than the 2020 CCAR severely adverse scenario. It assumes a 30% annualized contraction in GDP in the second quarter of 2020, followed by another 20% annualized contraction in the third quarter, leading to a peak to trough decline of 14%. This compares to the CCAR severely adverse scenario, peak to trough decline of 8.5%.To be clear, this scenario is not our expectation nor does this exercise attempt to capture all the potential unknown variables that would likely arise, but simply provides an approximation of outcome under these circumstances. This results in an approximately 8.5% CET1 ratio at year-end 2020, and we believe would allow us to continue to support our current dividend.In summary, looking at the remainder of the year, we expect a challenging environment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect a significant contraction in GDP and we expect the Fed funds rate to remain in its current range of zero to 25 basis points throughout 2020.Clearly, the biggest variables impacting the economy will be the length of the crisis and the efficacy of the massive U.S. government support and stimulus programs. While we're hopeful the duration will be short and the government programs prove highly effective, at this time, we naturally have no way of knowing these outcomes.Accordingly, our visibility is low. However, based on what we think now, we can provide a second quarter guidance and some directional thoughts for the full year.For the second quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2020, we expect growth in average loans to be in the high-single-digit range as a result of the increased spot level at quarter end as well as additional anticipated funding needs of our commercial and consumer customers.We expect NII to be stable. We expect total noninterest income to be down approximately 15% to 20%, mostly reflecting the elevated MSRs and security gains that we generated amidst the volatility during the first quarter. We also expect some general softening in fee categories as well, particularly service charges on deposits, while we continue to weigh fees for our customers during this crisis.We expect total non-interest expense to be flat to down. And in regard to net charge-offs, we expect second quarter levels to be between $250 million and $350 million, up quarter-over-quarter as we begin to experience the economic effects of the crisis. For the full year and for the reasons previously stated, our visibility is substantially limited. But with that in mind, we now expect both full year revenue and non-interest expense to each be down between 5% and 10%.And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions. Good morning, Erika. And... Yes. Erika, that's exactly right. So it's more severe in the sense that we front end those losses into the next nine months whereas CCAR and DFAST contemplated that over nine quarters. About 14% 8.5, yes, That's right. So much sharper and faster. No comment on the magnitude, but the fluidity of where we are. And that's the primary point. Like the loans. That's right. That's right. Hey, good morning, John. That's the ratio prior quarter, correct. The fluidity of the situation, John, as you know, is moving so fast. So on any given day, the scenarios can change. We felt good about our estimate at March 31. It's deteriorated from then. For the second quarter, it can move around a lot over the next couple of months. And when we go to do our CECL estimates for the second quarter, we'll factor all that in. And reserves are increasing substantially. Yeah. Just \u2013 that's been slower. And as I mentioned in my comments, John, we handle that on an individual basis with customers. So there's been some of it, but nowhere near the volume on the consumer side. And it's something we've got our eye on for the second quarter so, but it's nowhere near the volume of that consumer. Sure. Yeah. Right now \u2013 right now, it is 80-20 investor versus bank owned, and the vast majority of that being mortgage. The other significant category is auto, but mortgage is the largest. But the majority is mortgage. And the majority is in investor round. Well, that's why, for the second quarter, at least, I combined other with fee income, and we have the total being down 15% to 20%. So that's not about as precise as I can get. Hopefully, we won't see the private equity valuation marks that we saw in the first quarter, but who knows. Sure. And that's a challenge for us in the second quarter, that's for sure. Which is what we do. Okay. Yeah, we're mindful of that. Yeah. And the only thing that I would add to that is, and you know it, Bill, it's just the fluidity of all this. It moves fast daily, and we'll continue to monitor it and build it into our scenarios. Yeah. Yes. Right. Yes. Yes. Thanks, Bill. Okay."

Participating on this call are PNC\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today\u2019s earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These materials are all available on our corporate website pnc.com under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of January 18, 2022 and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Demchak: Thanks, Brian and good morning everybody. As you\u2019ve seen, we had a strong fourth quarter and full year for 2021. We successfully completed the conversion of BBVA USA early in the fourth quarter and have been running hard as one bank since then. The transaction continues to meet or exceed our deal projections and Rob will give you some of those details. I am especially pleased by our ability to announce, close and convert a transaction of this size inside of 11 months. Challenges notwithstanding, we had the talent, the technology and the strategy to accomplish this and to combine our organization in a way that will provide growth opportunities for years to come. The acquisition positions us with a coast-to-coast presence and along with our continued organic growth strategies, including our recent expansion into Las Vegas, we now have a presence in all of the top 30 U.S. markets. We are excited about the opportunity this presents and we are confident in our ability to generate growth by executing on our Main Street relationship-based model. That said, we recognized that we have a lot of work to do in building out the new and expansion markets, which will be our primary focus in 2022. BBVA obviously impacted our results for the full year and Rob will walk you through the details. Excluding BBVA, we generated record revenue, highlighted by strong non-interest income with broad-based contributions across our commercial and consumer businesses. We also maintained outstanding credit quality and a very strong capital position. While we continue to opportunistically deploy some of our excess cash into higher yielding securities throughout the year, we remain well-positioned with substantial excess liquidity to capitalize on a rising interest rate environment. Our reported results for the fourth quarter reflected the impact of almost $440 million of BBVA integration costs. Excluding these, we generated nearly $1.6 billion of net income and solid returns. Importantly, excluding the impact of PPP loan forgiveness, we saw decent underlying loan growth trends and some uptick in utilization rates, which is very encouraging, as Rob will discuss in more detail. Critical to our long-term success has been the quality and stability of our talent and we pride ourselves of being an employer of choice, given the recent dynamics of the substantially increased competition for talent. In part due to the great resignation, we experienced greater wage pressure during the fourth quarter and I expect that to persist into the coming year. Naturally, we will look to offset these increases with our continuous improvement efforts, which include driving further automation and rethinking core processes. We continue to invest in technology to enhance our capabilities in an increasingly digital world. Customers are looking to their financial providers to offer innovative tools that help them manage their money in ways that are faster, smarter and more convenient, whether that be expanded use cases for Zelle, where transaction volumes are up 50% or low cash mode. For example, by providing account transparency and control, low cash mode has substantially reduced customer overdraft fees and related complaints. I will close by thanking our employees for their hard work and steadfast commitment to our customers and communities. Because of our employees, we had a remarkable year and are well-positioned to serve all of our stakeholders in 2022 and beyond. And with that, I will turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our results and then we\u2019ll take your questions.\nRob Reilly: Thanks, Bill and good morning everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 5 and is presented on an average basis. Overall, year-over-year balance sheet growth was primarily driven by the acquisition of BBVA USA. Loans grew 18%, investment securities increased 49%, and deposits grew 26%. Looking at the linked quarter changes, loans for the fourth quarter were $289 billion, a decline of $2.4 billion or 1%. Excluding $4.7 billion of PPP forgiveness activity, loans grew $2.3 billion or 1% and I will cover the drivers in more detail over the next few slides. Investment securities increased $7 billion or 6% as we maintained higher purchasing activity throughout much of the quarter. Accordingly, cash balances at the Federal Reserve declined by $5 billion. On the liability side, deposit balances declined $1.6 billion as higher commercial and consumer deposits were offset by runoff deposits related to the strategic repricing of certain BBVA USA portfolios during the third quarter and that negatively impacted fourth quarter average balances. However, on a spot basis, total deposits as of December 31 increased $8 billion or 2%, reflecting the continued strong liquidity positions of our customers. At year end, our tangible book value was $94.11 per common share and our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 10.2%, which are both substantially above the pro forma levels we anticipated when we announced the deal. During the quarter, we returned approximately $1.1 billion of capital to shareholders via common dividends of $500 million and share repurchases of $600 million. Given our strong capital ratios, we continue to be well-positioned with significant capital flexibility going forward. Slide 6 shows our average loans and deposits in more detail. In the fourth quarter, loans declined $2.4 billion as growth in commercial and consumer loans was more than offset by a decline in PPP loans of $4.7 billion. Excluding the impact of PPP, commercial loans grew by $2.2 billion or 1%, driven by growth in corporate banking and asset-based lending. During the fourth quarter, we continue to see a slow and steady increase in utilization rates within our corporate and institutional banking business and along with that expanded pipelines. Taken together, these factors are driving our expectations for higher loan growth in 2022. Consumer loans increased modestly linked quarter as higher residential real estate balances were mostly offset by lower home equity and auto loans. Finally, as I mentioned, PPP loans continued to decline due to forgiveness activity. And as of December 31, $3.4 billion of PPP loans remained on our balance sheet. Average deposits of $453 billion declined by $1.6 billion linked quarter for the reasons I previously mentioned. Overall, our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits remained stable at 4 basis points. Slide 7 details the change in our average securities and Federal Reserve balances. As rates increased at the end of the third quarter and throughout the fourth quarter, we continue to opportunistically add securities to our portfolio, primarily U.S. treasuries. As a result, securities balances averaged $128 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of $7.2 billion or 6% compared to the third quarter of 2021 and now represent 26% of interest-earning assets. We continue to have substantial excess liquidity with Fed cash balances averaging $75 billion during the fourth quarter, which we believe positions us well for a rising rate environment. As you can see on Slide 8, fourth quarter 2021 reported EPS was $2.86, which included pre-tax integration costs of $438 million. Excluding integration costs, adjusted EPS was $3.68. As expected, during the fourth quarter, we incurred essentially half of our total anticipated deal integration costs, which reduced revenue by $47 million and increased expenses by $391 million. Since the announcement of the acquisition, we have now incurred approximately 95% of the total $980 million expected integration costs, including $120 million of write-offs for capitalized items. Excluding the impact of integration costs, linked quarter revenue was down $31 million or 1%. Expenses increased $48 million or 1% and pre-tax pre-provision earnings declined $79 million or 4%. The fourth quarter provision recapture was $327 million, reflecting continued improvements in the economic environment. Net income, excluding pre-tax integration costs of $438 million, was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter. Now, let\u2019s discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to Slide 9, these charts illustrate our diversified business mix. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of $5.1 billion decreased $70 million linked quarter, reflecting lower non-interest income. Net interest income of $2.9 billion, was up slightly, primarily a result of higher securities balances. Net interest margin was stable at 2.27%. As I mentioned, integration costs reduced non-interest income by $47 million, which included $19 million of lease exit costs, $17 million of treasury management fee waivers, and $11 million of overdraft waivers. Fourth quarter fee income, excluding integration costs, was $1.9 billion and declined $39 million or 2% linked quarter. Looking at the detail, asset management fees increased $3 million or 1%, primarily related to higher average equity markets. Consumer services grew $12 million or 2% due to higher brokerage and credit card revenue. Corporate service fees increased $14 million or 2%, reflecting higher loan syndications activity as well as continued elevated corporate advisory activity. Residential mortgage non-interest income declined $46 million driven by lower RMSR valuation adjustments and loan sales revenue. Service charges on deposits decreased $22 million, primarily a result of converting BBVA USA customers to PNC\u2019s product and overdraft pricing structure. Other non-interest income, excluding integration costs, was stable linked quarter as the impact of a $1 million positive Visa derivative fair value adjustment in the fourth quarter compared to a negative adjustment of $169 million in the third quarter was offset by lower private equity revenue. Turning to Slide 10, our fourth quarter expenses were up by $204 million or 6% linked quarter. The growth was primarily driven by $156 million increase in integration expenses. Excluding the impact of integration expenses of $391 million, non-interest expense increased $48 million or 1%. The growth was largely within personnel costs driven by higher employee benefits expense, an increase in our minimum hourly rate of pay as well as elevated incentive compensation related to strong fee activity. We had a 2021 goal of $300 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program, and we successfully completed actions to achieve that goal. Looking forward to 2022, our annual CIP goal will once again be $300 million. Importantly, as of year end 2021, we completed all of the actions that will drive $900 million of savings related to the BBVA USA acquisition, which we expect to be fully realized in 2022 and is reflected in our expense guidance that I will provide in a few minutes. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 11. Non-performing loans of $2.5 billion decreased $48 million or 2% compared to September 30 and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies of $2 billion on December 31 increased $516 million or 35%. Obviously, this was a large increase, but it was primarily driven by BBDA USA conversion-related administrative and operational delays, which we expect will largely be resolved within the first half of 2022. Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $124 million, an increase of $43 million linked quarter. Commercial net charge-offs declined $5 million, offset by an increase of $48 million in consumer. Inside of the higher consumer net charge-offs, auto grew $28 million and other consumer increased $13 million, reflecting conversion-related impacts as well as seasonality. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans continues to be low and in the fourth quarter was 17 basis points. And during the fourth quarter, our allowance for credit losses declined $471 million, reflecting continued improvements in the economic environment. At quarter end, our reserves were $5.5 billion, representing 1.92% of loans. In summary, PNC reported a strong fourth quarter, which concluded a successful 2021 and we are well positioned for 2022 as we continue to realize the potential of our coast-to-coast franchise. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we expect strong growth over the course of 2022, resulting in 3.5% GDP growth. We also expect 425 basis point increases in the Fed Funds rate in 2022, beginning in May, followed by additional increases in June, September and December. Looking ahead, our full year guidance for 2022 includes the impact of 12 months of BBVA USA results compared to only 7 months in 2021. Taking that into account our outlook for full year 2022 compared to 2021 results is as follows. We expect average loan growth of approximately 10% and 5% on a spot basis. We expect total revenue growth to be 8% to 10%. We expect expenses, excluding integration expense to be up 4% to 6%. And to be clear here, this includes 5 additional months of BBVA USA operating expenses, which equates to a full year increase of approximately $500 million and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. Based on this guidance, we expect we will generate solid positive operating leverage in 2022. Looking ahead at the first quarter of 2022 compared to the recent fourth quarter 2021 results, we expect average loan balances, excluding PPP, to be up approximately 1% to 2%. We expect NII to be down approximately 1% to 2%, reflecting 2 fewer days in the quarter and a decline of approximately $75 million in PPP-related interest income. We expect fee income to be down 4% to 6% due to seasonally lower first quarter client activity as well as elevated fourth quarter fees in certain categories. We expect other non-interest income to be between $375 million and $425 million, excluding integration costs as well as net securities and these activities. Taking our guidance for all components of revenue into consideration, we expect total revenue to decline approximately 3% to 5%. We expect total non-interest expense excluding integration costs, to be down approximately 4% to 6%. And during the quarter, we expect to incur $30 million of integration expense. Finally, we expect first quarter net charge-offs to be between $100 million and $150 million. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from the line of Dave George with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nDave George: Hey, guys. Good morning. I had a question about capital and capital allocation. You obviously finished the year at 10.2% CET1, which is ahead of kind of your initial targets when you announced BBVA. And your stock is at $2.3, $2.4 of tangible book, and I know you\u2019ve talked about taking the cash dividend payout up. So just kind of curious, Bill, how you\u2019re thinking about capital allocation in the new year? And then I\u2019ve got one follow-up.\nBill Demchak: Well, you kind of answered your own question because we\u2019re consistent. All else equal in this environment first focus on the potential of loan growth and using it a good way, a bias, strong bias towards dividend, but we will still be in the market to repurchase shares. And I think you\u2019ll probably see us accelerate some of the things we\u2019re doing on the smaller side in terms of product activity bolt-ons into TM and so forth. None of that \u2013 by the way, those acquisitions won\u2019t add up too much, but they have become an important part of just adding core capabilities as we go into a digitized world.\nDave George: Okay. Thanks for the. And then a question on your guidance, in particular, NII, I know you mentioned you\u2019ve got four hikes in there. I assume you\u2019re using the forward curve and the securities as a percentage of earning assets, up to 26%. I know, Bill, you\u2019ve talked about being 25% to 30%. Do you expect continued liquidity deployment, just kind of curious how much liquidity deployment is embedded in that number? Thanks.\nBill Demchak: So our economist expects for hikes. I actually think it\u2019s going to be more aggressive than that, but I\u2019m an outlier in our committee, and we....\nRob Reilly: The only one vote. Yes.\nBill Demchak: And our forecast is at this point, pretty much on the forward curve at this point. I think the plan, Rob, I don\u2019t know if you want to talk to the plan of we\u2019re going to gradually add duration throughout the year. There wasn\u2019t any magic to it, and we didn\u2019t really build in, in Rob\u2019s guidance some assumption that we would go at it even more aggressively for each reacted.\nRob Reilly: In the range that we have that 25% to 30% range date still the range that\u2019s in our guidance.\nBill Demchak: Yes.\nDave George: Okay, thanks. Appreciate it.\nBill Demchak: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. And up next, we now have a question from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning, guys.\nRob Reilly: Hi. Good morning, John.\nJohn Pancari: On the revenue guide for the full year of 8% to 10%, I just wanted to see if you could help unpack that a little bit in terms of how you view the NII trajectory for the year and whatever of growth we think is reasonable versus the trajectory on the fee income side of things, given some of the dynamics you flagged? Thanks.\nRob Reilly: Yes, sure, John. So full revenue \u2013 full year revenue up 8% to 10%, break down those components, net interest income up low teens. And that does that does factor in the rate increases that we spoke about in the comments \u2013 opening comments and then on the fees, mid-single digits year-over-year. So, those two together get you to the 8% to 10%.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. All right. Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. And then on the loan growth front, just given the 10% end of period loan growth expectations certainly implies an acceleration that you indicated that you\u2019re seeing, could you give us a little more color on the growth trends that you think is achievable on the commercial side versus consumer? And maybe what are you expecting to be the biggest drivers of that acceleration as you look at the loan book?\nRob Reilly: Yes, sure. So for the full year guide, it\u2019s 10% average, but probably a better indicator is the spot just because of the acquisition dynamics on the average number. So, spot up from period end 5%. And we see a continuation of what we started to see in the fourth quarter, which was some expanded utilization in the commercial book, picking up through 2022. And then a little bit less on the consumer side. Consumer customers are still pretty flush with cash. So loan demand there, certainly in the first half of 2022, we expect to be softer than the commercial side.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. That helps, thanks. Yes, I meant to say average on the growth.\nRob Reilly: Yes. Yes.\nJohn Pancari: Alright. I appreciate the color. Thanks.\nRob Reilly: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. And now we have a question from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nErika Najarian: Hi. Good morning.\nBill Demchak: Good morning, Erika.\nErika Najarian: Wanted to follow-up on the questions on what\u2019s embedded in the NII guide. Rob, you answered the question on what you\u2019re assuming for liquidity deployment. But what are you assuming in your NII guide about the trajectory of deposit beta? And what do you think will actually happen?\nRob Reilly: Well, in terms of our guidance, Erika, what we apply in terms of beta is what we\u2019ve seen in past cycles, which, generally speaking, will be a lag on the front end. So my expectation and what we built into the guidance is that we will see some beta increase, but not until the end of 2022 and it will probably be more of a factor in \u201823. Just because of the levels of liquidity and deposits that we have.\nErika Najarian: Got it. Okay. So if I\u2019m comparing it to your previous deposit beta, in terms of, let\u2019s say, in \u201815 to \u201816 to \u201817, actually, the first 100 basis points, your guidance assumes a slower ramp than that.\nRob Reilly: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s exactly right.\nErika Najarian: Got it. And the second follow-up question is for Bill. One of your peers, Jamie, had obviously given a guidance for higher expenses in 2022, pointing to accelerated investment spend. As we think about this 4% to 6%, obviously, some of this is the BBVA baseline. But did you front-load some of the investment spend in 2022? In other words, as your investors start thinking about P&C\u2019s profitability in a more \u2013 in a normalized rising rate environment, is 4% to 6% an appropriate guidepost for future growth in expenses going past \u201822?\nBill Demchak: No. No. So to unpack the guide for next year, the \u2013 I think the P&C legacy expenses are up maybe 1%.\nRob Reilly: The non-BBD USA. Yes.\nBill Demchak: Yes. Yes. And so did we prepack investment? We\u2019ve said all along that we\u2019ve had a steady state and actually a fairly high level of investment in our core business. And then you\u2019ll remember in the guidance for BBVA that in the $900 million of cost saves, that was a netted number against investments we are going to make to build out those markets. So inside of everything you\u2019re seeing there actually has a lot of investment already built into it.\nRob Reilly: And of course, our continuous improvement of $300 million offset investments. And that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been doing for a number of years.\nErika Najarian: Got it.\nBill Demchak: I also think \u2013 we\u2019ve had \u2013 it\u2019s worth noting, we\u2019ve had some debate internally on the continuous improvement number and can it be larger? Because I think we all see opportunities in the operating environment as we move forward with BBVA. The challenge is continuous improvement is something you know you can do, whereas right now, we\u2019re still in the process of we know it\u2019s there. We just don\u2019t know where yet. Once we kind of lock it down and can track it, it shows up in continuous improvement.\nRob Reilly: Yes. And that won\u2019t stop us from going after it.\nBill Demchak: Exactly.\nErika Najarian: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And we now have a question from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Good morning.\nBill Demchak: Hey, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. So two questions. One, just on how we\u2019re thinking about the reinvestment in the securities portfolio as we think about the NII guide as well? Maybe you could give us a little sense of the pace that you\u2019re thinking about reinvesting. I mean, what\u2019s baked into your NII guide because as we know, the forward curve does suggest we\u2019re going to be hitting to pretty soon. So do you wait for that? Or do you start to lag in even at current rates?\nBill Demchak: We will leg in throughout the course. But remember, what\u2019s in our guide on securities, doesn\u2019t dent our liquidity profile. So what we have in our guide here is kind of steady deployment working towards the 25% to 30% will add balances. It doesn\u2019t even dent the potential of what we could do with liquidity.\nRob Reilly: With the Fed cash balances.\nBill Demchak: Yes. Yes.\nBetsy Graseck: You are still looking for that\u2026\nBill Demchak: So it\u2019s kind of a \u2013 it\u2019s a baseline budget boring. The rates do this. We do the following. If there is if rates go beyond or even if we get to a place where we think rates have probably gone where they need to go, not as high as I think they\u2019ll go. We could increase that, but that\u2019s not contemplated in the forecast that we have right now.\nBetsy Graseck: Because am I right in thinking your target range of securities to earning assets like 25% to 30%, is that fair?\nBill Demchak: Yes.\nRob Reilly: Yes. So that\u2019s right.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. And then just a follow-up\u2026\nBill Demchak: And remember inside of that mix, right, that\u2019s a big portfolio of securities, big difference in the yield coming out of buying short-dated treasuries, which has been kind of our recent trade versus going further out the curve and going back towards mortgages once you assume the extension risk is taken out. Massive difference in yields. So it\u2019s \u2013 some of it\u2019s notional of security. Some of it\u2019s what you\u2019re actually buying and both of those will be driven by the speed and outlook for rates over time.\nBetsy Graseck: Right. So what I\u2019m hearing is baseline and the expectation, but upside as we approach kind of rates reflecting your view of full extension risk on the RMBS side.\nBill Demchak: Yes. No, if my individual view is right, there is a lot of upside. But the forecast that we\u2019ve given you and what\u2019s kind of in our plan is steady state follow the forwards and leg in over time.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay.\nRob Reilly: On simpler terms, the yields on the securities portfolio can change a lot.\nBill Demchak: Yes.\nBetsy Graseck: Right. Right. I got it. Okay. And then separately, just thinking a little bit longer term, Bill, on the investments that you\u2019re doing, could you just give us a little bit of color as to what are you looking for in these bolt-on acquisitions to enhance your digitization? What pieces of your digitization are you looking to improve? And also, is there a need for reinvestment in branches in the new geographies where maybe you would have had a slightly different skew to the branch mix, just trying to understand a little more detail there? Thanks.\nBill Demchak: Two very different questions. We \u2013 as you\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve done a number of small things, Tempus probably being the most interesting one where we bring in certain payment capabilities that lead to other opportunities. And we see more and more of those. By the way, we\u2019re not unique at that. A lot of banks are playing in the space. They are not terribly expensive, but oftentimes, you get modules of technology that can be sort of bought into and then scaled across your broader platform. So that\u2019s \u2013 I just think you\u2019re going to see more of that as we continue to compete in digital space for both the consumer and the corporate. On the branch side, we have plans to further as we always do, kind of build out selectively in the markets where we\u2019re underpenetrated. But at the same time, you\u2019ll see us continue our practice of consolidating the thicker market so no real change there and all that\u2019s in the numbers we\u2019ve given you.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And we now have a question from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead with your question.\nGerard Cassidy: Hi, Rob. Hi, Bill.\nBill Demchak: Good morning, Gerard.\nRob Reilly: Good morning.\nGerard Cassidy: Can you guys give us a little color? I\u2019m trying to figure out what we\u2019re going to be talking about in the fourth quarter earnings call for 2022 in January of \u201823. And I think credit might be a subject that receive more attention then. Can you share with us your underwriting standards, how you compare them today to, let\u2019s say, right at the start of the pandemic and then comparing them to 2019? How they look compared to today?\nBill Demchak: Well, so you got to separate something, our credit box per se, right? So the type of clients we lend to, the leverage they can have, all the things you would otherwise measure. We really don\u2019t change that over time. Having said that, of course, even inside of that box companies are doing better or they are doing \u2013 trending more poorly. I think we are going to go into a period of time here as we go towards the end of the year. We are all else equal, there will be pressure on credit, not because we changed our underwriting standards, but because of the downgrade ratio will change. Rob and I were talking before the call, if you actually look at our reserve ratio, particularly when you adjust it for credit cards, I can\u2019t think of a period of time where you are kind of going into rising rate environment, which is going to help us, loan growth, which is going to help us and feeling healthy reserves when you compare where we are versus \u2013 I will just call it that versus the rest of the industry in terms of raw percentages against balance and you know our book through legacy performance.\nRob Reilly: And resulting from the unique dynamics of the pandemic. So, it\u2019s an unusual setup.\nBill Demchak: Yes.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then as a follow-up, you have some decent loan growth, Rob that you pointed to for 2022. Within the commercial growth areas, C&I, not real estate, but C&I, can you share with us or give us some more color. Are they coming from the newer markets that you guys have entered over the last 5 years or 6 years, or are you seeing early traction with the BBVA customers, maybe if you could dissect where something that might come from in 2022?\nBill Demchak: Well, the new money out, right, so the new clients and new money that we are committing, whether it\u2019s drawn or not, has accelerated for the last bunch of months and a lot of that is related to the newer markets we are including some big wins coming out of the BBVA markets. The utilization part, right, so the money is out now is somebody borrowing more under what line is broad-based. And if you just think about how many clients we have, it\u2019s kind of distributed across everything.\nRob Reilly: Yes. The other thing that I would add to that, Gerard, is that the pipelines in our commercial book are strong. And in the new markets, they are up percentage-wise significantly.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have a question from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Hi.\nBill Demchak: Hi Mike.\nMike Mayo: Bill, you led off saying that BBVA has exceeded expectations, but I didn\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t think I heard any changes to expense savings or synergies or anything like that. So, even if you can\u2019t quantify it, can you talk about what\u2019s going better or worse than expected?\nBill Demchak: Will look better than expected on initial deal terms is largely\u2026\nRob Reilly: Of course, not.\nBill Demchak: Yes, is largely the economy, right. The assumptions where we marked credit and looked at credit turned out to be conservative. But that\u2019s what we saw at that point. That better than expected, if I look at it, I think the teams that we have been able to deploy in the market, some of the talent that BBVA had, some of the talent we were able to hire that the amount of call volume that we are having in the new markets with new products and old clients and with new products and people with new clients, all sort of wildly outpacing what we were able to do with RBC in our newer markets in the past and then just wins, showing up with clients early on. So, that\u2019s kind of all in the business momentum side and continues to give us comfort on our ability to build out the markets. The credit is a lot better than we thought. The expense guide, we go out there and we say take $900 million including investment, and we stick to that. But to Rob\u2019s point, you guys know this of us through time. It doesn\u2019t mean that we are going to stop looking once we hit our expense guide. And I guess I would just leave it there.\nMike Mayo: Where you are leaving is, I guess was really my question. So, why not increase your expense saving target or quantify that? Is that because you are reinvesting it, or you are just being conservative or you are just waiting longer?\nBill Demchak: I think the easiest way to answer that is when I was talking about continuous improvement a little while ago. We kind of know there is stuff there through some metrics and some thought process today. But until we can put an action plan together, quantify it, know how we are going to measure it, I can\u2019t \u2013 I am not just going to throw an expense guide in there that probably is embedded, but I am not sure.\nRob Reilly: And I just think \u2013 this is Rob, Mike. I just think it\u2019s premature. So, we worked hard in 2021 to get that $900 million in savings into that $1.7 billion run rate. So, we got to get going, and this is getting going part.\nMike Mayo: And then I know part of your \u2013 You are in all top 30 U.S. markets now. And I know you want to expand. And so you did guide for, you said, solid positive operating leverage for the year, I get that. On the other hand, isn\u2019t it getting a lot more expensive to hire people to help with that expansion in the new markets?\nBill Demchak: It is, but we have largely hired them off. We hit \u2013 you need to understand, when we closed and then converted, we had basically the teams built out in all of these markets, Mike. So, they are in our run rate.\nMike Mayo: I mean how many people have you hired? I mean these are a lot of the \u2013 and stuff, right?\nBill Demchak: Yes, a lot of people.\nRob Reilly: Okay. The expansion of your question is, are we going to see weight, do we expect to see wage pressure in 2022, we do and that is built into our expense guidance.\nMike Mayo: Okay. Fair enough. Alright. Thank you.\nOperator:  We have a question from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nBill Carcache: Good morning Bill and Rob. Following up on your deposit beta commentary, how are you thinking about the risk that balance sheet runoff, the potential impact it could have in this cycle versus the last one, given that it\u2019s expected to play a bit bigger role versus when we exited the last serve cycle?\nBill Demchak: It\u2019s a great question, and that\u2019s obviously going to impact it. And in the extreme, if they shrink their balance sheet dramatically, it obviously would impact betas and make them higher. The offset to that, though, is you got to remember with loan growth, you actually create deposits, right. So, if loan growth does pick up, as the Fed is dropping their balance sheet, which isn\u2019t unlikely, that loan growth actually generates deposits. If you think about just the leverage on the capital you hold for a loan and the money goes everywhere else. So, I am not sure I have iterated my way through exactly how that\u2019s going to play out other than it feels like the combination of those two things should leave us extremely liquid deposit-wise for the next several years.\nRob Reilly: Which is our base expectation. You have got to keep an eye on it.\nBill Demchak: Yes.\nBill Carcache: Yes. That makes sense. And I guess continuing on that thought process, Bill, do you feel PNC is perhaps a little bit less exposed than some of the larger banks that are primary dealers and more directly involved in the creation of those deposits under the QE process?\nBill Demchak: I don\u2019t think the system works that way. If the Fed shrinks its balance sheet, you will likely see corporate cash \u2013 I don\u2019t know that you can think through it that way. I think it transmits through the banking system and I think it hits everybody largely the same as a function of their corporate and consumer mix, but corporates behavior like corporates and consumers behave like consumers.\nBill Carcache: Got it. And then lastly, I think you touched on this, but just to put a finer point on it, if the pipeline is a strong loan growth trends that you are describing persist? I guess maybe if you can just comment on your willingness to \u2013 or the extent to which that influences your willingness to take your securities portfolio as high as 30%, I guess do you think your liquidity is sufficient to be able to do both fund that stronger loan growth and I think the security or higher is \u2013 I wonder how does that interaction?\nBill Demchak: We have plenty of liquidity to do both.\nBill Carcache: Yes. Got it. Thank you for taking my questions.\nBill Demchak: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And we now have a question from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKen Usdin: Hey. Thanks. Good morning guys. Just wanted to follow-up, Rob, I think you had mentioned when you broke down the revenue guidance that you are looking at fees in the mid-single digits, and obviously, that also includes the BBVA stuff. Last year, it\u2019s ridiculously great year for corporate services, especially. I am just wondering underneath the surface, what do you see as being the underlying growth drivers outside of the BBVA rollover?\nRob Reilly: Yes. I would just say, if you are taking a look at the full year, Ken, just going through the categories, asset management, we would expect to continue to increase in that mid single-digit range, consumer higher than that, in part due to the addition of the BBVA franchise. But as you hit it on corporate services, we had such elevated levels in 2021. Our expectations for 2022 are down a bit. Residential mortgage may be up a little bit and then service charges on deposits down as we get the full year effect of reduced overdraft fees that we expect from low cash mode. So, you put all that together, that\u2019s how you get to mid-single digits.\nKen Usdin: Okay. Got it. And then same thing in terms of just how you are thinking about that other categories, it still live in the kind of zone you are thinking about for the first quarter? Is that how you think about it for the full year?\nRob Reilly: That is, yes.\nKen Usdin: Okay. One little cleanup just on securities yields, Rob. Last quarter, you had that negative impact from the BBVA\u2026\nRob Reilly: We did that. Yes.\nKen Usdin: And then this quarter, it was flattish even, I would think with the absence of that. So, can you kind of just work us through what was the impact in the fourth quarter, if any? And how are you still \u2013 are you at the point where you are seeing better reinvestment yields?\nBill Demchak: Yes, we are starting to. I think investment yield was the story. On a premium amortization issue of the third quarter, which was elevated. It went down in the fourth quarter, but it\u2019s still elevated over what I would consider normal levels. So, that worked against us a little bit as well.\nKen Usdin: Okay, understood. Alright. Thanks Rob.\nOperator: Thank you. And we now have a question from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead sir.\nJohn McDonald: Hi guys. One more on the expenses, it\u2019s pretty impressive for the expense guide for \u201822. If I look at it relative to kind of the fourth quarter annualized, it implies a quarterly run rate, that\u2019s about 5% lower, Rob. So, I guess just kind of unpacking that, is the fourth quarter this year a little high because of the such strong capital markets revenues. And then how are you eating inflation and still getting cost to be 5% lower year-over-year when other banks are having a lot of inflationary pressures, that would be helpful.\nBill Demchak: Yes. No, you hit it. It\u2019s definitely on the wage side in the fourth quarter. And it just goes back as we go into 2022. It goes back to what we were saying earlier in terms of how we laid out the year. We have the cost saves locked in for the BBVA side. We have investments on the non-BBVA side that are largely offset by our continuous improvement numbers. So, that\u2019s how we put it all together, and that\u2019s the plan.\nRob Reilly: John, just because I know all of our employees are listening. We are going to \u2013 this plan assumes that we are paying people competitively in a competitive market for talented people. We just need to find the dollars elsewhere to be able to do that.\nBill Demchak: That\u2019s right.\nJohn McDonald: Got it. And then one industry type question for you guys, you have a lot of reserves relative to peers, mix adjusted on every basis. But we have never seen like CECL working in a loan growth environment. So, just kind of your guys\u2019 thoughts as loan growth starts to pick up for the industry, could we start to see some growth math where you need to add provisions and add to reserves just for growth, or is the 5% growth like contemplated in your reserves today, or as loan growth picks up, do you have growth-driven provisioning?\nBill Demchak: Yes, I can answer that one, John. That\u2019s complex. And in some instances, I don\u2019t know if we know because we haven\u2019t run CECL through an environment like that. But academically speaking, we will get to the point where we will need to grow reserves in concert with your balance sheets, bigger loan balances. But we are still in this place where we are running high in terms of percentage terms. So, there is going to be some offsetting factors there is my guess in 2022.\nJohn McDonald: Yes. Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now turn the conference back to Mr. Demchak for your concluding remarks. Thank you, sir.\nBill Demchak: Alright. No concluding remarks. I know you guys are busy. Thank you for dialing and we got a lot of calls today. Look forward to talking to you in the first quarter. Thanks.\nRob Reilly: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you all for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you once again. Have a great day everyone.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rob Reilly",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill and good morning everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 5 and is presented on an average basis. Overall, year-over-year balance sheet growth was primarily driven by the acquisition of BBVA USA. Loans grew 18%, investment securities increased 49%, and deposits grew 26%. Looking at the linked quarter changes, loans for the fourth quarter were $289 billion, a decline of $2.4 billion or 1%. Excluding $4.7 billion of PPP forgiveness activity, loans grew $2.3 billion or 1% and I will cover the drivers in more detail over the next few slides. Investment securities increased $7 billion or 6% as we maintained higher purchasing activity throughout much of the quarter. Accordingly, cash balances at the Federal Reserve declined by $5 billion. On the liability side, deposit balances declined $1.6 billion as higher commercial and consumer deposits were offset by runoff deposits related to the strategic repricing of certain BBVA USA portfolios during the third quarter and that negatively impacted fourth quarter average balances. However, on a spot basis, total deposits as of December 31 increased $8 billion or 2%, reflecting the continued strong liquidity positions of our customers. At year end, our tangible book value was $94.11 per common share and our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 10.2%, which are both substantially above the pro forma levels we anticipated when we announced the deal. During the quarter, we returned approximately $1.1 billion of capital to shareholders via common dividends of $500 million and share repurchases of $600 million. Given our strong capital ratios, we continue to be well-positioned with significant capital flexibility going forward. Slide 6 shows our average loans and deposits in more detail. In the fourth quarter, loans declined $2.4 billion as growth in commercial and consumer loans was more than offset by a decline in PPP loans of $4.7 billion. Excluding the impact of PPP, commercial loans grew by $2.2 billion or 1%, driven by growth in corporate banking and asset-based lending. During the fourth quarter, we continue to see a slow and steady increase in utilization rates within our corporate and institutional banking business and along with that expanded pipelines. Taken together, these factors are driving our expectations for higher loan growth in 2022. Consumer loans increased modestly linked quarter as higher residential real estate balances were mostly offset by lower home equity and auto loans. Finally, as I mentioned, PPP loans continued to decline due to forgiveness activity. And as of December 31, $3.4 billion of PPP loans remained on our balance sheet. Average deposits of $453 billion declined by $1.6 billion linked quarter for the reasons I previously mentioned. Overall, our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits remained stable at 4 basis points. Slide 7 details the change in our average securities and Federal Reserve balances. As rates increased at the end of the third quarter and throughout the fourth quarter, we continue to opportunistically add securities to our portfolio, primarily U.S. treasuries. As a result, securities balances averaged $128 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of $7.2 billion or 6% compared to the third quarter of 2021 and now represent 26% of interest-earning assets. We continue to have substantial excess liquidity with Fed cash balances averaging $75 billion during the fourth quarter, which we believe positions us well for a rising rate environment. As you can see on Slide 8, fourth quarter 2021 reported EPS was $2.86, which included pre-tax integration costs of $438 million. Excluding integration costs, adjusted EPS was $3.68. As expected, during the fourth quarter, we incurred essentially half of our total anticipated deal integration costs, which reduced revenue by $47 million and increased expenses by $391 million. Since the announcement of the acquisition, we have now incurred approximately 95% of the total $980 million expected integration costs, including $120 million of write-offs for capitalized items. Excluding the impact of integration costs, linked quarter revenue was down $31 million or 1%. Expenses increased $48 million or 1% and pre-tax pre-provision earnings declined $79 million or 4%. The fourth quarter provision recapture was $327 million, reflecting continued improvements in the economic environment. Net income, excluding pre-tax integration costs of $438 million, was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter. Now, let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to Slide 9, these charts illustrate our diversified business mix. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of $5.1 billion decreased $70 million linked quarter, reflecting lower non-interest income. Net interest income of $2.9 billion, was up slightly, primarily a result of higher securities balances. Net interest margin was stable at 2.27%. As I mentioned, integration costs reduced non-interest income by $47 million, which included $19 million of lease exit costs, $17 million of treasury management fee waivers, and $11 million of overdraft waivers. Fourth quarter fee income, excluding integration costs, was $1.9 billion and declined $39 million or 2% linked quarter. Looking at the detail, asset management fees increased $3 million or 1%, primarily related to higher average equity markets. Consumer services grew $12 million or 2% due to higher brokerage and credit card revenue. Corporate service fees increased $14 million or 2%, reflecting higher loan syndications activity as well as continued elevated corporate advisory activity. Residential mortgage non-interest income declined $46 million driven by lower RMSR valuation adjustments and loan sales revenue. Service charges on deposits decreased $22 million, primarily a result of converting BBVA USA customers to PNC's product and overdraft pricing structure. Other non-interest income, excluding integration costs, was stable linked quarter as the impact of a $1 million positive Visa derivative fair value adjustment in the fourth quarter compared to a negative adjustment of $169 million in the third quarter was offset by lower private equity revenue. Turning to Slide 10, our fourth quarter expenses were up by $204 million or 6% linked quarter. The growth was primarily driven by $156 million increase in integration expenses. Excluding the impact of integration expenses of $391 million, non-interest expense increased $48 million or 1%. The growth was largely within personnel costs driven by higher employee benefits expense, an increase in our minimum hourly rate of pay as well as elevated incentive compensation related to strong fee activity. We had a 2021 goal of $300 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program, and we successfully completed actions to achieve that goal. Looking forward to 2022, our annual CIP goal will once again be $300 million. Importantly, as of year end 2021, we completed all of the actions that will drive $900 million of savings related to the BBVA USA acquisition, which we expect to be fully realized in 2022 and is reflected in our expense guidance that I will provide in a few minutes. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 11. Non-performing loans of $2.5 billion decreased $48 million or 2% compared to September 30 and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies of $2 billion on December 31 increased $516 million or 35%. Obviously, this was a large increase, but it was primarily driven by BBDA USA conversion-related administrative and operational delays, which we expect will largely be resolved within the first half of 2022. Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $124 million, an increase of $43 million linked quarter. Commercial net charge-offs declined $5 million, offset by an increase of $48 million in consumer. Inside of the higher consumer net charge-offs, auto grew $28 million and other consumer increased $13 million, reflecting conversion-related impacts as well as seasonality. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans continues to be low and in the fourth quarter was 17 basis points. And during the fourth quarter, our allowance for credit losses declined $471 million, reflecting continued improvements in the economic environment. At quarter end, our reserves were $5.5 billion, representing 1.92% of loans. In summary, PNC reported a strong fourth quarter, which concluded a successful 2021 and we are well positioned for 2022 as we continue to realize the potential of our coast-to-coast franchise. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we expect strong growth over the course of 2022, resulting in 3.5% GDP growth. We also expect 425 basis point increases in the Fed Funds rate in 2022, beginning in May, followed by additional increases in June, September and December. Looking ahead, our full year guidance for 2022 includes the impact of 12 months of BBVA USA results compared to only 7 months in 2021. Taking that into account our outlook for full year 2022 compared to 2021 results is as follows. We expect average loan growth of approximately 10% and 5% on a spot basis. We expect total revenue growth to be 8% to 10%. We expect expenses, excluding integration expense to be up 4% to 6%. And to be clear here, this includes 5 additional months of BBVA USA operating expenses, which equates to a full year increase of approximately $500 million and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. Based on this guidance, we expect we will generate solid positive operating leverage in 2022. Looking ahead at the first quarter of 2022 compared to the recent fourth quarter 2021 results, we expect average loan balances, excluding PPP, to be up approximately 1% to 2%. We expect NII to be down approximately 1% to 2%, reflecting 2 fewer days in the quarter and a decline of approximately $75 million in PPP-related interest income. We expect fee income to be down 4% to 6% due to seasonally lower first quarter client activity as well as elevated fourth quarter fees in certain categories. We expect other non-interest income to be between $375 million and $425 million, excluding integration costs as well as net securities and these activities. Taking our guidance for all components of revenue into consideration, we expect total revenue to decline approximately 3% to 5%. We expect total non-interest expense excluding integration costs, to be down approximately 4% to 6%. And during the quarter, we expect to incur $30 million of integration expense. Finally, we expect first quarter net charge-offs to be between $100 million and $150 million. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions. The only one vote. Yes. In the range that we have that 25% to 30% range date still the range that's in our guidance. Hi. Good morning, John. Yes, sure, John. So full revenue \u2013 full year revenue up 8% to 10%, break down those components, net interest income up low teens. And that does that does factor in the rate increases that we spoke about in the comments \u2013 opening comments and then on the fees, mid-single digits year-over-year. So, those two together get you to the 8% to 10%. Yes, sure. So for the full year guide, it's 10% average, but probably a better indicator is the spot just because of the acquisition dynamics on the average number. So, spot up from period end 5%. And we see a continuation of what we started to see in the fourth quarter, which was some expanded utilization in the commercial book, picking up through 2022. And then a little bit less on the consumer side. Consumer customers are still pretty flush with cash. So loan demand there, certainly in the first half of 2022, we expect to be softer than the commercial side. Yes. Yes. You bet. Well, in terms of our guidance, Erika, what we apply in terms of beta is what we've seen in past cycles, which, generally speaking, will be a lag on the front end. So my expectation and what we built into the guidance is that we will see some beta increase, but not until the end of 2022 and it will probably be more of a factor in \u201823. Just because of the levels of liquidity and deposits that we have. That's right. That's exactly right. The non-BBD USA. Yes. And of course, our continuous improvement of $300 million offset investments. And that's something that we've been doing for a number of years. Yes. And that won't stop us from going after it. With the Fed cash balances. Yes. So that's right. On simpler terms, the yields on the securities portfolio can change a lot. Good morning. And resulting from the unique dynamics of the pandemic. So, it's an unusual setup. Yes. The other thing that I would add to that, Gerard, is that the pipelines in our commercial book are strong. And in the new markets, they are up percentage-wise significantly. Of course, not. And I just think \u2013 this is Rob, Mike. I just think it's premature. So, we worked hard in 2021 to get that $900 million in savings into that $1.7 billion run rate. So, we got to get going, and this is getting going part. Okay. The expansion of your question is, are we going to see weight, do we expect to see wage pressure in 2022, we do and that is built into our expense guidance. Which is our base expectation. You have got to keep an eye on it. Yes. I would just say, if you are taking a look at the full year, Ken, just going through the categories, asset management, we would expect to continue to increase in that mid single-digit range, consumer higher than that, in part due to the addition of the BBVA franchise. But as you hit it on corporate services, we had such elevated levels in 2021. Our expectations for 2022 are down a bit. Residential mortgage may be up a little bit and then service charges on deposits down as we get the full year effect of reduced overdraft fees that we expect from low cash mode. So, you put all that together, that's how you get to mid-single digits. That is, yes. We did that. Yes. John, just because I know all of our employees are listening. We are going to \u2013 this plan assumes that we are paying people competitively in a competitive market for talented people. We just need to find the dollars elsewhere to be able to do that. Thank you."

            "name": "Bill Demchak",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian and good morning everybody. As you've seen, we had a strong fourth quarter and full year for 2021. We successfully completed the conversion of BBVA USA early in the fourth quarter and have been running hard as one bank since then. The transaction continues to meet or exceed our deal projections and Rob will give you some of those details. I am especially pleased by our ability to announce, close and convert a transaction of this size inside of 11 months. Challenges notwithstanding, we had the talent, the technology and the strategy to accomplish this and to combine our organization in a way that will provide growth opportunities for years to come. The acquisition positions us with a coast-to-coast presence and along with our continued organic growth strategies, including our recent expansion into Las Vegas, we now have a presence in all of the top 30 U.S. markets. We are excited about the opportunity this presents and we are confident in our ability to generate growth by executing on our Main Street relationship-based model. That said, we recognized that we have a lot of work to do in building out the new and expansion markets, which will be our primary focus in 2022. BBVA obviously impacted our results for the full year and Rob will walk you through the details. Excluding BBVA, we generated record revenue, highlighted by strong non-interest income with broad-based contributions across our commercial and consumer businesses. We also maintained outstanding credit quality and a very strong capital position. While we continue to opportunistically deploy some of our excess cash into higher yielding securities throughout the year, we remain well-positioned with substantial excess liquidity to capitalize on a rising interest rate environment. Our reported results for the fourth quarter reflected the impact of almost $440 million of BBVA integration costs. Excluding these, we generated nearly $1.6 billion of net income and solid returns. Importantly, excluding the impact of PPP loan forgiveness, we saw decent underlying loan growth trends and some uptick in utilization rates, which is very encouraging, as Rob will discuss in more detail. Critical to our long-term success has been the quality and stability of our talent and we pride ourselves of being an employer of choice, given the recent dynamics of the substantially increased competition for talent. In part due to the great resignation, we experienced greater wage pressure during the fourth quarter and I expect that to persist into the coming year. Naturally, we will look to offset these increases with our continuous improvement efforts, which include driving further automation and rethinking core processes. We continue to invest in technology to enhance our capabilities in an increasingly digital world. Customers are looking to their financial providers to offer innovative tools that help them manage their money in ways that are faster, smarter and more convenient, whether that be expanded use cases for Zelle, where transaction volumes are up 50% or low cash mode. For example, by providing account transparency and control, low cash mode has substantially reduced customer overdraft fees and related complaints. I will close by thanking our employees for their hard work and steadfast commitment to our customers and communities. Because of our employees, we had a remarkable year and are well-positioned to serve all of our stakeholders in 2022 and beyond. And with that, I will turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our results and then we'll take your questions. Well, you kind of answered your own question because we're consistent. All else equal in this environment first focus on the potential of loan growth and using it a good way, a bias, strong bias towards dividend, but we will still be in the market to repurchase shares. And I think you'll probably see us accelerate some of the things we're doing on the smaller side in terms of product activity bolt-ons into TM and so forth. None of that \u2013 by the way, those acquisitions won't add up too much, but they have become an important part of just adding core capabilities as we go into a digitized world. So our economist expects for hikes. I actually think it's going to be more aggressive than that, but I'm an outlier in our committee, and we.... And our forecast is at this point, pretty much on the forward curve at this point. I think the plan, Rob, I don't know if you want to talk to the plan of we're going to gradually add duration throughout the year. There wasn't any magic to it, and we didn't really build in, in Rob's guidance some assumption that we would go at it even more aggressively for each reacted. Yes. Yes. Good morning, Erika. No. No. So to unpack the guide for next year, the \u2013 I think the P&C legacy expenses are up maybe 1%. Yes. Yes. And so did we prepack investment? We've said all along that we've had a steady state and actually a fairly high level of investment in our core business. And then you'll remember in the guidance for BBVA that in the $900 million of cost saves, that was a netted number against investments we are going to make to build out those markets. So inside of everything you're seeing there actually has a lot of investment already built into it. I also think \u2013 we've had \u2013 it's worth noting, we've had some debate internally on the continuous improvement number and can it be larger? Because I think we all see opportunities in the operating environment as we move forward with BBVA. The challenge is continuous improvement is something you know you can do, whereas right now, we're still in the process of we know it's there. We just don't know where yet. Once we kind of lock it down and can track it, it shows up in continuous improvement. Exactly. Hey, Betsy. We will leg in throughout the course. But remember, what's in our guide on securities, doesn't dent our liquidity profile. So what we have in our guide here is kind of steady deployment working towards the 25% to 30% will add balances. It doesn't even dent the potential of what we could do with liquidity. Yes. Yes. So it's kind of a \u2013 it's a baseline budget boring. The rates do this. We do the following. If there is if rates go beyond or even if we get to a place where we think rates have probably gone where they need to go, not as high as I think they'll go. We could increase that, but that's not contemplated in the forecast that we have right now. Yes. And remember inside of that mix, right, that's a big portfolio of securities, big difference in the yield coming out of buying short-dated treasuries, which has been kind of our recent trade versus going further out the curve and going back towards mortgages once you assume the extension risk is taken out. Massive difference in yields. So it's \u2013 some of it's notional of security. Some of it's what you're actually buying and both of those will be driven by the speed and outlook for rates over time. Yes. No, if my individual view is right, there is a lot of upside. But the forecast that we've given you and what's kind of in our plan is steady state follow the forwards and leg in over time. Yes. Two very different questions. We \u2013 as you've seen, we've done a number of small things, Tempus probably being the most interesting one where we bring in certain payment capabilities that lead to other opportunities. And we see more and more of those. By the way, we're not unique at that. A lot of banks are playing in the space. They are not terribly expensive, but oftentimes, you get modules of technology that can be sort of bought into and then scaled across your broader platform. So that's \u2013 I just think you're going to see more of that as we continue to compete in digital space for both the consumer and the corporate. On the branch side, we have plans to further as we always do, kind of build out selectively in the markets where we're underpenetrated. But at the same time, you'll see us continue our practice of consolidating the thicker market so no real change there and all that's in the numbers we've given you. Good morning, Gerard. Well, so you got to separate something, our credit box per se, right? So the type of clients we lend to, the leverage they can have, all the things you would otherwise measure. We really don't change that over time. Having said that, of course, even inside of that box companies are doing better or they are doing \u2013 trending more poorly. I think we are going to go into a period of time here as we go towards the end of the year. We are all else equal, there will be pressure on credit, not because we changed our underwriting standards, but because of the downgrade ratio will change. Rob and I were talking before the call, if you actually look at our reserve ratio, particularly when you adjust it for credit cards, I can't think of a period of time where you are kind of going into rising rate environment, which is going to help us, loan growth, which is going to help us and feeling healthy reserves when you compare where we are versus \u2013 I will just call it that versus the rest of the industry in terms of raw percentages against balance and you know our book through legacy performance. Yes. Well, the new money out, right, so the new clients and new money that we are committing, whether it's drawn or not, has accelerated for the last bunch of months and a lot of that is related to the newer markets we are including some big wins coming out of the BBVA markets. The utilization part, right, so the money is out now is somebody borrowing more under what line is broad-based. And if you just think about how many clients we have, it's kind of distributed across everything. Hi Mike. Will look better than expected on initial deal terms is largely... Yes, is largely the economy, right. The assumptions where we marked credit and looked at credit turned out to be conservative. But that's what we saw at that point. That better than expected, if I look at it, I think the teams that we have been able to deploy in the market, some of the talent that BBVA had, some of the talent we were able to hire that the amount of call volume that we are having in the new markets with new products and old clients and with new products and people with new clients, all sort of wildly outpacing what we were able to do with RBC in our newer markets in the past and then just wins, showing up with clients early on. So, that's kind of all in the business momentum side and continues to give us comfort on our ability to build out the markets. The credit is a lot better than we thought. The expense guide, we go out there and we say take $900 million including investment, and we stick to that. But to Rob's point, you guys know this of us through time. It doesn't mean that we are going to stop looking once we hit our expense guide. And I guess I would just leave it there. I think the easiest way to answer that is when I was talking about continuous improvement a little while ago. We kind of know there is stuff there through some metrics and some thought process today. But until we can put an action plan together, quantify it, know how we are going to measure it, I can't \u2013 I am not just going to throw an expense guide in there that probably is embedded, but I am not sure. It is, but we have largely hired them off. We hit \u2013 you need to understand, when we closed and then converted, we had basically the teams built out in all of these markets, Mike. So, they are in our run rate. Yes, a lot of people. It's a great question, and that's obviously going to impact it. And in the extreme, if they shrink their balance sheet dramatically, it obviously would impact betas and make them higher. The offset to that, though, is you got to remember with loan growth, you actually create deposits, right. So, if loan growth does pick up, as the Fed is dropping their balance sheet, which isn't unlikely, that loan growth actually generates deposits. If you think about just the leverage on the capital you hold for a loan and the money goes everywhere else. So, I am not sure I have iterated my way through exactly how that's going to play out other than it feels like the combination of those two things should leave us extremely liquid deposit-wise for the next several years. Yes. I don't think the system works that way. If the Fed shrinks its balance sheet, you will likely see corporate cash \u2013 I don't know that you can think through it that way. I think it transmits through the banking system and I think it hits everybody largely the same as a function of their corporate and consumer mix, but corporates behavior like corporates and consumers behave like consumers. We have plenty of liquidity to do both. Thank you. Yes, we are starting to. I think investment yield was the story. On a premium amortization issue of the third quarter, which was elevated. It went down in the fourth quarter, but it's still elevated over what I would consider normal levels. So, that worked against us a little bit as well. Yes. No, you hit it. It's definitely on the wage side in the fourth quarter. And it just goes back as we go into 2022. It goes back to what we were saying earlier in terms of how we laid out the year. We have the cost saves locked in for the BBVA side. We have investments on the non-BBVA side that are largely offset by our continuous improvement numbers. So, that's how we put it all together, and that's the plan. That's right. Yes, I can answer that one, John. That's complex. And in some instances, I don't know if we know because we haven't run CECL through an environment like that. But academically speaking, we will get to the point where we will need to grow reserves in concert with your balance sheets, bigger loan balances. But we are still in this place where we are running high in terms of percentage terms. So, there is going to be some offsetting factors there is my guess in 2022. Alright. No concluding remarks. I know you guys are busy. Thank you for dialing and we got a lot of calls today. Look forward to talking to you in the first quarter. Thanks."

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to The PNC Bank's Third Quarter Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bryan Gill. Sir, please go ahead.\nBryan Gill: Thank you, Jennifer. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President, and CEO, Bill Demchak, and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President, and CFO. Today's presentation contains Forward-looking information, cautionary statements about this information, as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials, as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These materials are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of October 15th, 2021, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Demchak: Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everybody. I imagine you have seen that earlier this week we completed our conversion of BBVA USA, and I got to say I'm really proud of the team and our ability to sign, close, and convert a $100 billion banking institution within a year. The dedication of our employees and our sustained investments in technology allowed us to convert roughly 9,000 employees, 2.6 million customers, and nearly 600 branches across 7 states. BBVA USA is now integrated into PNC and its customers can bank with us from coast to coast. We're bringing our technology talent and the full suite of best-in-class products and services to 29 of the nation's 30 largest markets. with attractive growth opportunities as you've heard me talk about for years to come. Now while we still have some more work to do, which is to be expected for bank conversion of this site, we're making solid progress with our staffing levels and the branch operations, and BBVA USA legacy markets. In addition, we're encouraged to see the teams build pipelines and importantly, growing new clients. That was BBVA legacy employees now on PNC systems, we believe our momentum is going to continue to accelerate as we previously, we're following the same game plan that we've used in previous acquisitions. And we know what to do and we just have to execute on it. With respect to our third-quarter results, we had a solid quarter highlighted by strong revenue growth, which included record fee income in our PNC legacy businesses, and continued improvements in credit quality, similar to last quarter and pretty much as expected, we had a lot of moving parts on our reported results. And of course, Rob will take you through those in a few minutes. Loan growth continues to be impacted by supply chain issues and the continued runoff of PPP loans and also, the strategic repositioning of the BBVA portfolio so which is consistent with our acquisition projections. That said, total PNC legacy loans if we backup the PPP runoff, actually grew almost 5 billion with growth in both Commercial and Consumer categories. And while the environment is still challenging, we're actually pretty encouraged by what we're seeing on the corporate side with spot utilization rates stabilizing and even rising a little on the back of strong new originations and our secured lending and corporate banking businesses. And on the consumer side, we're also seeing promising origination activity, particularly in the residential real estate business. Importantly, and as you see our balance sheet remains very strong and we're well-positioned with substantial capital and liquidity to continue to support our expanded customer base while making strategic investments in our technology and businesses. Another exciting development this quarter was the announcement of our integration with a clear data access network. This is through an application programming interface. The integration is going to allow millions of our customers, if they choose to do so, to safely share their financial information with FinTechs and data aggregators. It's an important step in our efforts to help our customers protect their data. We're also giving them the choice to share their data with third-party applications. Similar to low cash mode, this integration positions us as a leader in technology and innovation and enables us to best serve our customers. And I'd like to close just by thanking our employees throughout the newly-combined franchise for all their hard work, which enabled this conversion. A significant collaboration across all divisions is impressive and it gives me great confidence that we'll capitalize on the enormous opportunities ahead of us. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our results, and then we'll take your questions.\nRob Reilly: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill just mentioned, and notable during the third quarter, we converted the BBVA USA franchise to the PNC platform in less than 11 months following the announcement of the deal. PNC's increased scale from this acquisition underscores the opportunity we have with the BBVA USA franchise. We have a proven track record of acquiring attractive strategic opportunities, identifying and reducing inherent risks, and successfully growing franchises to deliver enhanced shareholder value. And as Bill just mentioned, we're well on our way to accomplishing this with BBVA USA. Due to the June 1 closing of the acquisition, our average balance sheet growth for the third quarter reflected the full quarter impact of the acquisition. As loans grew $36 billion, securities increased $12 billion, and deposits grew $53 billion. For comparative purposes for the second quarter, which you'll recall included just one month of BBVA USA results, our balance sheet on Slide 3 is presented on a spot basis. Total spot loans declined $4.5 billion or 2% linked-quarter, excluding the impact of PPP forgiveness, loans grew. And I'll cover the drivers in more detail over the next few slides. Investment securities declined approximately $900 million or 1%, as we slowed purchase activity throughout much of the quarter during the relatively unattractive rate environment. Our cash balances at the Federal Reserve continued to grow and ended the third quarter at $75 billion. On a liability side, deposit balances were $449 billion on September 30th and declined $4 billion reflecting the repositioning of certain BBVA USA portfolios. We ended the quarter with a tangible book value of $94.82 per share and an estimated CET1 ratio of 10.2%. Both are substantially above the pro forma levels we anticipated at the time of the deal announcement. During the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders with common dividends of $537 million and share repurchases of $393 million. Given our strong capital ratios, we continue to be well-positioned with significant capital flexibility going forward. Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Average loans increased $36 billion linked quarter to $291 billion, reflecting the full quarter impact of the acquisition. Taking a closer look at the linked quarter change in our spot balances, total loans declined $4.5 billion. The PNC legacy portfolio, excluding PPP loans, grew by $4.7 billion or 2%, with growth in both commercial and consumer loans. PNC Legacy Commercial loans grew $3.7 billion, driven by growth within Corporate Banking and asset-based lending. The stroke in balances has been aided by a slight uptake in spot utilization. And while still near historic lows, utilization did reach its highest level since December 2020. Growth in PNC's Legacy Consumer loans linked quarter was driven by higher residential real estate balances. Within the BBVA USA portfolio, loans declined $4.4 billion primarily due to intentional run-off relating to the overlapping exposures of the non-strategic loans. Looking ahead, we have approximately $5 billion of additional BBVA USA loans that we intend to let roll off over the next few years, which is in line with our acquisition assumptions. Finally, PPP loans declined $4.8 billion due to forgiveness activity. And as of September 30th, $6.8 billion of PPP loans remained on our balance sheet. Moving to Slide 5, average deposits of $454 billion increased $53 billion compared to the second quarter, driven by the acquisition. On the right, you can see total period-end deposits were $449 billion on September 30, a decline of $4 billion, or 1% linked-quarter. Inside of this PNC legacy deposits increased $5.4 billion, as deposits continued to grow, reflecting the strong liquidity position of our customers. BBVA USA deposits declined approximately $9.4 billion during the third quarter, which was anticipated as we rationalized the rate paid on certain acquired commercial deposit portfolios and exited several non-core deposit-related businesses. Overall our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits is now 4 basis points or 1 basis point decline linked-quarter. Slide 6 details the change in our period and securities and Federal Reserve balances. And as most of you know, we have been disciplined in deploying our excess liquidity with rates at historically low levels. Back to the beginning of the year as the yield curve steepened, we accelerated our rate of purchasing activity. However, towards the end of the second quarter, we deliberately slowed our purchases as yields declined. With the increase in rates at the end of the third quarter, we've resumed our increased levels of purchasing, including $5.4 billion of forward-settling securities, which will be reflected in the fourth quarter. Average security balances now represent approximately 24% of interest-earning assets, and we still expect to be in the range of approximately 25 to 30% by year-end. As you can see on Slide 7, our third quarter Income Statement includes the full quarter impact of the acquisition. The reported EPS was $3.30, which included pretax integration costs of $243 million. Excluding integration costs adjusted, EPS was $3.75. Third-quarter revenue was up 11% compared with the second quarter, reflecting the acquisition as well as strong organic fee growth. Expenses increased $537 million or 18% linked quarter, including $235 million of integration expenses, and 2 additional months of BBVA USA operating expenses. Legacy PNC expenses increased $76 million or 2.7%, virtually, all of which was driven by higher fee business activity. Pre-tax, pre-provision earnings, excluding integration costs, were $1.9 billion $25 million, or 7%. The provision re-capture of $203 million was primarily driven by improved credit quality and changes in portfolio composition and our effective tax rate was 17.8%. For the full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 17%. As a result, total Net Income was $1.5 billion in the third quarter. Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to slide 8, these charts illustrate our diversified business mix. In total, the revenue of $5.2 billion increased by $530 million linked quarter. Net interest income of $2.9 billion was up $275 million or 11%, reflecting the full quarter benefit of the earning asset balances acquired from BBVA USA. Inside of that, interest income on loans increased $277 million or 13% while investment securities income declined $9 million, driven by elevated premium amortization on the acquired BBVA USA portfolio. A net interest margin of 2.27% was down 2 basis points, driven primarily by lower security yields. Importantly in the fourth quarter, we expect premium amortization to decline meaningfully and the yield on the securities portfolio to increase. The third quarter fee income of $1.9 billion, increased $274 million or 17% linked-quarter. BBVA USA contributed a fee income of $184 million, an increase of a $122 million linked quarter, driven by two additional months of operating results. Legacy PNC fees grew by a $152 million linked quarter or 10% driven by higher corporate service fees related to recording M&A advisory activity, as well as growth in residential mortgage revenue. Other non-interest income of $449 million decreased $19 million linked quarter as higher private equity revenue was more than offset by the impact of a $169 million negative Visa derivative adjustment. This adjustment relates to the extension of the expected timing of litigation resolution. Turning to slide 9, our third quarter expenses were up by $537 million or 18% linked-quarter. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of higher BBVA USA expenses of $327 million and higher integration expenses of $134 million. PNC Legacy expenses increased $76 million or 2.7% due to higher incentive compensation commensurate with a strong performance in our fee businesses, including a record quarter in M&A advisory fees. Our efficiency ratio adjusted for integration costs was 64%. Obviously, with the acquisition, our expense base is now higher but nevertheless, we remain disciplined around our expense management. And as we've stated previously, we have a goal to reduce PNC standalone expenses by $300 million in 2021, through our Continuous improvement program and we're on track to achieve our full-year target. Additionally, we're confident we'll realize the full $900 million in net expense savings off of our forecasts of BBVA U.S.A.'s 2022 expense base, and expect virtually all of the actions that drive the $900 million of savings to be completed by the end of 2021. We still expect to incur integration costs of approximately $980 million related to the acquisition. Since the announcement of the acquisition, we have incurred approximately half of these integration costs. And as Bill mentioned, we appreciate all the hard work our teammates have done to keep us on track and to achieve these goals. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 10 and reflect strong credit performance. Non-performing loans of $2.5 billion decreased $251 million or 9% compared to June 30th, and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies of $1.4 billion on September 30th increased a $106 million or 8%. However, this increase includes approximately $75 million of operational delays in early-stage delinquencies primarily related to BBVA USA acquired loans. Subsequent to quarter-end, all of these operational delinquencies have been or are in the process of being resolved. Excluding these, total delinquencies would have increased $31 million or 2%. Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $81 million, a decline of $225 million linked quarter. The second quarter included $248 million of charge-offs related to BBVA USA loans, mostly the result of required purchase accounting and treatment for the acquisition. Our annualized net charge-offs, loans in the third quarter were 11 basis points. During the third quarter, our allowance for credit losses declined $374 million, primarily driven by improvement in credit quality, as well as changes in portfolio composition. At quarter-end, our reserves were $6 billion representing 2.07% of loans. In summary, PNC reported a strong third quarter, and notably, earlier this week converted the BBVA USA franchise. With this step completed, we expect to add significant value to our shareholders as we continue to realize the potential of the combined Company. In regard to our view of the overall economy, after somewhat slower growth during the third quarter of 2021 due in part to the Delta variant and supply chain problems, we expect GDP to accelerate to above 6% annualized in the fourth quarter. We also expect the Fed funds rate to remain near zero for the remainder of the year. Looking at the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the recent third-quarter results, we expect average loan balances, excluding PPP, to be up modestly. We expect NII to be up modestly. On a percentage basis, we expect fee income to be down between 3% and 5%, mostly reflecting the elevated third quarter M&A activity. We expect other non-interest income to be between $375 and $425 million excluding net securities and fees activity. On a percent, we expect the total non-interest expense to be down between 3% and 5% excluding integration expense, which we approximate to be $450 million during the fourth quarter. And we expect fourth-quarter net charge-offs to be between $100 and $150 million. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you.  Your first question comes from the line of Dave George with Baird. Please go ahead with your question.\nDave George: : Hey, guys. Good morning. I had a question on the line of loans --\nRob Reilly: Good morning, Dave.\nDave George: : Good morning, Rob. On loans -- so you said on the BBVA, there's an additional $5 billion of declines to come. Can you give us a sense with respect to the timing and how you see that portfolio running off? And then I've got a follow-up.\nRob Reilly: Sure. Again, good morning, Dave. So of the 5 billion that we've identified going forward that we intend to run off, 2 billion of that we expect to run off in the fourth quarter, and that's part of our guidance. The remainder, likely over the next couple of years.\nDave George: : Great. Thanks for that.\nRob Reilly: Sure.\nDave George: : In terms of the Legacy PNC CNI businesses, obviously it was encouraging to see a little bit of organic growth in the third quarter. Can you give us a sense, and this may be difficult, but clearly supply chain is weighing on working capital needs and I'm curious if you can contrast the growth and commitments relative to the growth and outstanding in the commercial. I'm just curious how the commercial business is doing with respect to adding new names and new commitments and the not seeing the benefit of that at least today in terms of outstandings because of that inventory issue.\nBill Demchak: Hi, it's Bill. We've been, for the last couple of quarters, our new money commitments have been, I think maybe at record levels, Rob, but increasing each quarter. And so new business, new clients, in some cases just upsizing what we already had. And then quarter, we had a little bit utilization, but most of this was kind of new client growth.\nDave George: : Yeah, that's right.\nBill Demchak: Right.\nRob Reilly: And then -- and as you know, Dave, as we've mentioned, that utilization kicked up a little bit. Still at historic lows, but a little bit, and that was part of it too.\nDave George: : Sounds good, guys. Thanks.\nBill Demchak: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of John Penn Carey from Evercore ISI, please go ahead.\nJohn Penn Carey: Good morning.\nRob Reilly: Good morning, John.\nJohn Penn Carey: On the loan growth topic, that tick up in utilization and then also the new clients that you mentioned. Can you give us a little more detail on what areas, what business areas, which industries that you're starting to see that momentum start to build?\nBill Demchak: Yeah, they're kind of related, I mean, the growth in our secured lending areas stood out and they traditionally have higher utilization, so in some ways, it was an increase in the overall average because we grew the book with the highest individual average rate. But even in the straight middle-market corporate book, it finally stabilized, and I guess went up a couple of basis points there as well.\nRob Reilly: A little bit, yeah.\nJohn Penn Carey: Yeah.\nRob Reilly: Yeah, so basically business credit, or asset-based lending group and corporate banking.\nJohn Penn Carey: Got it. Okay. And then on the expense side, just wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about wage inflation if you're starting to see any signs of that in your franchise. And also, if so, are there any risks to how we're thinking about the merger costs or the 900 million in net cost saves? Thanks\nBill Demchak: With respect to wage inflation, you might have seen an announcement that we increased our base rate to at least 18 and beyond that, in some cases in certain markets. So it --\nRob Reilly: $18 an hour.\nBill Demchak: Yes, sorry. And so that is real, but that was already assumed in our financial assumptions. It doesn't have anything to do with our recent cost saves. But there's real pressure there and the only way through time to offset that pressure is through increased automation and then just frankly control on overall headcount.\nJohn Penn Carey: Okay. So fair to say though, longer-term impact on how you view the long-term efficiency ratio for the bank?\nBill Demchak: Too early to tell, right? We're on this -- so average wages per employee are going to go up. The issue is how quickly we -- how we scale our franchise through automation so we become larger without more employees. And that's played out for a period of time here, John. if you just go through our financial statements, even going back for five years. We just need to continue that trend to be able to continue our pursuit of positive operating leverage.\nRob Reilly: And to offset what is real in terms of wage pressure.\nBill Demchak: Yeah.\nJohn Penn Carey: Yeah. Got it. All right, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler, please go ahead.\nScott Siefers: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Rob, was hoping to drill into the expense dynamics a little more, so your fees, excellent this quarter, those will come down but still appear to remain very strong. As it relates to the kind of the related cost outlook, how much of your expense guide contemplates sort of ongoing costs related to that strong fee momentum? And then can you maybe size up how the 900 million in BBVA related cost-savings fit into the fourth-quarter guide? In other words, how much starts to come next quarter or comes next quarter, and then how much is into 2022, is still?\nRob Reilly: Sure. So that's a lot there, Scott, but the easy answer to that is that's all in the guidance for the fourth quarter. So we -- to your point, fee businesses have been -- were good in the third quarter, they've been good all year. Across-the-board Asset Management, Consumer Services, Corporate Services, particularly in the third quarter, as well as Residential Mortgage. And with the exception of the elevated levels of M&A activity in Corporate Services, we see all of that continuing into the fourth quarter and that's part of the guide. So there'll be expenses that are obviously associated with that. In terms of the 900 million in savings, we are achieving savings. Presently, we got some in the third quarter, we'll get some more in the fourth quarter. That's part of the guide, but the bulk of the savings will be in 2022. So reaffirming the 900 million in savings, a portion of which we'll recognize in 2021, and then of course going forward into 2022, all in our guidance.\nScott Siefers: Perfect. Thank you. And then you touched on this in your prepared remarks, but that elevated premium amortization at BBVA that weighed on the consolidated Company's securities portfolio yield. Can you just expand upon that a little, please?\nBill Demchak: It was painful. In its simplest form, we marked that securities book when we closed the deal, at really low rates that then continued through -- in fact, rallied through the quarter. So the prepay rates on their CMOs increase, and we had -- so you think about it, we mark a book to whatever the yield was, it's at a premium. All of that prepays because of the low rates, hopefully, we expect that to abate as rates have now going back up. But we mark them as premium securities and then got caught by the --\nRob Reilly: And it was a function of the timing of the acquisition, setting up those securities as premium securities.\nBill Demchak: In its simplest form, what we did if you think about it, is it knocked down goodwill in the way when we marked a book because we had a higher-valued asset. So, it, in fact, took in Income upfront and pay for it a little bit this quarter.\nRob Reilly: That's right.\nBill Demchak: I mean, Rob the securities yield once the guide on the -- like that book yielded 50 basis points or something.\nRob Reilly: That happens, yeah.\nBill Demchak: Yeah. And it is. And we expect going forward the total book to increase.\nRob Reilly: That's right, which is what I said in my comments. That's right.\nScott Siefers: Yeah. I'm glad to hear that.\nRob Reilly: It is acquisition-related.\nBill Demchak: Yeah, and it was painful.\nScott Siefers: Exactly. Good. All right, well perfect, I appreciate the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nBetsy Graseck: Hey, good morning.\nRob Reilly: Morning Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: I know we've had a lot of expense discussions already, but I'm just looking at what you've done so far in the quarter. When I look at your detail around the run rate of expenses, the BBVA in 2Q, the one month there that you had, and the three months -- 3 or 4 months that you had in 3Q, it already looks like you brought down expenses a bit. And I'm just trying to understand what you've done so far and what's left from here because you've already executed a bit seems to me, am I missing something there?\nRob Reilly: No. No. You're right. Hey, Betsy, this is Rob, but you're right. We've started, as we said, we would so we have begun to realize expense savings pretty much across all the categories. But we're just getting started so what you see in that , we still have work to go.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. And then, when I'm thinking about the pace of that expense save from here, a part of it is a function of the conversion, the lift and shift obviously --\nRob Reilly: Yeah, right.\nBetsy Graseck: -- but then can you talk us through what comes after the lift and shift, in terms of expense save trajectory?\nBill Demchak: I don't even know what to talk about. I mean --\nRob Reilly: Like when you talk about the activities and then like --\nBill Demchak: Line items? I mean, we have --\nBetsy Graseck: No. Like branch closures and what -- and really the question is --\nBill Demchak: Some of its branch closures -- some of it will be in the form of people who have stayed with us through conversion on stay bonuses. There will be shutdown of systems and vendor contracts and all sorts of different things that will roll through dependent on time. Some of which we leave around for a bit as backup for -- notwithstanding the fact we've converted, we'll leave some stuff up and running for a little bit of time just for the in-case.\nRob Reilly: I think that's right. And probably at least in terms of the pickup in the fourth-quarter activity, we will -- at the mix, we will pick up more vendor savings. We've already started that and we will start to pick those up but at an accelerated rate.\nBetsy Graseck: And I guess the question really is lifting shift as a percentage of total cost saves is like round number?\nBill Demchak: It gives -- that's the wrong way to think about it. The fact that we get that done at one point in time allows us to then aggressively move costs. Because Legacy System shutdown, Legacy Vendor shutdown, related people who are supporting old applications, all of that stuff now starts rolling through the system.\nBetsy Graseck: Yeah. Yes. And my point is it's not one and done, it's a portion of the total expense save that you'll be generating.\nBill Demchak: Yes. And you know that -- look, at the end of the day the guidance is the guidance, right? We're going to get some more in the fourth quarter and then we're going to get it all next year.\nRob Reilly: Yeah, and I just see it. I see it.\nBill Demchak: We're on track. We will get it all. We know the line items where it will come from.\nRob Reilly: I just think I think the way to think about it, Betsy, is its sequential. So that conversion in the lifted shift creates a deck, so to speak, to get started sooner rather than later on realizing those savings.\nBetsy Graseck: Got it. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC, please go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning, Bill. Good morning, Rob.\nBill Demchak: Hey, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Can you guys share with us you mentioned a few times and within the Corporate Services numbers that the Advisory Business, I think you said in the press release it was at record levels, but you -- Rob, in your guidance, you're expected to come down. Other than the obvious pipeline that you guys see in your book, can you share with us what else your guys on the front lines are seeing about M&A? is it just that there's just not as much -- as many companies that are left to do M&A and going into '22?\nBill Demchak: Look, in its simplest form, you set a record, you assume you won't keep setting records. There's nothing out there that suggests necessarily that it's going to weaken from here. But by the way, inside of that, we obviously have , but we also had breakout quarters for Solebury and  and related advisors. If the market continues, that will continue to have great fee income out of it, but it's hard to keep, say we're going to budget or record upon a record. I think it's as simple as that.\nRob Reilly: That's right.\nGerard Cassidy: Got it. And what does it represent now of corporate services or what did it represent in the third quarter?\nRob Reilly: Well -- yeah. No. I know the -- let's say, I'll do the quick math in my head down 25%.\nGerard Cassidy: Got it. Okay. And then question on the loan to deposit ratio, you and your peers, of course, having incredible amounts of liquidity and net ratio has come down. We've -- looks like the Fed now is going to enter into a tapering phase and clearly, there's still be adding to the deposits of the banking system until tapering is over. How are you guys looking at -- and I know there's a lot of moving parts with loan growth and maybe some deposits shrinkage. But when you look out over the end of '22, and into '23 BBVA is fully integrated. What do you think is an optimal loan to deposit ratio for you folks? And when do you think you could get there?\nBill Demchak: There's too many variables.\nGerard Cassidy: Yeah, okay.\nBill Demchak: I mean, if you go back in history, right? People would operate, I don't know where we were, 80%, 85%.\nRob Reilly: 85, yeah 85 to 90.\nBill Demchak: And that was kind of a liquidity safety function. So if you were short liquidity at that point, you'd raise wholesale liquidity to kind of keep your ratio at that point. Today, we're so flush with reserves into the system, wholesale funding is next to 0, and until the Fed -- forget about tapering, actually shrinks its balance sheet, that's not going to change. Now, loan growth even accelerated, and exaggerated loan growth will absorb some of that. But I think you're going to see in loan to deposit ratios low for a long period of time. And therefore, I think you're going to see security balances as a percentage of the balance sheet and we've already talked about this increase across the industry. And that's going to -- I think it's going to take years to play out.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. I appreciate the color. Thank you.\nBill Demchak: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities, please go ahead with your question.\nMike Mayo: Hi.\nRob Reilly: Hi, Mike.\nBill Demchak: Hi, Mike.\nMike Mayo: No good deed goes unpunished. So since you -- from announcement to conversion under 11 months, it's probably a record why aren't you increasing your $900 million cross savings? But more generally, having completed the lift and shift conversion over the weekend, what parts of your technology do you think are further validated? Whether it's your use of the Cloud or Data Lakes or something digital that you're doing that you think others have n't advanced as far as you have?\nBill Demchak: Well look, with the first question. At the end of the day, we're always in the business of figuring out how to become more efficient. I think of the 900 is line items we know we can get. We actually know where they're coming from and when they're going to show up. So you're right at the margin we'll find some other stuff. By the way, we'll probably find some stuff we need to invest in too. So we just put that into our guidance. We say \"Look, we'll get the 900. \" We'll talk to you about '22 when we get closer but we haven't lost focus on the primary objective.\nRob Reilly: And the 900, you know that, Mike. The 900 was estimated off the expectation that we convert and when we did. So, we didn't convert sooner than we thought, we did it on time.\nBill Demchak: So but that's -- but there was a number that -- how to say this, visual until we can see it. We know the line items, it's very precise. The technology, look, it worked. We had at the margin, some confusion with retail clients on password resets and some other things, but the basic technology moving it overturned it on, it all worked. It's this just phenomenal effort by our team and validates the investment we've made over the years. I don't know what people have or don't have in terms of their ability to do that, but the biggest element for us, Mike, and I think we've talked to you about this, was in effect this data lake idea where since our applications don't hold their own data, they call from a Central Lake and they're linked through API and they're Cloud-native.  It just makes it very easy to move data and you onboard a new client, it's not much different than is if we just got a couple of million new clients overnight. That -- and I make it sound very easy and all my technologists are ripping their hair off right now. But that's what we did, and it worked. The investment in that was everything from the Data Lake, to Cloud Native, to API and everything. And frankly to having businesses in technology  So technology at PNC is not in the back-office somewhere doing its job, they're actually side-by-side in an agile team working with their business partners to develop product, and importantly, to execute the conversion, which we did. That cultural element is probably as important, or more important, than all the rest.\nMike Mayo: So just in the final look at this, how many apps did you eventually keep from them, or how much in gigabytes did it add or just one more what you added?\nBill Demchak: Well we ended -- I think we ended up keeping 2 or something.\nMike Mayo: It was the last number, I think.\nBill Demchak: Yeah, one was the business transfer, you know, the personal foreign currency transfer business. I don't know what the other one was. And that's it.\nMike Mayo: And that was -- and I was trying to -- I have the numbers right. Was that out of 600 and you have 300 or something like that? And I mean, you thought this Company was much smaller.\nBill Demchak: We went through that before and I can't remember them off the top of my head, but they had twice the number that we have. That feels roughly --\nBryan Gill: 600. They had more than 600.\nBill Demchak: They had 600, we run the whole bank on 300.\nBryan Gill: A little more than 300.\nBill Demchak: Yeah. A little more, yeah. Why is -- why was that? I mean, that's the number that stands out. They're so much smaller, yet they had twice as many apps and we haven't got that state.I don't know. I mean, I think once you start using API-based programs, it's almost a click and drag, right? You don't have to recreate functionality across multiple applications. You can simply bring in whatever functionality you need from a library of API.  So let's say you have an application that just needs a checking account balance, rather than you write a full application that goes and finds a checking account balance off your core ledger, we just have an API you drag in and produce it. I think that's a big part of it. It's also credit to the team way back when we did National City, we moved everything onto a single application. A lot of times and BBVA might have done this, you'll do an acquisition, you just keep too many applications alive because you don't want to choose between one or between the two of them.\nMike Mayo: Got it. Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research, please go ahead with your question.\nJohn McDonald: Hi, good morning guys.\nRob Reilly: Hi John.\nJohn McDonald: PPP dynamics are confusing to all of us, and I just wanted to ask a little bit about that. So Rob, on the outlook, I think it's helpful that you give the core loan growth and it excludes PPP, but maybe you could give us a sense of what you expect for PPP payoffs in the fourth quarter and then beyond? And then also on NII, is PPP included in that, and what kind of PPP contribution have you had to NII this quarter? Sure.\nRob Reilly: What happened to that going forward? Yes. In simple terms, John, you're right it is confusing, but simply put, we expect PPP to be down on average about $4 billion in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter -- and net interest income contribution from PPP was about a $100 million, and we expect that to go down approximately 25 to 30, and that is in our guidance, our NII guidance.\nJohn McDonald: Yes. Okay, got you. Great. Another cleanup question here. On the securities -- redeployment of cash into securities, 25% to 30% is the target for this year. Over time and this could get into discussion that you had with Gerard about loan to deposits, but could that go higher over time? If loan growth doesn't surface as much as we think?\nBill Demchak: I think it could. I think that depends on  opportunity set, where the yield curve is, and how we think about long-term risk. Part of the issue today, John, is you have this long tail risk, maybe it's not such a long tail but that you end up with a spike in long rates because inflation becomes real. Which causes you at the margin to be slower than you otherwise might be in deploying that cash. I think as that risk normalizes if we don't see loan growth, you'll see balances increased.\nJohn McDonald: Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys.\nRob Reilly: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research, please go ahead with your question.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Good morning Bill and Rob.\nRob Reilly: Good morning.\nBill Carcache: Following up on Gerard 's question as we look ahead to spend tapering and eventually rate hikes, how are you thinking about deposit  relative to when we exited last reserve cycle?\nBill Demchak: I think they're going to be a lot lower simply because there's so much cash slash around. Remember even when the Fed tapers, they're not necessarily shrinking. And so with the cash in the system, that competition for deposits just won't be as great as it once was. So I think at the margin, they've got to be lower.\nRob Reilly: And another way of answering that, with all the deposits we have, we're not thinking a lot about , right?\nBill Carcache: Right. Yeah, that makes sense.\nRob Reilly: Yeah.\nBill Carcache: Understood. That's helpful. And I guess going back to the momentum you're seeing in new money commitments, what's your sense from your discussions with your customers of the extent to which utilization rates are going to remain relatively depressed as long as the supply chain problems that we're seeing remain unresolved versus the potential for continued improvement even if the supply chain problems were to extend well into next year say. Just had to get a feel for how big that -- how much of an impact it's having.\nBill Demchak: It varies across industries, they -- I shouldn't say without question, but the vast majority of our clients talk about the need and desire to build inventory and do more Capex, which is why some of the lines have been increasing. Their ability to execute on that is somewhat dependent on supply chain and it depends what industry you're in. If you're dependent on chips for your manufacturer, it's a struggle. Other businesses are not and could build immediately and maybe we are already seeing the benefit of that.\nBill Carcache: Got it. And if I can switch to BBVA in the revenue synergy opportunities, when you think about those, how does your confidence level around the timing and magnitude of realizing those differ relative to what you signed RBC? It seems you guys have the playbook, but just trying to get a sense for differences that you may see in execution this time around?\nRob Reilly: Hey, Bill, it's Rob. In terms of contracting with RBC, just set that aside, in terms of the BBVA, we're very confident in terms of the numbers as Bill mentioned that we've laid out and the plans to get there. It's probably on the increment better than RBC just because it's bigger. We know what we do, it's very familiar to , of course, RBC was successful, but this is --\nBill Demchak: I mean --\nRob Reilly: -- this is more magnitude.\nBill Demchak: Mike would say, would say -- Mike  who runs a CNIB business would say it's as much as, perhaps a year faster. And he gets there largely because the teams are in place much faster than we had them in place with RBC, and we'll see how that plays out, but we're hitting the ground faster in terms of teams who are out-calling on clients. And then we also have a book of business with BBVA that is better than what we had with RBC. So we have the ability to up-sell that book of business on the fee side, you'll remember us talking about just their percentage of fees to total revenue being very low. So we have an opportunity for fee momentum early on, we have teams in place and we ought to be able to grow clients a little bit faster than what we saw in RBC just because we're on the ground already.\nRob Reilly: That's the revenue aspect.\nBill Demchak: Yeah.\nRob Reilly: For the revenue aspect, if it is significantly higher than our RBC, the expense side, I thought was the question, the magnitude that I mentioned is the answer.\nBill Carcache: Understood. That's really helpful if I could squeeze in one last quick one Bill, you've talked about having teams inside of PNC studying crypto, and love to hear your thoughts on a couple of areas versus is there a revenue opportunity for PNC as you taken a poster, look at it, and then second, from a risk perspective, how concerned are you about the risk of. disruption from decentralized finance?\nBill Demchak: So what we talked about, or what we are contemplating offering, we literally have built today to our clients, and look, our clients are interested in it is an ability for them to trade crypto in a safe fashion through mobile app at PNC. I don't have to pine on whether I think that's a good investment or not a bad investment, we know with certainty that we have 10% to 15% of our clients who are moving money into and out of Crypto exchanges. So they're interested in it, and our surveys confirm that. The financial disruption of Crypto broadly and probably inside of that stable coin, is a real threat and it depends on how that plays out through time.  There's the risk I think that people are aware of with certain of the stable coins having, let's call it suspicious collateral behind them. But there is also the risk through time that a substantial portion of savings -- either domestic savings or even emerging market savings, get absorbed into a stable coin and not of the traditional money transmission system. And that would affect the economy and the ability to control the money supply long term. And I think that's what -- I know that's what the various regulatory bodies are looking at to figure out how to get their arms around. But that's independent of whether we let our clients trade .\nRob Reilly: Right.\nBill Carcache: Yeah. There is a revenue opportunity from that portion of it, even by simply just providing the service to them. So is that a fair conclusion?\nBill Demchak: Sure. I mean, at the margin, I -- at the margin.\nRob Reilly: Don't see it as a big driver.\nBill Carcache: Right, got it. That's super helpful. Thank you again for taking my questions.\nRob Reilly: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies, please go ahead.\nKen Usdin: Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. Can I come back, Rob, on the premium amortization question? I'm just wondering if you can help us understand in the 1.45 for securities yield, what either the basis point impact was, or if you even have total dollars of premium aim for the Company and what you expect that to look like going forward?\nRob Reilly: But that's all in our guidance in terms of the dollar amounts. But I'd say if you took a look at it in terms of the yields, you can see the decline in yields. If it wasn't for the elevated premium amortization expense, we would be close to down a little bit from those second-quarter levels.\nKen Usdin: Okay. That's fair. And that was my second question is, what are you seeing just on core front book, back book, and relative to these forward saddling s and just what you're seeing in the market today and where you get your hands on?\nRob Reilly: Well, it's looking better is what we said relative to the --\nBill Demchak: Yields were buying today but we expect the yield on the total book to increase pretty substantially next quarter largely because of it's decrease in the amortization costs.\nRob Reilly: That's right.\nKen Usdin: Yes. And then lastly, just purchase accounting accretion, you said it was 30 in the second -quarter. Do you have anything in the third? And how do you expect that to look like to \nRob Reilly: The max -- the  in the third and going into the fourth quarter. Which is a good thing.\nKen Usdin: Yeah. Okay. Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens, please go ahead.\nTerry McEvoy: Thanks. Good morning. Bill, you mentioned in an industry event last month that California was an underperforming franchise, I believe at Legacy BBVA U.S. What are your thoughts on turning that around? Is it build, is it buy or is it just internally work to improve the franchise?\nBill Demchak: It's building and I mean, it was underperforming largely because they didn't have the products and services to cover the corporate opportunity that's in California. And by the way, that opportunities massive. So the big effort for us and we're fairly far along in the process is to get feet on the ground on the corporate side, who can cover clients and, in some cases, bring relationships with them. So we don't need to buy anything, at the margin, we might rearrange some of the branches there. But the real opportunity set in California is to get corporate bankers and TM coverage and capital markets players on the ground in California.\nRob Reilly: Which in many instances we've done already.\nBill Demchak: Yeah.\nTerry McEvoy: Thanks. And then just as a follow-up question, could you maybe talk about the roll-out of low cash mode? Is that allowing you to play more offense or is that more defense? And then is that being it 125 to 150 the decline in overdraft fees, is that still the right way to think about the impact of that product on fees? Thank you.\nBill Demchak: So the rollout has been somewhat seamless and of course, we just -- with the conversion of BBVA, we've put all of their customers or enabled that low cash mode on all other products who converted over. I forget the current stats, but it's millions and millions and millions of alerts that have gone out. It's millions of people who have been able to transfer money before they get hit with a charge. Its people being able to choose the order at which  want to pay a bill and return items with no return fee. And we -- in some ways, we lead the industry into this discussion and you've seen how people have reacted.  Part of our lead was in what we charge customers, but a big part of our lead was on technology, in simply empowering customers and most everyone who has followed is kind of doing it through brute force and just cutting fees, as opposed to offering different solutions, which is the most important thing about low cash mode, I think. We're happy with what it's doing. It's not our complaint volume into the Care Center down by -- I don't know what the number is on overdraft, over 50% or something.\nRob Reilly: Yeah. On overdraft even higher than that.\nBill Demchak: Yeah. So it's done exactly what we thought it would do.\nTerry McEvoy: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatt O'Connor: Good morning. It seems like the loan portfolio at BBVA USA will be mostly de-register runoff by the end of 4Q if we're just a couple of billion less the next 2 years, is there an opportunity to fill that bucket relatively quickly? I guess what I'm getting at is maybe you can take down bigger holds because you're a bigger Company versus Legacy PNC or just some low-hanging fruit to fill some of that loan runoff between this quarter and next?\nBill Demchak: It's embedded in our guidance. I mean, you got appreciate Matt, we're not -- if loans are up or down by a billion in a quarter, we're not going to putty over the organic result by doing something we otherwise wouldn't do. It will follow its ordinary flow. We'll grow clients. We are a larger Company so we can take larger holds if we want to. Utilization hopefully goes up. And as we always do, we're sensitive to risk and they have some folks of business that are both in some cases riskier than we'd like to be in. And in other cases, they just have no cross-sell opportunity and so the return on the equity you deployed to hold those loans is just really low.\nRob Reilly: But I would add, Matt, I mean, obviously central premise is acquisition, these are growth markets, so we would expect through time to generate above-average growth, not necessarily in the next 90 days, but that's obviously a big opportunity for us.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay, yeah. And I wasn't so much looking for just a fourth-quarter, I guess, I was just thinking the next few quarters do you get outsized loan growth given \nBill Demchak: If we get a tailwind at all, you're definitely going to see that. And I think and most importantly, if you go back and look at our loan growth through the period of RBC, so kind of 2 plus years after we did RBC, we started to really accelerate the corporate loan growth. And every you said, how are you doing that? It's all new customers and new markets, and we fully expect that we're going to be able to do that. And all of these new markets that we were just developed. Admittedly with some noise in the front because we're going to run off a little bit out of BBVA and outright loan growth is, as we've seen, fairly tepid at the moment.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our next question is a follow-up from Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Please go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Hi. Thank you for taking the follow-up question. I'm feeling -- you guys mentioned about raising the entry-level wage or minimum wage for your folks. Some of your peers have done the same, excuse me, Bank of Montreal raised their wages 20% last week, and Bank of America has got that 25 and 25 program. So the question is this, can you share with us what it means for the people right above the entry-level -- excuse me, in the entry-level, worker, meaning like a branch manager, how far up does that ripple go in terms of the inflation on wages because of the minimum wage going up?\nBill Demchak: It goes straight up through the pay grades. Most of the cost is actually in the compression, as opposed to the initial jump for the people who are at the lowest level. So a part of the work set to go through this to figure out, in fact, how you move people up who are today at 18, but tomorrow -- if the $15 person went to 18, the $18 person goes to 20-50 or some -- and I'm making up numbers here, but that's the majority of the cost. And by the way, it's a majority of the work set to get right.\nGerard Cassidy: Good. Okay. No, I appreciate it. Thank you.\nBill Demchak: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Hi. Can you put a ribbon around your expectations for loan growth? That seems to be like the big question you going into the quarter. And in the past, you mentioned over half your commercial clients are private companies which don't have the same access to capital markets, and therefore, they might come back first. So just one final thought on loan growth, when do you think we get the big burst of loan growth? Is it a quarter away, is it three quarters away? Is it a year away? What do you think and why?\nBill Demchak: You know Mike, I think you asked me this 9 months ago. And I said I can wish and hope for it, but I'm not sure I can predict it any better than the next guy. What we're seeing for the first time, right, is not just the new money going out the door, which we've been growing clients and growing committed money. But we're starting to see them move in utilization. And if that is foreshadowing what happens into the fourth quarter into next year, then we're going to have really accelerated loan grown. If we bounce around where we are, then it's going to be somewhat muted. And by the way, that's what you see in our guidance. It's far --\nMike Mayo: And I know you said it was the --\nBill Demchak: It's kind of -- you're asking me to go out and say, hey, supply chain is going to be fixed, and loan growth is going to rip and I hope --\nRob Reilly: By a given date.\nBill Demchak: And I hope it does, but I'm not the expert to answer that.\nMike Mayo: Okay. Well, maybe just specific numbers in the utilization a little bit more, your kind is at the highest level since the early last year or so, but what's a normal level of utilization? What was the level and where is it now?\nBill Demchak: It's still what, 15 points.\nRob Reilly: If you go -- correct 49 - ish, and at a 54-55 sort of normalization.\nBill Demchak: So, at least 10 points off and we're probably 15/20 points off the peak in March of last year? There's a lot of room here.\nOperator: All right. Thank you. There are no further questions.\nBryan Gill: All right, well thank you, everybody. I look forward to talking to you in the fourth quarter. Thanks.\nRob Reilly: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may not disconnect.",

            "name": "Rob Reilly",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill just mentioned, and notable during the third quarter, we converted the BBVA USA franchise to the PNC platform in less than 11 months following the announcement of the deal. PNC's increased scale from this acquisition underscores the opportunity we have with the BBVA USA franchise. We have a proven track record of acquiring attractive strategic opportunities, identifying and reducing inherent risks, and successfully growing franchises to deliver enhanced shareholder value. And as Bill just mentioned, we're well on our way to accomplishing this with BBVA USA. Due to the June 1 closing of the acquisition, our average balance sheet growth for the third quarter reflected the full quarter impact of the acquisition. As loans grew $36 billion, securities increased $12 billion, and deposits grew $53 billion. For comparative purposes for the second quarter, which you'll recall included just one month of BBVA USA results, our balance sheet on Slide 3 is presented on a spot basis. Total spot loans declined $4.5 billion or 2% linked-quarter, excluding the impact of PPP forgiveness, loans grew. And I'll cover the drivers in more detail over the next few slides. Investment securities declined approximately $900 million or 1%, as we slowed purchase activity throughout much of the quarter during the relatively unattractive rate environment. Our cash balances at the Federal Reserve continued to grow and ended the third quarter at $75 billion. On a liability side, deposit balances were $449 billion on September 30th and declined $4 billion reflecting the repositioning of certain BBVA USA portfolios. We ended the quarter with a tangible book value of $94.82 per share and an estimated CET1 ratio of 10.2%. Both are substantially above the pro forma levels we anticipated at the time of the deal announcement. During the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders with common dividends of $537 million and share repurchases of $393 million. Given our strong capital ratios, we continue to be well-positioned with significant capital flexibility going forward. Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Average loans increased $36 billion linked quarter to $291 billion, reflecting the full quarter impact of the acquisition. Taking a closer look at the linked quarter change in our spot balances, total loans declined $4.5 billion. The PNC legacy portfolio, excluding PPP loans, grew by $4.7 billion or 2%, with growth in both commercial and consumer loans. PNC Legacy Commercial loans grew $3.7 billion, driven by growth within Corporate Banking and asset-based lending. The stroke in balances has been aided by a slight uptake in spot utilization. And while still near historic lows, utilization did reach its highest level since December 2020. Growth in PNC's Legacy Consumer loans linked quarter was driven by higher residential real estate balances. Within the BBVA USA portfolio, loans declined $4.4 billion primarily due to intentional run-off relating to the overlapping exposures of the non-strategic loans. Looking ahead, we have approximately $5 billion of additional BBVA USA loans that we intend to let roll off over the next few years, which is in line with our acquisition assumptions. Finally, PPP loans declined $4.8 billion due to forgiveness activity. And as of September 30th, $6.8 billion of PPP loans remained on our balance sheet. Moving to Slide 5, average deposits of $454 billion increased $53 billion compared to the second quarter, driven by the acquisition. On the right, you can see total period-end deposits were $449 billion on September 30, a decline of $4 billion, or 1% linked-quarter. Inside of this PNC legacy deposits increased $5.4 billion, as deposits continued to grow, reflecting the strong liquidity position of our customers. BBVA USA deposits declined approximately $9.4 billion during the third quarter, which was anticipated as we rationalized the rate paid on certain acquired commercial deposit portfolios and exited several non-core deposit-related businesses. Overall our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits is now 4 basis points or 1 basis point decline linked-quarter. Slide 6 details the change in our period and securities and Federal Reserve balances. And as most of you know, we have been disciplined in deploying our excess liquidity with rates at historically low levels. Back to the beginning of the year as the yield curve steepened, we accelerated our rate of purchasing activity. However, towards the end of the second quarter, we deliberately slowed our purchases as yields declined. With the increase in rates at the end of the third quarter, we've resumed our increased levels of purchasing, including $5.4 billion of forward-settling securities, which will be reflected in the fourth quarter. Average security balances now represent approximately 24% of interest-earning assets, and we still expect to be in the range of approximately 25 to 30% by year-end. As you can see on Slide 7, our third quarter Income Statement includes the full quarter impact of the acquisition. The reported EPS was $3.30, which included pretax integration costs of $243 million. Excluding integration costs adjusted, EPS was $3.75. Third-quarter revenue was up 11% compared with the second quarter, reflecting the acquisition as well as strong organic fee growth. Expenses increased $537 million or 18% linked quarter, including $235 million of integration expenses, and 2 additional months of BBVA USA operating expenses. Legacy PNC expenses increased $76 million or 2.7%, virtually, all of which was driven by higher fee business activity. Pre-tax, pre-provision earnings, excluding integration costs, were $1.9 billion $25 million, or 7%. The provision re-capture of $203 million was primarily driven by improved credit quality and changes in portfolio composition and our effective tax rate was 17.8%. For the full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 17%. As a result, total Net Income was $1.5 billion in the third quarter. Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to slide 8, these charts illustrate our diversified business mix. In total, the revenue of $5.2 billion increased by $530 million linked quarter. Net interest income of $2.9 billion was up $275 million or 11%, reflecting the full quarter benefit of the earning asset balances acquired from BBVA USA. Inside of that, interest income on loans increased $277 million or 13% while investment securities income declined $9 million, driven by elevated premium amortization on the acquired BBVA USA portfolio. A net interest margin of 2.27% was down 2 basis points, driven primarily by lower security yields. Importantly in the fourth quarter, we expect premium amortization to decline meaningfully and the yield on the securities portfolio to increase. The third quarter fee income of $1.9 billion, increased $274 million or 17% linked-quarter. BBVA USA contributed a fee income of $184 million, an increase of a $122 million linked quarter, driven by two additional months of operating results. Legacy PNC fees grew by a $152 million linked quarter or 10% driven by higher corporate service fees related to recording M&A advisory activity, as well as growth in residential mortgage revenue. Other non-interest income of $449 million decreased $19 million linked quarter as higher private equity revenue was more than offset by the impact of a $169 million negative Visa derivative adjustment. This adjustment relates to the extension of the expected timing of litigation resolution. Turning to slide 9, our third quarter expenses were up by $537 million or 18% linked-quarter. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of higher BBVA USA expenses of $327 million and higher integration expenses of $134 million. PNC Legacy expenses increased $76 million or 2.7% due to higher incentive compensation commensurate with a strong performance in our fee businesses, including a record quarter in M&A advisory fees. Our efficiency ratio adjusted for integration costs was 64%. Obviously, with the acquisition, our expense base is now higher but nevertheless, we remain disciplined around our expense management. And as we've stated previously, we have a goal to reduce PNC standalone expenses by $300 million in 2021, through our Continuous improvement program and we're on track to achieve our full-year target. Additionally, we're confident we'll realize the full $900 million in net expense savings off of our forecasts of BBVA U.S.A.'s 2022 expense base, and expect virtually all of the actions that drive the $900 million of savings to be completed by the end of 2021. We still expect to incur integration costs of approximately $980 million related to the acquisition. Since the announcement of the acquisition, we have incurred approximately half of these integration costs. And as Bill mentioned, we appreciate all the hard work our teammates have done to keep us on track and to achieve these goals. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 10 and reflect strong credit performance. Non-performing loans of $2.5 billion decreased $251 million or 9% compared to June 30th, and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies of $1.4 billion on September 30th increased a $106 million or 8%. However, this increase includes approximately $75 million of operational delays in early-stage delinquencies primarily related to BBVA USA acquired loans. Subsequent to quarter-end, all of these operational delinquencies have been or are in the process of being resolved. Excluding these, total delinquencies would have increased $31 million or 2%. Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $81 million, a decline of $225 million linked quarter. The second quarter included $248 million of charge-offs related to BBVA USA loans, mostly the result of required purchase accounting and treatment for the acquisition. Our annualized net charge-offs, loans in the third quarter were 11 basis points. During the third quarter, our allowance for credit losses declined $374 million, primarily driven by improvement in credit quality, as well as changes in portfolio composition. At quarter-end, our reserves were $6 billion representing 2.07% of loans. In summary, PNC reported a strong third quarter, and notably, earlier this week converted the BBVA USA franchise. With this step completed, we expect to add significant value to our shareholders as we continue to realize the potential of the combined Company. In regard to our view of the overall economy, after somewhat slower growth during the third quarter of 2021 due in part to the Delta variant and supply chain problems, we expect GDP to accelerate to above 6% annualized in the fourth quarter. We also expect the Fed funds rate to remain near zero for the remainder of the year. Looking at the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the recent third-quarter results, we expect average loan balances, excluding PPP, to be up modestly. We expect NII to be up modestly. On a percentage basis, we expect fee income to be down between 3% and 5%, mostly reflecting the elevated third quarter M&A activity. We expect other non-interest income to be between $375 and $425 million excluding net securities and fees activity. On a percent, we expect the total non-interest expense to be down between 3% and 5% excluding integration expense, which we approximate to be $450 million during the fourth quarter. And we expect fourth-quarter net charge-offs to be between $100 and $150 million. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions. Good morning, Dave. Sure. Again, good morning, Dave. So of the 5 billion that we've identified going forward that we intend to run off, 2 billion of that we expect to run off in the fourth quarter, and that's part of our guidance. The remainder, likely over the next couple of years. Sure. And then -- and as you know, Dave, as we've mentioned, that utilization kicked up a little bit. Still at historic lows, but a little bit, and that was part of it too. Good morning, John. A little bit, yeah. Yeah, so basically business credit, or asset-based lending group and corporate banking. $18 an hour. And to offset what is real in terms of wage pressure. Sure. So that's a lot there, Scott, but the easy answer to that is that's all in the guidance for the fourth quarter. So we -- to your point, fee businesses have been -- were good in the third quarter, they've been good all year. Across-the-board Asset Management, Consumer Services, Corporate Services, particularly in the third quarter, as well as Residential Mortgage. And with the exception of the elevated levels of M&A activity in Corporate Services, we see all of that continuing into the fourth quarter and that's part of the guide. So there'll be expenses that are obviously associated with that. In terms of the 900 million in savings, we are achieving savings. Presently, we got some in the third quarter, we'll get some more in the fourth quarter. That's part of the guide, but the bulk of the savings will be in 2022. So reaffirming the 900 million in savings, a portion of which we'll recognize in 2021, and then of course going forward into 2022, all in our guidance. And it was a function of the timing of the acquisition, setting up those securities as premium securities. That's right. That happens, yeah. That's right, which is what I said in my comments. That's right. It is acquisition-related. Morning Betsy. No. No. You're right. Hey, Betsy, this is Rob, but you're right. We've started, as we said, we would so we have begun to realize expense savings pretty much across all the categories. But we're just getting started so what you see in that , we still have work to go. Yeah, right. Like when you talk about the activities and then like -- I think that's right. And probably at least in terms of the pickup in the fourth-quarter activity, we will -- at the mix, we will pick up more vendor savings. We've already started that and we will start to pick those up but at an accelerated rate. Yeah, and I just see it. I see it. I just think I think the way to think about it, Betsy, is its sequential. So that conversion in the lifted shift creates a deck, so to speak, to get started sooner rather than later on realizing those savings. That's right. Well -- yeah. No. I know the -- let's say, I'll do the quick math in my head down 25%. 85, yeah 85 to 90. Hi, Mike. And the 900, you know that, Mike. The 900 was estimated off the expectation that we convert and when we did. So, we didn't convert sooner than we thought, we did it on time. Hi John. What happened to that going forward? Yes. In simple terms, John, you're right it is confusing, but simply put, we expect PPP to be down on average about $4 billion in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter -- and net interest income contribution from PPP was about a $100 million, and we expect that to go down approximately 25 to 30, and that is in our guidance, our NII guidance. Sure. Good morning. And another way of answering that, with all the deposits we have, we're not thinking a lot about , right? Yeah. Hey, Bill, it's Rob. In terms of contracting with RBC, just set that aside, in terms of the BBVA, we're very confident in terms of the numbers as Bill mentioned that we've laid out and the plans to get there. It's probably on the increment better than RBC just because it's bigger. We know what we do, it's very familiar to , of course, RBC was successful, but this is -- -- this is more magnitude. That's the revenue aspect. For the revenue aspect, if it is significantly higher than our RBC, the expense side, I thought was the question, the magnitude that I mentioned is the answer. Right. Don't see it as a big driver. Sure. But that's all in our guidance in terms of the dollar amounts. But I'd say if you took a look at it in terms of the yields, you can see the decline in yields. If it wasn't for the elevated premium amortization expense, we would be close to down a little bit from those second-quarter levels. Well, it's looking better is what we said relative to the -- That's right. The max -- the  in the third and going into the fourth quarter. Which is a good thing. Which in many instances we've done already. Yeah. On overdraft even higher than that. But I would add, Matt, I mean, obviously central premise is acquisition, these are growth markets, so we would expect through time to generate above-average growth, not necessarily in the next 90 days, but that's obviously a big opportunity for us. By a given date. If you go -- correct 49 - ish, and at a 54-55 sort of normalization. Thank you."

            "name": "Bill Demchak",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everybody. I imagine you have seen that earlier this week we completed our conversion of BBVA USA, and I got to say I'm really proud of the team and our ability to sign, close, and convert a $100 billion banking institution within a year. The dedication of our employees and our sustained investments in technology allowed us to convert roughly 9,000 employees, 2.6 million customers, and nearly 600 branches across 7 states. BBVA USA is now integrated into PNC and its customers can bank with us from coast to coast. We're bringing our technology talent and the full suite of best-in-class products and services to 29 of the nation's 30 largest markets. with attractive growth opportunities as you've heard me talk about for years to come. Now while we still have some more work to do, which is to be expected for bank conversion of this site, we're making solid progress with our staffing levels and the branch operations, and BBVA USA legacy markets. In addition, we're encouraged to see the teams build pipelines and importantly, growing new clients. That was BBVA legacy employees now on PNC systems, we believe our momentum is going to continue to accelerate as we previously, we're following the same game plan that we've used in previous acquisitions. And we know what to do and we just have to execute on it. With respect to our third-quarter results, we had a solid quarter highlighted by strong revenue growth, which included record fee income in our PNC legacy businesses, and continued improvements in credit quality, similar to last quarter and pretty much as expected, we had a lot of moving parts on our reported results. And of course, Rob will take you through those in a few minutes. Loan growth continues to be impacted by supply chain issues and the continued runoff of PPP loans and also, the strategic repositioning of the BBVA portfolio so which is consistent with our acquisition projections. That said, total PNC legacy loans if we backup the PPP runoff, actually grew almost 5 billion with growth in both Commercial and Consumer categories. And while the environment is still challenging, we're actually pretty encouraged by what we're seeing on the corporate side with spot utilization rates stabilizing and even rising a little on the back of strong new originations and our secured lending and corporate banking businesses. And on the consumer side, we're also seeing promising origination activity, particularly in the residential real estate business. Importantly, and as you see our balance sheet remains very strong and we're well-positioned with substantial capital and liquidity to continue to support our expanded customer base while making strategic investments in our technology and businesses. Another exciting development this quarter was the announcement of our integration with a clear data access network. This is through an application programming interface. The integration is going to allow millions of our customers, if they choose to do so, to safely share their financial information with FinTechs and data aggregators. It's an important step in our efforts to help our customers protect their data. We're also giving them the choice to share their data with third-party applications. Similar to low cash mode, this integration positions us as a leader in technology and innovation and enables us to best serve our customers. And I'd like to close just by thanking our employees throughout the newly-combined franchise for all their hard work, which enabled this conversion. A significant collaboration across all divisions is impressive and it gives me great confidence that we'll capitalize on the enormous opportunities ahead of us. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our results, and then we'll take your questions. Hi, it's Bill. We've been, for the last couple of quarters, our new money commitments have been, I think maybe at record levels, Rob, but increasing each quarter. And so new business, new clients, in some cases just upsizing what we already had. And then quarter, we had a little bit utilization, but most of this was kind of new client growth. Right. Sure. Yeah, they're kind of related, I mean, the growth in our secured lending areas stood out and they traditionally have higher utilization, so in some ways, it was an increase in the overall average because we grew the book with the highest individual average rate. But even in the straight middle-market corporate book, it finally stabilized, and I guess went up a couple of basis points there as well. With respect to wage inflation, you might have seen an announcement that we increased our base rate to at least 18 and beyond that, in some cases in certain markets. So it -- Yes, sorry. And so that is real, but that was already assumed in our financial assumptions. It doesn't have anything to do with our recent cost saves. But there's real pressure there and the only way through time to offset that pressure is through increased automation and then just frankly control on overall headcount. Too early to tell, right? We're on this -- so average wages per employee are going to go up. The issue is how quickly we -- how we scale our franchise through automation so we become larger without more employees. And that's played out for a period of time here, John. if you just go through our financial statements, even going back for five years. We just need to continue that trend to be able to continue our pursuit of positive operating leverage. Yeah. It was painful. In its simplest form, we marked that securities book when we closed the deal, at really low rates that then continued through -- in fact, rallied through the quarter. So the prepay rates on their CMOs increase, and we had -- so you think about it, we mark a book to whatever the yield was, it's at a premium. All of that prepays because of the low rates, hopefully, we expect that to abate as rates have now going back up. But we mark them as premium securities and then got caught by the -- In its simplest form, what we did if you think about it, is it knocked down goodwill in the way when we marked a book because we had a higher-valued asset. So, it, in fact, took in Income upfront and pay for it a little bit this quarter. I mean, Rob the securities yield once the guide on the -- like that book yielded 50 basis points or something. Yeah. And it is. And we expect going forward the total book to increase. Yeah, and it was painful. I don't even know what to talk about. I mean -- Line items? I mean, we have -- Some of its branch closures -- some of it will be in the form of people who have stayed with us through conversion on stay bonuses. There will be shutdown of systems and vendor contracts and all sorts of different things that will roll through dependent on time. Some of which we leave around for a bit as backup for -- notwithstanding the fact we've converted, we'll leave some stuff up and running for a little bit of time just for the in-case. It gives -- that's the wrong way to think about it. The fact that we get that done at one point in time allows us to then aggressively move costs. Because Legacy System shutdown, Legacy Vendor shutdown, related people who are supporting old applications, all of that stuff now starts rolling through the system. Yes. And you know that -- look, at the end of the day the guidance is the guidance, right? We're going to get some more in the fourth quarter and then we're going to get it all next year. We're on track. We will get it all. We know the line items where it will come from. Hey, Gerard. Look, in its simplest form, you set a record, you assume you won't keep setting records. There's nothing out there that suggests necessarily that it's going to weaken from here. But by the way, inside of that, we obviously have , but we also had breakout quarters for Solebury and  and related advisors. If the market continues, that will continue to have great fee income out of it, but it's hard to keep, say we're going to budget or record upon a record. I think it's as simple as that. There's too many variables. I mean, if you go back in history, right? People would operate, I don't know where we were, 80%, 85%. And that was kind of a liquidity safety function. So if you were short liquidity at that point, you'd raise wholesale liquidity to kind of keep your ratio at that point. Today, we're so flush with reserves into the system, wholesale funding is next to 0, and until the Fed -- forget about tapering, actually shrinks its balance sheet, that's not going to change. Now, loan growth even accelerated, and exaggerated loan growth will absorb some of that. But I think you're going to see in loan to deposit ratios low for a long period of time. And therefore, I think you're going to see security balances as a percentage of the balance sheet and we've already talked about this increase across the industry. And that's going to -- I think it's going to take years to play out. Yeah. Hi, Mike. Well look, with the first question. At the end of the day, we're always in the business of figuring out how to become more efficient. I think of the 900 is line items we know we can get. We actually know where they're coming from and when they're going to show up. So you're right at the margin we'll find some other stuff. By the way, we'll probably find some stuff we need to invest in too. So we just put that into our guidance. We say \"Look, we'll get the 900. \" We'll talk to you about '22 when we get closer but we haven't lost focus on the primary objective. So but that's -- but there was a number that -- how to say this, visual until we can see it. We know the line items, it's very precise. The technology, look, it worked. We had at the margin, some confusion with retail clients on password resets and some other things, but the basic technology moving it overturned it on, it all worked. It's this just phenomenal effort by our team and validates the investment we've made over the years. I don't know what people have or don't have in terms of their ability to do that, but the biggest element for us, Mike, and I think we've talked to you about this, was in effect this data lake idea where since our applications don't hold their own data, they call from a Central Lake and they're linked through API and they're Cloud-native.  It just makes it very easy to move data and you onboard a new client, it's not much different than is if we just got a couple of million new clients overnight. That -- and I make it sound very easy and all my technologists are ripping their hair off right now. But that's what we did, and it worked. The investment in that was everything from the Data Lake, to Cloud Native, to API and everything. And frankly to having businesses in technology  So technology at PNC is not in the back-office somewhere doing its job, they're actually side-by-side in an agile team working with their business partners to develop product, and importantly, to execute the conversion, which we did. That cultural element is probably as important, or more important, than all the rest. Well we ended -- I think we ended up keeping 2 or something. Yeah, one was the business transfer, you know, the personal foreign currency transfer business. I don't know what the other one was. And that's it. We went through that before and I can't remember them off the top of my head, but they had twice the number that we have. That feels roughly -- They had 600, we run the whole bank on 300. Yeah. A little more, yeah. Why is -- why was that? I mean, that's the number that stands out. They're so much smaller, yet they had twice as many apps and we haven't got that state.I don't know. I mean, I think once you start using API-based programs, it's almost a click and drag, right? You don't have to recreate functionality across multiple applications. You can simply bring in whatever functionality you need from a library of API.  So let's say you have an application that just needs a checking account balance, rather than you write a full application that goes and finds a checking account balance off your core ledger, we just have an API you drag in and produce it. I think that's a big part of it. It's also credit to the team way back when we did National City, we moved everything onto a single application. A lot of times and BBVA might have done this, you'll do an acquisition, you just keep too many applications alive because you don't want to choose between one or between the two of them. I think it could. I think that depends on  opportunity set, where the yield curve is, and how we think about long-term risk. Part of the issue today, John, is you have this long tail risk, maybe it's not such a long tail but that you end up with a spike in long rates because inflation becomes real. Which causes you at the margin to be slower than you otherwise might be in deploying that cash. I think as that risk normalizes if we don't see loan growth, you'll see balances increased. I think they're going to be a lot lower simply because there's so much cash slash around. Remember even when the Fed tapers, they're not necessarily shrinking. And so with the cash in the system, that competition for deposits just won't be as great as it once was. So I think at the margin, they've got to be lower. It varies across industries, they -- I shouldn't say without question, but the vast majority of our clients talk about the need and desire to build inventory and do more Capex, which is why some of the lines have been increasing. Their ability to execute on that is somewhat dependent on supply chain and it depends what industry you're in. If you're dependent on chips for your manufacturer, it's a struggle. Other businesses are not and could build immediately and maybe we are already seeing the benefit of that. I mean -- Mike would say, would say -- Mike  who runs a CNIB business would say it's as much as, perhaps a year faster. And he gets there largely because the teams are in place much faster than we had them in place with RBC, and we'll see how that plays out, but we're hitting the ground faster in terms of teams who are out-calling on clients. And then we also have a book of business with BBVA that is better than what we had with RBC. So we have the ability to up-sell that book of business on the fee side, you'll remember us talking about just their percentage of fees to total revenue being very low. So we have an opportunity for fee momentum early on, we have teams in place and we ought to be able to grow clients a little bit faster than what we saw in RBC just because we're on the ground already. Yeah. So what we talked about, or what we are contemplating offering, we literally have built today to our clients, and look, our clients are interested in it is an ability for them to trade crypto in a safe fashion through mobile app at PNC. I don't have to pine on whether I think that's a good investment or not a bad investment, we know with certainty that we have 10% to 15% of our clients who are moving money into and out of Crypto exchanges. So they're interested in it, and our surveys confirm that. The financial disruption of Crypto broadly and probably inside of that stable coin, is a real threat and it depends on how that plays out through time.  There's the risk I think that people are aware of with certain of the stable coins having, let's call it suspicious collateral behind them. But there is also the risk through time that a substantial portion of savings -- either domestic savings or even emerging market savings, get absorbed into a stable coin and not of the traditional money transmission system. And that would affect the economy and the ability to control the money supply long term. And I think that's what -- I know that's what the various regulatory bodies are looking at to figure out how to get their arms around. But that's independent of whether we let our clients trade . Sure. I mean, at the margin, I -- at the margin. Yields were buying today but we expect the yield on the total book to increase pretty substantially next quarter largely because of it's decrease in the amortization costs. It's building and I mean, it was underperforming largely because they didn't have the products and services to cover the corporate opportunity that's in California. And by the way, that opportunities massive. So the big effort for us and we're fairly far along in the process is to get feet on the ground on the corporate side, who can cover clients and, in some cases, bring relationships with them. So we don't need to buy anything, at the margin, we might rearrange some of the branches there. But the real opportunity set in California is to get corporate bankers and TM coverage and capital markets players on the ground in California. Yeah. So the rollout has been somewhat seamless and of course, we just -- with the conversion of BBVA, we've put all of their customers or enabled that low cash mode on all other products who converted over. I forget the current stats, but it's millions and millions and millions of alerts that have gone out. It's millions of people who have been able to transfer money before they get hit with a charge. Its people being able to choose the order at which  want to pay a bill and return items with no return fee. And we -- in some ways, we lead the industry into this discussion and you've seen how people have reacted.  Part of our lead was in what we charge customers, but a big part of our lead was on technology, in simply empowering customers and most everyone who has followed is kind of doing it through brute force and just cutting fees, as opposed to offering different solutions, which is the most important thing about low cash mode, I think. We're happy with what it's doing. It's not our complaint volume into the Care Center down by -- I don't know what the number is on overdraft, over 50% or something. Yeah. So it's done exactly what we thought it would do. It's embedded in our guidance. I mean, you got appreciate Matt, we're not -- if loans are up or down by a billion in a quarter, we're not going to putty over the organic result by doing something we otherwise wouldn't do. It will follow its ordinary flow. We'll grow clients. We are a larger Company so we can take larger holds if we want to. Utilization hopefully goes up. And as we always do, we're sensitive to risk and they have some folks of business that are both in some cases riskier than we'd like to be in. And in other cases, they just have no cross-sell opportunity and so the return on the equity you deployed to hold those loans is just really low. If we get a tailwind at all, you're definitely going to see that. And I think and most importantly, if you go back and look at our loan growth through the period of RBC, so kind of 2 plus years after we did RBC, we started to really accelerate the corporate loan growth. And every you said, how are you doing that? It's all new customers and new markets, and we fully expect that we're going to be able to do that. And all of these new markets that we were just developed. Admittedly with some noise in the front because we're going to run off a little bit out of BBVA and outright loan growth is, as we've seen, fairly tepid at the moment. It goes straight up through the pay grades. Most of the cost is actually in the compression, as opposed to the initial jump for the people who are at the lowest level. So a part of the work set to go through this to figure out, in fact, how you move people up who are today at 18, but tomorrow -- if the $15 person went to 18, the $18 person goes to 20-50 or some -- and I'm making up numbers here, but that's the majority of the cost. And by the way, it's a majority of the work set to get right. Yeah. You know Mike, I think you asked me this 9 months ago. And I said I can wish and hope for it, but I'm not sure I can predict it any better than the next guy. What we're seeing for the first time, right, is not just the new money going out the door, which we've been growing clients and growing committed money. But we're starting to see them move in utilization. And if that is foreshadowing what happens into the fourth quarter into next year, then we're going to have really accelerated loan grown. If we bounce around where we are, then it's going to be somewhat muted. And by the way, that's what you see in our guidance. It's far -- It's kind of -- you're asking me to go out and say, hey, supply chain is going to be fixed, and loan growth is going to rip and I hope -- And I hope it does, but I'm not the expert to answer that. It's still what, 15 points. So, at least 10 points off and we're probably 15/20 points off the peak in March of last year? There's a lot of room here."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Pama, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PNC Financial Services Group Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. . As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bryan Gill. Sir, please go ahead.\nBryan Gill: Well, thank you Pama, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nBill Demchak: Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you\u2019ve seen, we accomplished a lot in the second quarter and most important was the closing of the acquisition of BBVA USA on June 1. Obviously this created a fair amount of noise in our reported results adding one month of BBVA USA operating results and the impact of purchase accounting adjustments as well as merger-related impacts. Rob's going to take you through all of that in a couple of minutes, but putting those things aside, we had a pretty good quarter driven by solid net interest income, strong fee growth,, continued improvements in credit quality and announcement of higher capital returns. While loans increased primarily due to the acquisition, we did have spot loan growth from both consumer and C&I in the legacy PNC balance sheet. We've seen loan utilization rate stabilized within our corporate institutional banking business. However, they remain near historic lows and while new loan approvals have rebounded actually to the highest level in a couple of years that's been offset by continued pay downs. Within the legacy -- within the PNC legacy consumer book, we saw loans grow in the quarter, which was encouraging and we're confident that strong economic growth is ultimately going to drive strong loan growth, but it remains an open debate as to the timing of that loan growth relative to the second half of '21 and into '22. During the quarter, we continued to deploy excess liquidity through $10 billion of net security purchases. Going forward and considering the significant recent rally in treasuries will be disciplined as we look to reduce our elevated cash position. You saw that our results underscore the strength of our balance sheet and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders following the results we announced a 9% increase in our quarterly common stock dividend and a $2.9 billion share repurchase program. Importantly, we're well positioned with substantial capital and liquidity to continue to support our customers and invest in our businesses.\nRob Reilly: Thank Bill good morning, everyone. As Bill just mentioned and notable during the second quarter, we successfully completed our acquisition of BBVA USA, significantly expanding our footprint which now includes growth market throughout the Sun Belt region. Our balance sheet is on Slide four and is presented on a spot basis while we typically cover our average balance sheet that will focus this quarter on spot balances due to the timing of the June 1 closing of the acquisition.\nOperator: Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseckwith Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nRob Reilly: Hey, good morning. Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: So it's great to see the loan growth start to pick up here. The first question I have is just on how we should think about the loan growth in your book. Now that BBVA USA has come in, is there going to be a churn period here where you've got some loans in that book that, you're likely to be exiting and then, growing through that churn or would you suggest that that's not really big enough to matter when we're thinking about the loan growth?\nRob Reilly: Well, it's the margin it's going to matter, but it's extended over a bunch of years. We're not -- we're not going to sell portfolios or -- or rapid exit. So, through time we will mature things and those balances will likely run off from certain industries, as we grow bounces from, from other target industries, but that stretches over, 2, 3, 4 years.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay, Great. All right and then separately, your house loans business obviously is already national, but does the BBVA footprint that you've added now do anything for them in their business with middle-market?\nRob Reilly: It's at the margin, right. It just adds a larger network of potential clients and conversations. So, yes, now they obviously are in all of these markets to some already, but now we have more clients and will therefore have more dialogue, so I would expect it well.\nBill Demchak: Yeah, for sure, so we'll be able to introduce our new commercial clients who BBVA USA to Harris-Williams if they haven't already been introduced.\nBetsy Graseck: Yeah, all right. That was a really strong result from them this quarter. And then just lastly, the dividend hike that you recently announced how you do -- how do you think about that from the perspective of payout ratio? And I'm just wondering, should we expect that your, full run rate of the BBVA USA expenses coming out is already in, how in, in your earnings outlook, when you were thinking about setting that dividend up?\nRob Reilly: I'm trying to think of the simple way to answer this. So long story short there's room on the dividend on our forward income. We were in a bit of a fire drill because, we, we managed to close the deal a month sooner than we thought, which meant that we kind of had CCAR results in the deal closed, which then threw us into the fire drill to figure out what we could do and I'm not going to say in a hurry, but on short notice which is what we did and coloration acceleration of kind of what we've thought. So, so there's room on that. certainly as we go forward and we just thought it was important to get something done and not miss this cycle which is, which is what we acted on.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay.\nRob Reilly: I'm sorry. We said for years that we expect, with this model and this business mix that a 40% to 50% payout ratio on the dividend is in our target range.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay, great all right. Yeah, no, that was my gut. Feel that there was room there. So appreciate the commentary. Thanks so much.\nOperator: And thank you for your question up next. We have a question from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nBill Carcache: You guys have made an impressive progress in your national expansion strategy. As you look ahead, how integral is the acquisition of additional branches to your furthering your national expansion on paper? It's easy to do a traditional analysis where you look at PNCs revenues per branch and BBVA rev -- BBVAs revenues per branch, to isolate the opportunity to improve productivity and what that would mean in terms of incremental revenues per branch? But when you try to sell the idea of acquiring additional branches to generalists, there's a natural pushback on why those branch acquisitions are necessary in the first place, given what we're seeing with the digitization of the business.RBC is a great example where we saw your branch count rise sharply in 2012 before falling significantly for the better part of the next decade. How important was it to acquire those branches to begin with, I know there's a lot there, but I was hoping you could speak to that point in general?\nRob Reilly: I wouldn't focus so much on branches as I would on clients. So in the future, could you see us do smaller deals in market to gain greater share? Possibly now the values today just seemed way too high to me, but possibly, but the purpose of that wouldn't be to get branches per se, instead it would be to get clients and then we would optimize the branch network and was we did with RBC after the fact.\nBill Demchak: And some natural conversion to solution centers, foundational branches which we, to your point Dell we've been doing.\nBill Carcache: Okay, all right. Understood with separately with the curve, having flattened a bit since your comments last quarter has there been any change to your thought process around deploying a larger percentage of your liquidity into securities and within that, how worried are you about giving up some of your future assets sensitivity in exchange for the near term? And I benefit we're hearing different philosophies from, from different banks, but would just love to get your thoughts?\nRob Reilly: Well, I guess first off as you saw we went at it pretty aggressively before we saw the, the, the, the big rally here. We still have a lot of liquidity. We barely put it down in our liquidity, even after writing the check for BBVA. So we're still very asset sensitive. Having said that the recent rally is going to cause us to slow down and be more tactical than we had, we had been during the last quarter and w we'll watch how this plays out. I personally believe that that, that the current rally is way overdone and I don't fully understand it. And we're likely to, or not likely we will slow down relative to what we saw in the last quarter.\nBill Demchak: And our expectations of that are built into our guidance.\nBill Carcache: Got it. And then if I could squeeze in one last one I wanted to ask, if you could look ahead a bit longer-term at the opportunity to drive efficiency improvements if the forward curve is right and we get one hike around the end of 2020 to one another in the middle of '23 and assume no further steepening there, there are a lot of moving parts there, but could you just speak to your competence level and being able to drive your efficiency ratio into that sort of know, high, 50% range?\nRob Reilly: The math takes you there. The question is simply a function of it, when we look out to '22 function that tailing integration costs as to whether you see it what period of time you'll actually see it, but the map takes you there. Once we get the costs out of the BBVA franchise and what we would expect that revenue environment to look like.\nOperator: Thank you. And up next, we have a question from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities, please go ahead, sir.\nMike Mayo: Hi .So, I guess I have a short-term question, a long-term question. The long-term question is what inning are you in, in your tech transformation? And you spent seven years getting your common infrastructure together, and that prepares you well for the BBVA integration. So that's kind of the, the good news and what inning are you in? But then I think the bad news is you're guiding this year for slightly negative operating leverage the last slide. And I know you don't like having that. And why is that worse than expected when you should be having some synergies from BBVA banks?\nRob Reilly: Well, I just, the short term one, they I'm glad you asked that question, Mike, cause at first raid, you might conclude that, but that's not what we're saying, what we're saying in the guidance for full year with revenues percentages going up less than expense percentages. That's simply the overlay of the BBVA USA acquisition six months into our results. They are, they have a higher efficiency ratio. So that's, if you think about it, that's that largely the opportunity there. And PNC standalone we said at the beginning of the year, it was going to be stable. We were going to fight for a positive operating leverage, halfway through revenues up low single digits expenses are up low single digits, so we're still fighting. And as I mentioned in my comments prior to the Q&A, we're going to keep fighting until, I don't know if you want to do that long-term.\nBill Demchak: Do you follow that my event, it's, it's simple. We layered on a less efficient organization on top of us and it's causing them out to be what it is. That's a legacy PNC business is kind of a target for what we said. And then the opportunity set is to drive, the new organization down to, to the level of efficiency. Yeah, we're better.\nMike Mayo: Okay.\nBill Demchak: Yeah. The issue on technology, I mean, think about look we're 80% of the way along where we would like to be in terms of what I would just call a modern platform across everything from data centers to the way we develop, to the way we do automated testing and deploy and so on and so forth. So we're pretty far along. I think what happens down the road with technology is much more about client facing technology and the ability to compete effectively in the new ecosystem of fintechs and where payments are going and all of that stuff. And we're prepared for that. We're going to invest hard into that. We have the core technology behind us to allow us to play in that space, but that's where the fight is going to be. And I think that game is just getting started.\nRob Reilly: And we'll start to extend the metaphor the games going into explaining technology is going to be around for a while.\nMike Mayo: And where do you think, I mean, you're, I appreciate a number like 80% and building a modern platform, but again, after seven or eight years of doing that, where do you think the, the average bank is in that transformation because you've been talking about this more than others?\nRob Reilly: Yeah. I look, I don't know. I don't have an informed view. It's, it's hard to figure out what other people are actually doing. If I just think about our ideal state compared to where we are. PNCs ideal state might be different than some plus somebody else's spires to, I still see us with certain applications that, that need to be re-engineered to, to kind of be plug and play through API. Other people may or may not care about that. So you we're, we're playing our own game. Our goal obviously is to, to be able to use technology as an advantage, not just in terms of cost, but also in terms of speed of market and creativity as to what we can offer to clients and we're well on our way right there.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. And now we have a question from the line of John Penn Carey with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, sir.\nJohn Penn Carey: Good Morning. Want see if you can give a little more color on loan demand particularly on the commercial side, or are you starting to see any signs of CapEx activity beginning to influence a line draw down? And if you are aware in what areas are you seeing some strength and what borrower segments? Thanks.\nRob Reilly: Yeah. Hey, John, it's Rob and I can give you a little bit of color there. The generally speaking utilization rates were up a little bit quarter over quarter, though, not much where we are seeing continued growth that we started to see as green shoots in the first quarter is in our business credit to asset base book. Real growth there that is encouraging because that tends to be a leading indicator of, of loan demand. So that's, that's largely where we've seen the growth. But on the margin, we would expect to see in terms of getting to where strong loan growth would be coming more utilization across the, the general middle market book which has yet to show up.\nBill Demchak: I mean, the good news inside all of that is we're actually winning a lot of clients and we're extending facilities at a pace beyond that. where we've been for a bunch of years. The problem is they're just not drawing under the credit facility. So we're, we're, we're in a good place for, for, when loan demand comes back and we continue to grow client share, and we see that by the way, on the fee growth that we're getting through TM and other activities picked up again. \nRob Reilly: So we definitely advanced in the first quarter.\nJohn Penn Carey: And then on the M&A front and they are still digesting the BBVA deal and everything, but as you look at other markets, are there any other markets geographically that you think a deal would make sense to give you a more critical mass just like you look at the southeast that way? I just wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about your footprint and how you think about that? And then separately Bill I am curious what your take is on Pres. Biden's Executive Order particularly implying more scrutiny around bank mergers. Does that change how you think about deals? Thanks.\nBill Demchak: You asked to the second -- on the first issue, you should just assume that we look at all the same stuff that you do. I am not going to give you area of the country when you look and you\u2019ve seen us through time make decisions based on value creation for shareholder so that may or may not mean additional geographies and may or may not mean filling in an existing geography. It will very likely mean we'll continue to do small add-on acquisitions that give us product capability of clients. The executive order looking at competition amongst banks, it's a practical matter that would actually have to change for the bank approval process to change would be more about the feds rules on approving mergers than I think it would be coming out of what President Biden's order. I'm not expert on it, but I think it is safe to say that a larger deal in today's environment would get much more political scrutiny and noise than we did with the BBVA deal that weighs on us.\nOperator: We now have a question from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead sir.\nScott Siefers: Rob I can back in the things based on the guidance but just would be curious to hear your thoughts on how the net interest margin rate moves from here? Just lots of moving parts between shifting some of the cash and the securities letting a full quarter BBVA and then you\u2019ve got the fair value premium amortization as well. So any thoughts there would be appreciated.\nRob Reilly: There a lot there Scott. We in fact in the first quarter, we had said we call the drop in NIM. We're still holding that and I do think NIM will drift higher not necessarily by a lot, but I think we've seen the bottom.\nScott Siefers: And then just on the reserves I think pre-adjustments that were made for COVID but CECL, I think you guys were around the 145-ish reserve. Is that a good number to assume you'll gear down toward even with BBVA now in the mix?\nRob Reilly: Well our day one was 154, not 145 and that was standalone and then if you do some of the math you'll find that BBVA day one we're going to be a little bit higher on average. So as we said and to clearly answer that question if you consider those times normal back to normal would be somewhere in that neighborhood.\nScott Siefers: Okay. Perfect. All I appreciate the thought.\nOperator: Thank you.  We now have a question from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead sir.\nGerard Cassidy: Bill, can you share with us when you think back to the National City deal and the RBC deals that you guys delivered 10 years ago and granted they're different than the BBVA deal, but obviously that experience has given you confidence on this deal. Can you share with us when you think the BBVA gets fully integrated based upon the experiences that you guys have with those prior two deals? Is it three years out, four years out? How long does it really become seamless where you can't tell everything is running very smoothly?\nRob Reilly: There's a lot embedded in that question. I mean that the basic service structure, so what happens in a branch, the applications the product delivery, all of that stuff, basically will be done by the end of this year. Right, so the real question then becomes, how do we get the client penetration and growth rates in the newer markets. the fee penetration to, to grow to legacy PNC markets. And what we found in RBC is in some of those newer markets that, that took are somewhere around three years, I guess, Rob, we expect it'll be faster. Today first, because BBVA actually had a reasonable book of business that we could cross sell into immediately. And secondly, we just kind of have a better playbook. We've been at it for a while. So we have the teams built today. They're calling today and I, I generally would expect we'd yeah, I think I'd be a little fast. And I think that the receptivity to the PNC brand is probably a little more than it was 30 years ago, so that, that helps too.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good and then I apologize if you addressed this or already in your comments, but Robert, do you guys have any timing on the share repurchase program? I think you said it's going to be over four quarters, but I know, there's no restriction now, like the old CCAR tests and you guys had limits on how many gigabytes, you given any thought on how you want to calibrate the repurchases?\nRob Reilly: Well, we're going to do it opportunistically chart, so we will do it ideally we'll, put together, like we always have some autopilot program. And then on top of that, some discretionary piece and the discretionary piece will be that the variable obviously. That's what we've done in the past. That's what we'll continue to do. So there's some more flexibility there obviously and we'll take advantage of that.\nOperator: Thank you. And next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy from Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question. Go ahead.\nTerry McEvoy: Thanks. Good morning. Just two questions here, I wonder if you could discuss the strength and consumer services fees. Last quarter was up what $442 million just on a standalone basis. And I know in the release, it said increased business activity, was wondering if you could provide any more color there?\nRob Reilly: Yeah. Hey Terry, this is Rob. Yeah, we did, we saw a lot of activity there. And most of that is just more consumer activity is that as you'd expect, as the economy comes back on track. Inside of that, where we saw particular strength was debit card spend. It is debit card spend is a big component of it. And the acceleration there was really strong. Maybe more color than you want, but what showed up this quarter or they set in debit card spends. What our team was telling us was a lot of micro purchases that had gone away. So cups of coffee and morning purchases on the, on the way to work are now part of the, part of the volume again.\nTerry McEvoy: Perfect and then there's a, follow-up just the corporate service fees. Maybe you could talk about the pipelines there and is the quarterly run rate now, is that a $600 plus million in revenue quarterly run rate today?\nRob Reilly: Well, I would say just in terms of the color, so you got to take a look at it now, obviously with him combined form and put in a full three months of BBVA, but corporate -- corporate fees. Also, as we said earlier, showing increased activity, we are a little elevated in the second quarter because of Harris Williams, which had twice the volume of the first quarter. So you got to take that into account, but you\u2019re mass in the right run rate place.\nOperator: Thank you. And we now have a follow-up question from the line of Bill Carcachewith Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\nBill Carcache: Thanks for the follow-up. I just had a quick, quick one on the money transfer business and the opportunity that you see there. Some investors that have expressed concerns over disintermediation risk in that business as the cost of transferring money continues to fall and competitors in the space, leverage technology to help consumers transfer money more cheaply. Is disintermediation risk and legacy BBVA's money transfer business, a concern for you guys? And if you could discuss how you're thinking about the growth outlook for that business and the opportunities that you guys may have to maybe leverage technology and just speak, speak to that opportunity in general, that'd be helpful.\nRob Reilly: I think the whole product; including the business transfer services is disintermediated product. It was what we have is the same thing that other people are building and frankly doing and more scale. The key to success on it is to make sure that you have distribution receiving networks, which we do have through Latin America and Europe and that you have compliance to be able to build it. So it's a competitive space. I'm glad we have the product. I think the actual product is going to be table stakes for banks. Our ability to grow it and scale it, we're going through different use cases that bring on potential corporate disbursements and other things that we hadn't thought of before. But I think it becomes a table stakes products that started through disintermediation kind of to your original question, right? This was built outside of the banking system. BBVA just happened to have built one, that we're now integrating into our core platform. So, so we're pretty excited by it. And I think time will tell how that product evolves and who uses it.\nBill Demchak: And the financial impact isn't large, it's more of the upside in anything under, so thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions.\nRob Reilly: All right. Well, very good. Thanks everybody. And we'll -- we'll see at the end of the third quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank Bill good morning, everyone. As Bill just mentioned and notable during the second quarter, we successfully completed our acquisition of BBVA USA, significantly expanding our footprint which now includes growth market throughout the Sun Belt region. Our balance sheet is on Slide four and is presented on a spot basis while we typically cover our average balance sheet that will focus this quarter on spot balances due to the timing of the June 1 closing of the acquisition. Hey, good morning. Betsy. Well, it's the margin it's going to matter, but it's extended over a bunch of years. We're not -- we're not going to sell portfolios or -- or rapid exit. So, through time we will mature things and those balances will likely run off from certain industries, as we grow bounces from, from other target industries, but that stretches over, 2, 3, 4 years. It's at the margin, right. It just adds a larger network of potential clients and conversations. So, yes, now they obviously are in all of these markets to some already, but now we have more clients and will therefore have more dialogue, so I would expect it well. I'm trying to think of the simple way to answer this. So long story short there's room on the dividend on our forward income. We were in a bit of a fire drill because, we, we managed to close the deal a month sooner than we thought, which meant that we kind of had CCAR results in the deal closed, which then threw us into the fire drill to figure out what we could do and I'm not going to say in a hurry, but on short notice which is what we did and coloration acceleration of kind of what we've thought. So, so there's room on that. certainly as we go forward and we just thought it was important to get something done and not miss this cycle which is, which is what we acted on. I'm sorry. We said for years that we expect, with this model and this business mix that a 40% to 50% payout ratio on the dividend is in our target range. I wouldn't focus so much on branches as I would on clients. So in the future, could you see us do smaller deals in market to gain greater share? Possibly now the values today just seemed way too high to me, but possibly, but the purpose of that wouldn't be to get branches per se, instead it would be to get clients and then we would optimize the branch network and was we did with RBC after the fact. Well, I guess first off as you saw we went at it pretty aggressively before we saw the, the, the, the big rally here. We still have a lot of liquidity. We barely put it down in our liquidity, even after writing the check for BBVA. So we're still very asset sensitive. Having said that the recent rally is going to cause us to slow down and be more tactical than we had, we had been during the last quarter and w we'll watch how this plays out. I personally believe that that, that the current rally is way overdone and I don't fully understand it. And we're likely to, or not likely we will slow down relative to what we saw in the last quarter. The math takes you there. The question is simply a function of it, when we look out to '22 function that tailing integration costs as to whether you see it what period of time you'll actually see it, but the map takes you there. Once we get the costs out of the BBVA franchise and what we would expect that revenue environment to look like. Well, I just, the short term one, they I'm glad you asked that question, Mike, cause at first raid, you might conclude that, but that's not what we're saying, what we're saying in the guidance for full year with revenues percentages going up less than expense percentages. That's simply the overlay of the BBVA USA acquisition six months into our results. They are, they have a higher efficiency ratio. So that's, if you think about it, that's that largely the opportunity there. And PNC standalone we said at the beginning of the year, it was going to be stable. We were going to fight for a positive operating leverage, halfway through revenues up low single digits expenses are up low single digits, so we're still fighting. And as I mentioned in my comments prior to the Q&A, we're going to keep fighting until, I don't know if you want to do that long-term. And we'll start to extend the metaphor the games going into explaining technology is going to be around for a while. Yeah. I look, I don't know. I don't have an informed view. It's, it's hard to figure out what other people are actually doing. If I just think about our ideal state compared to where we are. PNCs ideal state might be different than some plus somebody else's spires to, I still see us with certain applications that, that need to be re-engineered to, to kind of be plug and play through API. Other people may or may not care about that. So you we're, we're playing our own game. Our goal obviously is to, to be able to use technology as an advantage, not just in terms of cost, but also in terms of speed of market and creativity as to what we can offer to clients and we're well on our way right there. Yeah. Hey, John, it's Rob and I can give you a little bit of color there. The generally speaking utilization rates were up a little bit quarter over quarter, though, not much where we are seeing continued growth that we started to see as green shoots in the first quarter is in our business credit to asset base book. Real growth there that is encouraging because that tends to be a leading indicator of, of loan demand. So that's, that's largely where we've seen the growth. But on the margin, we would expect to see in terms of getting to where strong loan growth would be coming more utilization across the, the general middle market book which has yet to show up. So we definitely advanced in the first quarter. There a lot there Scott. We in fact in the first quarter, we had said we call the drop in NIM. We're still holding that and I do think NIM will drift higher not necessarily by a lot, but I think we've seen the bottom. Well our day one was 154, not 145 and that was standalone and then if you do some of the math you'll find that BBVA day one we're going to be a little bit higher on average. So as we said and to clearly answer that question if you consider those times normal back to normal would be somewhere in that neighborhood. There's a lot embedded in that question. I mean that the basic service structure, so what happens in a branch, the applications the product delivery, all of that stuff, basically will be done by the end of this year. Right, so the real question then becomes, how do we get the client penetration and growth rates in the newer markets. the fee penetration to, to grow to legacy PNC markets. And what we found in RBC is in some of those newer markets that, that took are somewhere around three years, I guess, Rob, we expect it'll be faster. Today first, because BBVA actually had a reasonable book of business that we could cross sell into immediately. And secondly, we just kind of have a better playbook. We've been at it for a while. So we have the teams built today. They're calling today and I, I generally would expect we'd yeah, I think I'd be a little fast. And I think that the receptivity to the PNC brand is probably a little more than it was 30 years ago, so that, that helps too. Well, we're going to do it opportunistically chart, so we will do it ideally we'll, put together, like we always have some autopilot program. And then on top of that, some discretionary piece and the discretionary piece will be that the variable obviously. That's what we've done in the past. That's what we'll continue to do. So there's some more flexibility there obviously and we'll take advantage of that. Yeah. Hey Terry, this is Rob. Yeah, we did, we saw a lot of activity there. And most of that is just more consumer activity is that as you'd expect, as the economy comes back on track. Inside of that, where we saw particular strength was debit card spend. It is debit card spend is a big component of it. And the acceleration there was really strong. Maybe more color than you want, but what showed up this quarter or they set in debit card spends. What our team was telling us was a lot of micro purchases that had gone away. So cups of coffee and morning purchases on the, on the way to work are now part of the, part of the volume again. Well, I would say just in terms of the color, so you got to take a look at it now, obviously with him combined form and put in a full three months of BBVA, but corporate -- corporate fees. Also, as we said earlier, showing increased activity, we are a little elevated in the second quarter because of Harris Williams, which had twice the volume of the first quarter. So you got to take that into account, but you're mass in the right run rate place. I think the whole product; including the business transfer services is disintermediated product. It was what we have is the same thing that other people are building and frankly doing and more scale. The key to success on it is to make sure that you have distribution receiving networks, which we do have through Latin America and Europe and that you have compliance to be able to build it. So it's a competitive space. I'm glad we have the product. I think the actual product is going to be table stakes for banks.

            "name": "Bill Demchak",
            "content": "Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you've seen, we accomplished a lot in the second quarter and most important was the closing of the acquisition of BBVA USA on June 1. Obviously this created a fair amount of noise in our reported results adding one month of BBVA USA operating results and the impact of purchase accounting adjustments as well as merger-related impacts. Rob's going to take you through all of that in a couple of minutes, but putting those things aside, we had a pretty good quarter driven by solid net interest income, strong fee growth,, continued improvements in credit quality and announcement of higher capital returns. While loans increased primarily due to the acquisition, we did have spot loan growth from both consumer and C&I in the legacy PNC balance sheet. We've seen loan utilization rate stabilized within our corporate institutional banking business. However, they remain near historic lows and while new loan approvals have rebounded actually to the highest level in a couple of years that's been offset by continued pay downs. Within the legacy -- within the PNC legacy consumer book, we saw loans grow in the quarter, which was encouraging and we're confident that strong economic growth is ultimately going to drive strong loan growth, but it remains an open debate as to the timing of that loan growth relative to the second half of '21 and into '22. During the quarter, we continued to deploy excess liquidity through $10 billion of net security purchases. Going forward and considering the significant recent rally in treasuries will be disciplined as we look to reduce our elevated cash position. You saw that our results underscore the strength of our balance sheet and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders following the results we announced a 9% increase in our quarterly common stock dividend and a $2.9 billion share repurchase program. Importantly, we're well positioned with substantial capital and liquidity to continue to support our customers and invest in our businesses. Yeah, for sure, so we'll be able to introduce our new commercial clients who BBVA USA to Harris-Williams if they haven't already been introduced. And some natural conversion to solution centers, foundational branches which we, to your point Dell we've been doing. And our expectations of that are built into our guidance. Do you follow that my event, it's, it's simple. We layered on a less efficient organization on top of us and it's causing them out to be what it is. That's a legacy PNC business is kind of a target for what we said. And then the opportunity set is to drive, the new organization down to, to the level of efficiency. Yeah, we're better. Yeah. The issue on technology, I mean, think about look we're 80% of the way along where we would like to be in terms of what I would just call a modern platform across everything from data centers to the way we develop, to the way we do automated testing and deploy and so on and so forth. So we're pretty far along. I think what happens down the road with technology is much more about client facing technology and the ability to compete effectively in the new ecosystem of fintechs and where payments are going and all of that stuff. And we're prepared for that. We're going to invest hard into that. We have the core technology behind us to allow us to play in that space, but that's where the fight is going to be. And I think that game is just getting started. I mean, the good news inside all of that is we're actually winning a lot of clients and we're extending facilities at a pace beyond that. where we've been for a bunch of years. The problem is they're just not drawing under the credit facility. So we're, we're, we're in a good place for, for, when loan demand comes back and we continue to grow client share, and we see that by the way, on the fee growth that we're getting through TM and other activities picked up again. You asked to the second -- on the first issue, you should just assume that we look at all the same stuff that you do. I am not going to give you area of the country when you look and you've seen us through time make decisions based on value creation for shareholder so that may or may not mean additional geographies and may or may not mean filling in an existing geography. It will very likely mean we'll continue to do small add-on acquisitions that give us product capability of clients. The executive order looking at competition amongst banks, it's a practical matter that would actually have to change for the bank approval process to change would be more about the feds rules on approving mergers than I think it would be coming out of what President Biden's order. I'm not expert on it, but I think it is safe to say that a larger deal in today's environment would get much more political scrutiny and noise than we did with the BBVA deal that weighs on us. And the financial impact isn't large, it's more of the upside in anything under, so thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PNC Financial Services Group Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. . As a reminder, this call is being recorded.  I will now turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bryan Gill. Please go ahead, sir.\nBryan Gill: Well, thank you, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These materials are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of April 16, 2021, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Demchak: Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you saw, we had a solid start to the year as we grew revenue and controlled our expenses to generate positive operating leverage in the linked quarter comparison. Our first quarter results also benefited from our provision recapture, driven largely by an improving economic outlook. Despite this recapture, our reserves remain at over 2% of loans as we continue to work through the COVID fallout and work to understand potential secular changes on certain asset classes. Our capital and liquidity levels also remain at record highs. With a rise in term yields, we've been deploying some of this excess liquidity and increased our investment securities by $9 billion at period end. You'll notice they didn't change much on an average basis as we bought later in the quarter. We also actually added another $9 billion in  that are going to settle early in the second quarter here. And finally, we've continued our purchase activity into the second quarter, and we continue to operate, notwithstanding this at very high levels of cash at the Fed that can be deployed over time in loans or securities based on market opportunities. While not a surprise, the quarter was impacted by continued weak loan demand in the face of strong bond market issuance levels, pay downs and competition resulting in historically low utilization levels. Based on the strength of the U.S. economy, we would expect to see loan demand improve and ultimately drive utilization rates higher over time. We continue to execute well against our strategic priorities, including our national expansion, which will significantly accelerate through our pending acquisition of BBVA USA. We're making good progress on BBVA integration planning and are on track for a midyear close, pending regulatory approval. We haven't found any significant surprises regarding the quality or nature of BBVA's business, and our employees are working effectively with their BBVA counterparts on everything, including the technology conversion. With the quality of BBVA markets, especially in their largest market, in Texas -- and the quality of their largest markets, especially in Texas, and is proving to be everything we hoped it would. As we planned for the integration of BBVA USA, we continue to invest in and leverage our own technology so that we can better serve our customers.\nRob Reilly: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we reported first quarter net income of $1.8 billion or $4.10 per diluted common share. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis. During the quarter, loans declined by $8 billion or 3% due to lower utilization and continued soft loan demand. Investment securities grew approximately $700 million or 1% linked quarter. However, on a spot basis, balances increased $9 billion or 11% as we accelerated our purchase activity near the end of the quarter due to the steepening yield curve. Our average cash balances at the Federal Reserve grew to $85 billion in the first quarter, driven by continued deposit growth and lower loan balance.  On the liability side, deposit balances averaged $365 billion and were up $6 billion or 2% linked quarter. Borrowed funds decreased $3 billion compared to the fourth quarter due to the runoff and redemption of debt obligations. Our tangible book value was $96.57 per common share as of March 31, a decrease on a linked-quarter basis primarily due to a decline in AOCI. Year-over-year, tangible book value increased 14%. And as March -- as of March 31, 2021, our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 12.6%.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. \nBetsy Graseck: So 2 questions. One, on your NII guide. You mentioned up approximately 2%, that's for the first quarter. But then in the commentary around\u2026\nRob Reilly: Second quarter.\nBetsy Graseck: Second quarter, sorry.\nRob Reilly: Yes. That's right.\nBetsy Graseck: Right. And then in the commentary around your securities book, you were highlighting that you're planning to raise securities book to what, 20% to 25% -- 25% to 30% by year-end. So I just wanted to kind of get your sense as you're building towards your goal by year-end, should we be anticipating that this rate of change of improvement in second quarter NII is something that we should be expecting could persist if the forward curve sticks around where it is in 3Q and 4Q as well?\nRob Reilly: Sure. So yes, again, that was for the second quarter on the NII guide. When we take a look at the full year -- and this is part of our guidance in terms of revenue being stable for the full year, we do expect some more NII from our securities book as we increase the balances, and that's going to be offset by a little bit less loan growth than what we were expecting at the beginning of the year. So that's where we come out in terms of stable.  In regard to the building up of the securities book, I mean, it's 3 things, really. One, we have put more money to work because the curve has steepened. Second, we're going to continue to do that in a measured way. And then third, for the foreseeable future, we'll be running as a percentage of our interest-earning assets securities balances at a higher level. So historically, we've been approximately in the 20% range. We're guiding toward more of the 25% to 30% range.\nBill Demchak: Yes. And Betsy, the only thing I would add is, you said it's kind of a goal. It's not really a goal. It's just our expectation, given the carry right now and how much cash we're sitting on that -- the reason we put that in there is that our security balances, and frankly, for the whole industry are likely to run higher as a percentage of our total assets than they have historically. And we'll keep adding to them throughout the year opportunistically as we've done. But you see that in the actions late in the fourth quarter -- sorry, late in the first quarter. If we were simply trying to drive NII, we could have front-loaded those purchases at lower yields and had NII flat. We didn't do that. We waited. Waiting turns out to have been the right thing. And you'll see us do that. You've seen us do that, but you'll see us continue to do that through the course of the year.\nBetsy Graseck: I totally get it. It's such an unusual environment here with the loan-to-deposit ratio is so low and what's going on with the liquidity in your books, so that makes a lot of sense. And the revenue being stable for the full year with the loan commentary you just made, I mean part of that is a function of the PPP roll-off that's expected. Is that fair?\nRob Reilly: Yes, in part. Yes, that's all part. That's all built in.\nBetsy Graseck: And then on your -- yes, go ahead.\nBill Demchak: I\u2019d just say, look, the biggest unknown on loan growth specifically is when the inventory start -- the inventory build starts for our corporate customers. Utilization is running as much as 11 points below the peak, maybe 5 points below sort of historic averages. And even though the economy is really kind of taken off here, for whatever reason, we haven't seen the typical inventory build and CapEx that you would see in this economy, I guess just hesitancy waiting for more certainty on the pandemic. But when that happens, and it will happen, it almost mechanically has to happen, you're going to see pretty appreciable loan growth. We just don't know when that's going to be.\nRob Reilly: Particularly as it relates to 2021.\nBill Demchak: Yes.\nBetsy Graseck: Got it. All right. And then just separately on the BBVA USA projected PPNR, that $700 million, up $100 million from your prior guide. What's driving that delta?\nRob Reilly: Yes. As I said in my comments -- Betsy, this is Rob. It's largely refinements in our assumptions around interest rates and some general true-ups relative to the assumptions that we had at the time that we announced the deal.\nBetsy Graseck: But just based on our prior conversation, is it more that you're expecting they have more asset sensitivity in their book than you thought before?\nRob Reilly: Not necessarily. No.\nBill Demchak: There's so many little things. Rates moved in our favor. We're doing really well on expense opportunities, a whole variety of things, and they ended up\u2026\nRob Reilly: Yes, that's right, true-ups from assumptions that we made last November, and the environment has changed a lot.\nBill Demchak: And our knowledge.\nRob Reilly: And our knowledge, that's right. That's right.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research.\nJohn McDonald: Bill, I wanted to follow-up on the loan growth thoughts. We're all just kind of thinking out loud here. But could we see the inventory and the CapEx pickup, but still not kind of see loan demand because corporates have a lot of cash and other alternatives in supply? How much is that a factor too do you think going on right now?\nBill Demchak: That will obviously impact our large corporate book, which I think at the moment, has its lowest utilization rate ever. But the bulk of our book, remember, some 90-plus-percent of our clients are private companies. And so our middle market and commercial book really doesn't have access to the public markets and that cash build that you're seeing in large corporate. So I do think you'll see utilization there increase. By the way, we've seen utilization increases in our asset-based lending book but they're small. That's kind of the first place you would expect to see it. So that's encouraging.\nJohn McDonald: Got it. And Rob, did you say that you're not building in a second half pickup too much in your expectation?\nRob Reilly: Yes. That is what I said, John, yes. Because at this point, it\u2019s conjecture.\nJohn McDonald: Yes. And Rob, a follow-up for you. Obviously, your capital ratios have gone quite high. Is it fair -- and I know you don't want to get into deal assumptions and all that. But is it fair to us -- for us to think that you'll end -- close the deal with higher capital than the 9.3% pro forma just given where you're starting from now. And could you remind us to just what CET1 ratio feels appropriate as a target for you guys longer term?\nRob Reilly: Yes. Sure. Sure. On the BBVA, I would say, on everything, we'll have a whole bunch of numbers for you once we close the deal. But for today's purposes, we're tracking at or above all of our assumptions including the CET1 ratio. So yes, my estimations are that it will be higher than that 9.3%, but we'll get into that detail once we own the bank.  In regard to our targets, we've always set around 8.5%. That's been sort of the level that we felt comfortable with. Obviously, we've been a lot higher than that. So the relevance of that number isn't as strong as it was a few years ago.\nBill Demchak: John, you're asking the question, are we going to have excess capital that can be deployed in share buybacks and other things. And the answer is, yes.\nRob Reilly: Yes. That's right.\nJohn McDonald: Yes. And the deal doesn't change or how you think about the right capital level for the company?\nRob Reilly: No. No.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.\nScott Siefers : And maybe to revisit the loan growth thing. So I mean, you guys are seeing same trends as everybody else, but you guys are a bit unique in terms of how much of the country you see. Are there any geographic differences on utilization or sort of hesitancy on inventory? I mean, certain parts of the country just didn't necessarily shut down. They reopened earlier, more quickly, et cetera. I guess, I'm just curious if there's any differences either geographically or anywhere?\nRob Reilly: Not particularly, no. We haven't seen geographic differences. Utilization is low across the board.\nBill Demchak: I think one of the issues is supply chains have been so disrupted that people actually can't build inventory. And we're strangely being held back by demand and production capacity.\nScott Siefers : Yes. Yes, that definitely makes sense. It's just such an unusual phenomenon, but I appreciate the thoughts there. And then maybe just more of  one. The other fee expectation, so it was a very, very strong quarter this quarter. I think the guide is a bit higher than is typical in the second quarter. Just maybe sort of the nuance, Rob, just sort of how you're thinking about that line going forward?\nRob Reilly: Yes. That's -- we get some volatility on that quarter-to-quarter because there's a lot of elements there. But the guide is $300 million to $350 million is what we expect to occur in the second quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.\nErika Najarian: During this earnings season, we've asked a lot of questions as analysts of when loan growth is going to recover from a cyclical standpoint. But I'm wondering, given the deal expected to close in midyear and as we think about how this could potentially help. Maybe, Bill, talk through how these newer markets could potentially give you an even better opportunity to capture loan growth recovery once that come?\nBill Demchak: I think that's going to be the case. But I think one of the things we've been careful to do and sort of framing our expectations for you guys around BBVA we recognize that there are parts of their balance sheet that we would likely shrink, both because of concentrations across the combined firm but also because there are some sectors they don't want to be in, offset by our growth in these new markets. So in the out years, I get really bullish about our growth potential. But for the first year or so, we're going to -- and we've -- this is all in sort of the numbers we gave you, there's going to be a little trade-off of we'll be growing the business we want as we shrink some of the business we won't. So the real acceleration is probably a couple of years down the road.\nErika Najarian: Got it. And as you have made more progress on -- towards closing the deal, can you give us a sense of, you still feel like there's not going to be a significant amount of investment that you have to put into the combined franchise in terms of technology and other things. So obviously, some investors are thinking about another deal that had closed prior, where there was a lot of investment spend that was a little bit of a surprise. That's the question.\nBill Demchak: I won't talk about what other people are doing, but we pretty much have this nailed down. We know -- and it's all in the numbers we've given you. We are going to invest in certain capacity for their branches, for example, on connectivity, faster routers, we're going to expand some of the compute capacity we have in our cloud. But all of that we've given you -- and it's not a big deal, it was all on the deal assumptions and all those thing are proving to be correct.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: I just wanted to follow-up on the fee side, 3 to 5 growth in the second. It was pretty good numbers to begin in the first. Just wondering if you could help us understand just where you expect growth is coming from and what do you think is going to lead that forward?\nRob Reilly: Sure, Ken. Yes, I would say on the fees, as we look forward to the second quarter relative to the guide, corporate services and consumer services will be up, we'd expect in sort of that mid-single-digit range and then the other fee categories, asset management, mortgage and service charges on deposits, probably low single-digits. So that's sort of how we get to that range.\nKen Usdin: Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up on mortgage, obviously, not a bigger line for you guys. But just given some changes in the business you guys have been making and the relatively new platform. Just do you see share gain opportunities? And is the fight just against gain-on-sale margins in terms of just how resi can continue to build over time?\nRob Reilly: Yes. I mean, hey, mortgage isn't as big as a percentage of our business as others, but we're very excited about what we've built and the opportunities that we have. Particularly, the market will do -- what the market will do is particularly around building out the purchase side in terms of our consumer customers, which will be expanded with the BBVA acquisition.\nKen Usdin: Okay. Last little follow up. Just, Rob, I know you guys don't really give us a number on just premium inside the bond book. But can you just help us understand, has it been a drag? Is it -- you're buying a lot of bonds, you're probably still buying some premium bonds, too. Just how should we just think about that big picture?\nRob Reilly: Yes. It's come down a little bit, and we'd expect it to continue to come down a bit.\nKen Usdin: Even with purchases?\nRob Reilly: And it is in the numbers. Yes, even with the purchases.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: In terms of the guidance for the acquisition, so from $600 million to $700 million. Look, the bank index is up 40% since November 15 when you announced the deal. So I guess, it seems logical that your benefits are going to be greater, especially with a fixed price. So what does that mean for 2022 and the ultimate savings? I mean, mathematically, it's -- if you look at the industry and you look at BBVA, of course it should be higher at this point. It is good timing. Can you say what it means for the next kind of couple of years?\nBill Demchak: I'm trying to figure out where you're going with that, Mike. I mean, we're going to -- once we close the deal, we'll give you some updates on numbers and so forth. I guess what I would say to you is, we remain -- I remain, and also even to a greater extent, really excited by the growth potential of this deal. We tend -- when you do a deal, you give kind of a year and a half worth of guidance when all the marvels are thrown up in the air and you're working on cost saves and integration. The potential of the franchise in these markets is phenomenal. The potential for cross-sell and for growth of new clients is phenomenal. And we're really excited by that.\nMike Mayo: I guess I'll just wait until you close it and get more information for 2022 guidance.\nRob Reilly: And we'll have it.\nBill Demchak: Yes. \nMike Mayo: Okay. Well, let me get some concrete numbers from you. I love what you're saying about the loan data. I just -- I love data. So when you say you're 11 points below peak utilization and 5 points below average, what are those numbers? And you also say corporate lending utilization is the lowest ever. What's that percentage? If I could have those, that would be great.\nBill Demchak: So the only one I can think of right off the top of my head is, our corporate finance utilization is 57% of the peak number. And I think -- I saw some....\nRob Reilly: That was lower there. Yes.\nBill Demchak: And that's a function of all the corporate cash. That the 11-point drop was off of the high utilization we saw, Mike, with all the draws during the first quarter of last year, which is why the average maybe 5%. And it's hit -- certain areas have been impacted more than others. municipal utilization is way, way down. As I said, corporate finance is way, way down. Even our asset-based business, which typically runs fairly high utilization has really struggled just given the lack of ability to build inventory. So I don't know if you remember the number, Rob, but we've messed around with -- if you kind of regress economic growth, retail sales, a whole bunch of other different things against -- and inventory levels against loan utilization, it's in squared up over 80. And it should be growing today. We just haven't seen it. I can't give an answer as to why.\nMike Mayo: And then last one. You said private companies are over 90% of your customers as a percentage of loan balances, how much of that be could you say?\nBill Demchak: That's by number. So by loan balances, it's -- I'm going to say it's half.\nRob Reilly: Yes, that's right. That's a better number. And that's obviously on the institutional corporate side. Yes.\nMike Mayo: And just -- I mean, I guess you're just being conservative or what? Because you're saying it has to \u201cMechanically has to happen. It's in the process.\u201d You're starting to see an asset-based lending, but you're not building it in your expectations even for the fourth quarter of this year. So is that just you being conservative or\u2026?\nBill Demchak: Yes. No, it's us saying -- look, Mike, we could sit here and tell you all of them, and I\u2019ve latched some of these calls. So the back half of the year is going to be great. Everything will be wonderful. I hope they're right. And if they're right, we'll do really well. But I can't promise you that\u2026.\nRob Reilly : Or specific timing. \nBill Demchak: Yes. What we show you is the stuff we know. I know that mechanically our loan balances are going to grow as the economy improves and they build inventories. I can't tell you the timing of that. By the way, nobody else can either.\nOperator: . Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Can you guys talk about -- your deposit balances, of course, are up dramatically. You've given that to us. And Bill, you've talked about the utilization of your customers with the liquidity. Is that the #1 driver of possibly taking deposits down? Or some of your custody bank is not necessarily your peer, but the custody banks are hoping for higher rates to bring their balances down. How much would rising short-term interest rates help you guys bring down your deposit balances to get the loan-to-deposit ratio in more of a historical relationship without having the loans having to grow dramatically?\nBill Demchak: I don't think rising short-term rates has any impact at all. I think as a practical matter, deposit balances in the industry are driven by the size of the Fed's balance sheet and fiscal transfers, coupled with loan growth. Loan growth will actually drive more deposit balances once we see a pickup in that. And I think excess liquidity in the system is here to stay for a long period of time. Because I don't think the Fed is going to shrink their balance sheet anytime soon. So I think we're going to be in a -- there's a structural change in banking, which is going to have more liquidity, higher security balances for an extended period of time.\nRob Reilly: For the foreseeable future for sure.\nBill Demchak: Yes. \nGerard Cassidy: Very good, which obviously, I agree with you guys on that as well. Shifting over to the allowance for credit losses in your slide, I think it was Slide 10, you gave us good color on the levels and what drives those with the portfolio changes and the economic qualitative factors, recognizing BBVA is going to influence this number on the out years. But when you look at the reserves and you compare them to the day 1 reserves back in January 1, 2020, which you guys show here, you're still well above them. And if the economy over the next 12 to 18 months is even going to be better than what we all thought on January 1, 2020, pre-pandemic, that would suggest reserves should come down. Do you think you'd get close to that day 1 level? Or is that just too low?\nRob Reilly: No. I think you can get there to that level. It's just a question like as you pointed out in terms of timing. So our reserves right now reflect our current forecast. If subsequent forecasts are more bullish or more optimistic, we'll continue on that trend. But the timing of how fast we would get there, Gerard, it\u2019s per earlier comments, difficult to be precise about.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor: Can you talk about your interest rate positioning post the actions you plan to take in the securities portfolio and then also after you fold in BBVA USA? I realize there are some moving pieces, but what would your expectations be in terms of how asset sensitive you are in factoring those 2 things in?\nRob Reilly: We're going to still end up being asset sensitive. I mean, largely because even with our suggested build, the deposits we're going to have with the Fed are going to be quite large. I would tell you that our duration of equity and measured asset sensitivity has decreased as a function of the rise in rates, but that's less about what we're doing and more about the negative convexity in the bank's balance sheet.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. Any way to kind of just frame how meaningfully levered you will be to rates, I guess, both the short and long end?\nBill Demchak: No. I mean\u2026.\nMatt O'Connor: I guess, put another way, like you have a lot of leverage to rising rates now, but as you grow the securities book\u2026\nBill Demchak: We're hardly going to dent it. I mean the chart -- you see the chart we have in there, where you see our cash balances versus security balances. But any loan growth you want in there, we're not buying the long end of the curve and we have a massive opportunity to deploy that. But as we always do, we're going to increment our way in. By the way, incrementing our way in is what gets us to that 25%.\nMatt O'Connor: And then separately, I'm probably getting a little ahead of myself here. But as we think after the BBVA deal closes, you've clearly shifted your view to wanting branches nationally. And would the thought be to lead with organic growth? Or because you're basically folding them into your platform, would you be ready to do another deal, maybe quicker than normally? We certainly mechanically would be ready to do another deal. I think like all things, it's a function of where you created value. It's cheaper to go organically, which it was for a bunch of years, then we would choose that route. I personally believe that we will see opportunities in smaller institutions simply because of the massive shift in technology and the cost of technology that we've seen to serve customers. So, I think low rates, not a lot of loan growth, big technology costs are going to give us opportunities to continue to create scale.\nRob Reilly: And we'll have those capabilities.\nBill Demchak: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.\nBill Carcache: So Bill and Rob, can you discuss how you guys are thinking about pent-up demand dynamics for your consumer versus commercial customers? Where is there greater gearing to the reopening and how to access savings and excess liquidity on both sides, shape review?\nRob Reilly: Well, sort of our outlook for consumer lending, is that sort of what you're getting at?\nBill Demchak: Trying to find your question.\nBill Carcache: Yes. I guess, just thinking about, as we look to like sort of these pent-up demand dynamics and sort of like the reopening and like kind of animal spirits being unleashed as you look to the second half of the year and all of that being a positive for loan growth. Like how does that differ between the consumer and the commercial side? Like there's a lot of liquidity sitting around on commercial balance sheets. There's -- consumer has a lot of savings. But does that sort of delay like the rebound in balance growth on each side? Or are both sides going to be affected similarly or differently? Maybe some sort of perspective.\nBill Demchak: I see where you're going. I think consumer lending is going to drag C&I increase. I think consumers are really flushed with cash. You've seen retail sales. I think they continue to accelerate, by the way. But what's happening is that people who don't are buying and the people who would normally borrow are sitting on fiscal payments that they're going to have to burn through over time before you see balance growth. We're seeing massive transaction volumes. So we see it in our swipe fees in effect. But I don't know that you're going to see balanced growth. I think consumer will lag commercial. And I get back this place where inside of commercial, the smaller non-public companies and even some of the smaller public companies will continue to rely on bank balance sheets to fuel their growth.\nBill Carcache: Got it. That's very helpful. And Bill, maybe I could circle back on a question there, I'd asked you a while ago about sort of the financial technology players like the times of the world, and maybe just specifically on -- any color that you can give on perhaps how active you are in discussions with regulators regarding sort of the uneven playing field with many of these players, particularly some of these players are benefiting from things like unregulated debit interchange, which was never intended for them. It was more for like the small cap -- smaller bank exemption that was intended for post Durbin. And so I guess, is there any expectation of a leveling of the playing field, do you see in the future? Or is this sort of the competitive landscape that is sort of the new reality?\nBill Demchak: So it is a topic of interest, both on the political and regulatory side, less about competition and more about safety and soundness and data protection and fraud. And not -- I'm not referring to Chime specifically, but rather new entrants into the payment space, the exponential increase in fraud we've seen because of less robust know-your-customer rules and frankly, probably just because of the COVID environment. All of that has gathered attention of politicians and regulators. The competition side, we're happy to compete. I'm somewhat shocked actually, nobody's asked me a question about Low Cash Mode that we rolled out this -- yesterday, day before. That product is a result of years of technology investment that allows us, I think, is the only institution in the world to have effectively real-time capability of what's going on in our customers' accounts. And therefore, showing them what's going on in their accounts, and therefore, empowering them to choose what's going on in their accounts. No, fintech has that. Go back to -- because they rely on these small banks as their back office, which, in turn, are relying on 30-year-old cobalt-based mainframe-based batch process, not very exciting core processors. Get on, bring on the competition. At some point, they need to make money and to justify their existence.  Our challenge is presenting -- and we think we do this, a great proposition to our customers with ease of use and the very best products. And I think we have the technology backbone to do that. So I'm less worried about competing with somebody. I'm more worried about safety and soundness to the system and data and disruption to our customers who don't understand where data is being shared and who has access to it.\nBill Carcache: That's very helpful. I was going to ask about the new service, which I saw you talk about it on CNBC, I figured I\u2019d save my question. If I could squeeze in maybe one last one. Are treasury departments of any of your clients even remotely considering the idea of having some allocation to Bitcoin? We've seen some businesses move in that direction. And with the coin-based IPO, I guess, it sort of seems like it's a bit out of left field, but perhaps you can argue becoming more mainstream. And so just wondering, is that something that your treasury function is preparing for? And then maybe on the wealth side, are any wealth clients expressing interest in gaining exposure to crypto assets? Any thoughts on how you guys are sort of positioned for any potential emergence of crypto as a potential asset class, especially in the aftermath of that Coinbase?\nBill Demchak: Well, we've been working on this long before Coinbase went public back, we've talked to Coinbase about partnership and custody for our wealth clients. Practically, we've had a work stream around this, both for our corporate clients and treasury, but also for our wealth clients. The technology stretch isn't a big deal for us. It's more of a compliance-based issues that you would expect; and then importantly, choosing the right partners that you would choose as a trading transfer platform, and importantly, the custody platform. So that's an open and continuing dialogue here.\nRob Reilly: And suitability in fiduciary.\nBill Demchak: Yes. You can imagine that for wealth clients, there'd be a lot of disclosure around. It's your own risk.\nRob Reilly: Right. Right.\nOperator: We have a follow-up from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: The fintech comment, not me to ask another question. If you think about some of the players in the bank, in the industry, they're starting to set up bilateral relationships, even multilateral relationships with some big tech. And that's an option versus going directly for the consumer, especially with you going national now. Are you looking to continue permanently with getting customers directly? Or are you looking to partner more to lower your customer acquisition cost and go more broadly, kind of like banking-as-a-service as a plan B?\nBill Demchak: We're going to get them directly. Look Mike, I think when you effectively offer your products as the low-cost provider to somebody else who owns the relationship, you've just -- you sold your soul to the devil. It's the beginning of the end of your franchise in whatever space you're playing. We need to own the customer relationship, and we need to deserve to own the customer relationship through an offering that doesn't need to have fintech platform on the front end. It's the alternative to that, right? And this is -- you heard Jamie talk about this as well. If tech gets into the space and owns client relationships, then we become a commodity provider industry with 5,000 participants, it\u2019s a disaster. You can't default to that end game. You have to own the customer.\nMike Mayo: And when you think about the risk with data, to the extent customers open banking and if customers opt-in to share their data with other providers, does that force your hand more? Or how do you defend against that?\nBill Demchak: I think there's a lot of appropriate focus on data. The CFPB, I know, is working on this as our various politicians and other regulators. We need safety and soundness around data. That is the biggest systemic risk at the moment in my view. People talk about cyber, but what they're really talking about is data. And disruption of account flows, payment flows because data is corrupted. The consumer -- that, by the way, is solved, ultimately through tokenized API-based authorization at the bank for what the consumer wants to share, not through screen scraping. And we're working our way towards that. I think that's the ultimate end game. But the consumer has to be empowered to share data, but the data they want and to share it when they want. Not all the time and not everything and not to places that are otherwise, in my view, not regulated in terms of their controls around data.\nRob Reilly: And looking to monetize that data in some way.\nBill Demchak: Yes.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time.\nBryan Gill: Okay. Well, thanks, Frank. Bill, would you like to make any closing time.\nBill Demchak: Thank you, everybody. Look forward to talking at the end of the second quarter. Stay safe. Looking forward to summer here, I hope you're doing the same.\nRob Reilly: Take care.\nBryan Gill: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

            "name": "Rob Reilly",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we reported first quarter net income of $1.8 billion or $4.10 per diluted common share. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis. During the quarter, loans declined by $8 billion or 3% due to lower utilization and continued soft loan demand. Investment securities grew approximately $700 million or 1% linked quarter. However, on a spot basis, balances increased $9 billion or 11% as we accelerated our purchase activity near the end of the quarter due to the steepening yield curve. Our average cash balances at the Federal Reserve grew to $85 billion in the first quarter, driven by continued deposit growth and lower loan balance.  On the liability side, deposit balances averaged $365 billion and were up $6 billion or 2% linked quarter. Borrowed funds decreased $3 billion compared to the fourth quarter due to the runoff and redemption of debt obligations. Our tangible book value was $96.57 per common share as of March 31, a decrease on a linked-quarter basis primarily due to a decline in AOCI. Year-over-year, tangible book value increased 14%. And as March -- as of March 31, 2021, our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 12.6%. Second quarter. Yes. That's right. Sure. So yes, again, that was for the second quarter on the NII guide. When we take a look at the full year -- and this is part of our guidance in terms of revenue being stable for the full year, we do expect some more NII from our securities book as we increase the balances, and that's going to be offset by a little bit less loan growth than what we were expecting at the beginning of the year. So that's where we come out in terms of stable.  In regard to the building up of the securities book, I mean, it's 3 things, really. One, we have put more money to work because the curve has steepened. Second, we're going to continue to do that in a measured way. And then third, for the foreseeable future, we'll be running as a percentage of our interest-earning assets securities balances at a higher level. So historically, we've been approximately in the 20% range. We're guiding toward more of the 25% to 30% range. Yes, in part. Yes, that's all part. That's all built in. Particularly as it relates to 2021. Yes. As I said in my comments -- Betsy, this is Rob. It's largely refinements in our assumptions around interest rates and some general true-ups relative to the assumptions that we had at the time that we announced the deal. Not necessarily. No. Yes, that's right, true-ups from assumptions that we made last November, and the environment has changed a lot. And our knowledge, that's right. That's right. Yes. That is what I said, John, yes. Because at this point, it's conjecture. Yes. Sure. Sure. On the BBVA, I would say, on everything, we'll have a whole bunch of numbers for you once we close the deal. But for today's purposes, we're tracking at or above all of our assumptions including the CET1 ratio. So yes, my estimations are that it will be higher than that 9.3%, but we'll get into that detail once we own the bank.  In regard to our targets, we've always set around 8.5%. That's been sort of the level that we felt comfortable with. Obviously, we've been a lot higher than that. So the relevance of that number isn't as strong as it was a few years ago. Yes. That's right. No. No. Not particularly, no. We haven't seen geographic differences. Utilization is low across the board. Yes. That's -- we get some volatility on that quarter-to-quarter because there's a lot of elements there. But the guide is $300 million to $350 million is what we expect to occur in the second quarter. Sure, Ken. Yes, I would say on the fees, as we look forward to the second quarter relative to the guide, corporate services and consumer services will be up, we'd expect in sort of that mid-single-digit range and then the other fee categories, asset management, mortgage and service charges on deposits, probably low single-digits. So that's sort of how we get to that range. Yes. I mean, hey, mortgage isn't as big as a percentage of our business as others, but we're very excited about what we've built and the opportunities that we have. Particularly, the market will do -- what the market will do is particularly around building out the purchase side in terms of our consumer customers, which will be expanded with the BBVA acquisition. Yes. It's come down a little bit, and we'd expect it to continue to come down a bit. And it is in the numbers. Yes, even with the purchases. And we'll have it. That was lower there. Yes. Yes, that's right. That's a better number. And that's obviously on the institutional corporate side. Yes. Or specific timing. For the foreseeable future for sure. No. I think you can get there to that level. It's just a question like as you pointed out in terms of timing. So our reserves right now reflect our current forecast. If subsequent forecasts are more bullish or more optimistic, we'll continue on that trend. But the timing of how fast we would get there, Gerard, it's per earlier comments, difficult to be precise about. We're going to still end up being asset sensitive.

And we'll have those capabilities. Well, sort of our outlook for consumer lending, is that sort of what you're getting at? And suitability in fiduciary. Right. Right. And looking to monetize that data in some way. Take care."

            "name": "Bill Demchak",
            "content": "Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you saw, we had a solid start to the year as we grew revenue and controlled our expenses to generate positive operating leverage in the linked quarter comparison. Our first quarter results also benefited from our provision recapture, driven largely by an improving economic outlook. Despite this recapture, our reserves remain at over 2% of loans as we continue to work through the COVID fallout and work to understand potential secular changes on certain asset classes. Our capital and liquidity levels also remain at record highs. With a rise in term yields, we've been deploying some of this excess liquidity and increased our investment securities by $9 billion at period end. You'll notice they didn't change much on an average basis as we bought later in the quarter. We also actually added another $9 billion in  that are going to settle early in the second quarter here. And finally, we've continued our purchase activity into the second quarter, and we continue to operate, notwithstanding this at very high levels of cash at the Fed that can be deployed over time in loans or securities based on market opportunities. While not a surprise, the quarter was impacted by continued weak loan demand in the face of strong bond market issuance levels, pay downs and competition resulting in historically low utilization levels. Based on the strength of the U.S. economy, we would expect to see loan demand improve and ultimately drive utilization rates higher over time. We continue to execute well against our strategic priorities, including our national expansion, which will significantly accelerate through our pending acquisition of BBVA USA. We're making good progress on BBVA integration planning and are on track for a midyear close, pending regulatory approval. We haven't found any significant surprises regarding the quality or nature of BBVA's business, and our employees are working effectively with their BBVA counterparts on everything, including the technology conversion. With the quality of BBVA markets, especially in their largest market, in Texas -- and the quality of their largest markets, especially in Texas, and is proving to be everything we hoped it would. As we planned for the integration of BBVA USA, we continue to invest in and leverage our own technology so that we can better serve our customers. Yes. And Betsy, the only thing I would add is, you said it's kind of a goal. It's not really a goal. It's just our expectation, given the carry right now and how much cash we're sitting on that -- the reason we put that in there is that our security balances, and frankly, for the whole industry are likely to run higher as a percentage of our total assets than they have historically. And we'll keep adding to them throughout the year opportunistically as we've done. But you see that in the actions late in the fourth quarter -- sorry, late in the first quarter. If we were simply trying to drive NII, we could have front-loaded those purchases at lower yields and had NII flat. We didn't do that. We waited. Waiting turns out to have been the right thing. And you'll see us do that. You've seen us do that, but you'll see us continue to do that through the course of the year. I'd just say, look, the biggest unknown on loan growth specifically is when the inventory start -- the inventory build starts for our corporate customers. Utilization is running as much as 11 points below the peak, maybe 5 points below sort of historic averages. And even though the economy is really kind of taken off here, for whatever reason, we haven't seen the typical inventory build and CapEx that you would see in this economy, I guess just hesitancy waiting for more certainty on the pandemic. But when that happens, and it will happen, it almost mechanically has to happen, you're going to see pretty appreciable loan growth. We just don't know when that's going to be. Yes. There's so many little things. Rates moved in our favor. We're doing really well on expense opportunities, a whole variety of things, and they ended up... And our knowledge. That will obviously impact our large corporate book, which I think at the moment, has its lowest utilization rate ever. But the bulk of our book, remember, some 90-plus-percent of our clients are private companies. And so our middle market and commercial book really doesn't have access to the public markets and that cash build that you're seeing in large corporate. So I do think you'll see utilization there increase. By the way, we've seen utilization increases in our asset-based lending book but they're small. That's kind of the first place you would expect to see it. So that's encouraging. John, you're asking the question, are we going to have excess capital that can be deployed in share buybacks and other things. And the answer is, yes. I think one of the issues is supply chains have been so disrupted that people actually can't build inventory. And we're strangely being held back by demand and production capacity. I think that's going to be the case. But I think one of the things we've been careful to do and sort of framing our expectations for you guys around BBVA we recognize that there are parts of their balance sheet that we would likely shrink, both because of concentrations across the combined firm but also because there are some sectors they don't want to be in, offset by our growth in these new markets. So in the out years, I get really bullish about our growth potential. But for the first year or so, we're going to -- and we've -- this is all in sort of the numbers we gave you, there's going to be a little trade-off of we'll be growing the business we want as we shrink some of the business we won't. So the real acceleration is probably a couple of years down the road. I won't talk about what other people are doing, but we pretty much have this nailed down. We know -- and it's all in the numbers we've given you. We are going to invest in certain capacity for their branches, for example, on connectivity, faster routers, we're going to expand some of the compute capacity we have in our cloud. But all of that we've given you -- and it's not a big deal, it was all on the deal assumptions and all those thing are proving to be correct. I'm trying to figure out where you're going with that, Mike. I mean, we're going to -- once we close the deal, we'll give you some updates on numbers and so forth. I guess what I would say to you is, we remain -- I remain, and also even to a greater extent, really excited by the growth potential of this deal. We tend -- when you do a deal, you give kind of a year and a half worth of guidance when all the marvels are thrown up in the air and you're working on cost saves and integration. The potential of the franchise in these markets is phenomenal. The potential for cross-sell and for growth of new clients is phenomenal. And we're really excited by that. Yes. So the only one I can think of right off the top of my head is, our corporate finance utilization is 57% of the peak number. And I think -- I saw some.... And that's a function of all the corporate cash. That the 11-point drop was off of the high utilization we saw, Mike, with all the draws during the first quarter of last year, which is why the average maybe 5%. And it's hit -- certain areas have been impacted more than others. municipal utilization is way, way down. As I said, corporate finance is way, way down. Even our asset-based business, which typically runs fairly high utilization has really struggled just given the lack of ability to build inventory. So I don't know if you remember the number, Rob, but we've messed around with -- if you kind of regress economic growth, retail sales, a whole bunch of other different things against -- and inventory levels against loan utilization, it's in squared up over 80. And it should be growing today. We just haven't seen it. I can't give an answer as to why. That's by number. So by loan balances, it's -- I'm going to say it's half. Yes. No, it's us saying -- look, Mike, we could sit here and tell you all of them, and I've latched some of these calls. So the back half of the year is going to be great. Everything will be wonderful. I hope they're right. And if they're right, we'll do really well. But I can't promise you that.... Yes. What we show you is the stuff we know. I know that mechanically our loan balances are going to grow as the economy improves and they build inventories. I can't tell you the timing of that. By the way, nobody else can either. I don't think rising short-term rates has any impact at all. I think as a practical matter, deposit balances in the industry are driven by the size of the Fed's balance sheet and fiscal transfers, coupled with loan growth. Loan growth will actually drive more deposit balances once we see a pickup in that. And I think excess liquidity in the system is here to stay for a long period of time. Because I don't think the Fed is going to shrink their balance sheet anytime soon. So I think we're going to be in a -- there's a structural change in banking, which is going to have more liquidity, higher security balances for an extended period of time. Yes. No. I mean.... We're hardly going to dent it. I mean the chart -- you see the chart we have in there, where you see our cash balances versus security balances. But any loan growth you want in there, we're not buying the long end of the curve and we have a massive opportunity to deploy that. But as we always do, we're going to increment our way in. By the way, incrementing our way in is what gets us to that 25%. Yes. Trying to find your question. I see where you're going. I think consumer lending is going to drag C&I increase. I think consumers are really flushed with cash. You've seen retail sales. I think they continue to accelerate, by the way. But what's happening is that people who don't are buying and the people who would normally borrow are sitting on fiscal payments that they're going to have to burn through over time before you see balance growth. We're seeing massive transaction volumes. So we see it in our swipe fees in effect. But I don't know that you're going to see balanced growth. I think consumer will lag commercial. And I get back this place where inside of commercial, the smaller non-public companies and even some of the smaller public companies will continue to rely on bank balance sheets to fuel their growth. So it is a topic of interest, both on the political and regulatory side, less about competition and more about safety and soundness and data protection and fraud. And not -- I'm not referring to Chime specifically, but rather new entrants into the payment space, the exponential increase in fraud we've seen because of less robust know-your-customer rules and frankly, probably just because of the COVID environment. All of that has gathered attention of politicians and regulators. The competition side, we're happy to compete. I'm somewhat shocked actually, nobody's asked me a question about Low Cash Mode that we rolled out this -- yesterday, day before. That product is a result of years of technology investment that allows us, I think, is the only institution in the world to have effectively real-time capability of what's going on in our customers' accounts. And therefore, showing them what's going on in their accounts, and therefore, empowering them to choose what's going on in their accounts. No, fintech has that. Go back to -- because they rely on these small banks as their back office, which, in turn, are relying on 30-year-old cobalt-based mainframe-based batch process, not very exciting core processors. Get on, bring on the competition. At some point, they need to make money and to justify their existence.  Our challenge is presenting -- and we think we do this, a great proposition to our customers with ease of use and the very best products. And I think we have the technology backbone to do that. So I'm less worried about competing with somebody. I'm more worried about safety and soundness to the system and data and disruption to our customers who don't understand where data is being shared and who has access to it. Well, we've been working on this long before Coinbase went public back, we've talked to Coinbase about partnership and custody for our wealth clients. Practically, we've had a work stream around this, both for our corporate clients and treasury, but also for our wealth clients. The technology stretch isn't a big deal for us. It's more of a compliance-based issues that you would expect; and then importantly, choosing the right partners that you would choose as a trading transfer platform, and importantly, the custody platform. So that's an open and continuing dialogue here. Yes. You can imagine that for wealth clients, there'd be a lot of disclosure around. It's your own risk. We're going to get them directly. Look Mike, I think when you effectively offer your products as the low-cost provider to somebody else who owns the relationship, you've just -- you sold your soul to the devil. It's the beginning of the end of your franchise in whatever space you're playing. We need to own the customer relationship, and we need to deserve to own the customer relationship through an offering that doesn't need to have fintech platform on the front end. It's the alternative to that, right? And this is -- you heard Jamie talk about this as well. If tech gets into the space and owns client relationships, then we become a commodity provider industry with 5,000 participants, it's a disaster. You can't default to that end game. You have to own the customer. I think there's a lot of appropriate focus on data. The CFPB, I know, is working on this as our various politicians and other regulators. We need safety and soundness around data. That is the biggest systemic risk at the moment in my view. People talk about cyber, but what they're really talking about is data. And disruption of account flows, payment flows because data is corrupted. The consumer -- that, by the way, is solved, ultimately through tokenized API-based authorization at the bank for what the consumer wants to share, not through screen scraping. And we're working our way towards that. I think that's the ultimate end game. But the consumer has to be empowered to share data, but the data they want and to share it when they want. Not all the time and not everything and not to places that are otherwise, in my view, not regulated in terms of their controls around data. Yes. Thank you, everybody. Look forward to talking at the end of the second quarter. Stay safe. Looking forward to summer here, I hope you're doing the same."

        "content": "Bryan Gill: Good morning. Welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of January 18, 2023, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Demchak: Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. 2022 is a successful year for our company, and our strong performance during the year reflects the power of our Main Street bank model and our coast-to-coast franchise. For the full year, we reported $6.1 billion in net income or $13.85 per share. Inside of that, we grew loans and generated record revenue during a rapidly rising rate environment while at the same time we controlled expenses, resulting in substantial positive operating leverage for the full year 2022. Turning to our results for the fourth quarter, we generated $1.5 billion of net income or $3.47 per share. Growth in both net interest income and fee income contributed to a 4% increase in revenue. Our expenses were up 6% this quarter, primarily due to increased compensation from elevated business activity, particularly in our advisory businesses. Rob is going to provide more detail on our fourth quarter expenses as well as our outlook in a few minutes. Average loans grew 3% during the quarter, driven by growth in both commercial and consumer. For the full year, average loans were up 15%, and we continue to grow our loan book in a disciplined manner. As we look ahead, we are operating our company with the expectation for a shallow recession in 2023. Accordingly, this outlook drove an increase in our loan loss provision in the quarter and a modest build in reserves under the CECL methodology. Importantly, as the credit environment continues to trend towards normalized levels our overall credit quality metrics remain solid. I'd add that with charge-offs having been so low, it's not surprising to see volatility quarter-to-quarter and we saw this in the fourth quarter with an outsized loss on one commercial credit pushing us outside of our expected range. We continue to manage our liquidity levels to support growth. Our deposits remain relatively stable, and we've increased our wholesale borrowings to bolster liquidity. During the quarter, we returned $1.2 billion of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, bringing our total annual capital return to $6 billion. Our progress within the BBVA influence markets continues to exceed our expectations, and we see powerful growth opportunities across our lines of business in these new markets. We continue to generate new customer relationships, and we have been thrilled with the quality of bankers we've been able to hire. In summary, it was a solid fourth quarter as we further built on our post-acquisition momentum, delivered for our customers and communities across the country, generated strong financial results for our shareholders and put ourselves in a position of strength as we move into 2023. As always, I want to thank our employees for everything they do to make our success possible. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob to provide more details. Rob?\nRob Reilly: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis. Loans for the fourth quarter were $322 billion, an increase of $9 billion or 3% linked quarter. Investment securities grew $6 billion or 4%. Cash balances at the Federal Reserve totaled $30 billion and declined $1.5 billion during the quarter. And our average deposit balances were down 1%, while period-end deposits remained essentially stable. Average borrowed funds increased $15 billion as we proactively bolstered our liquidity with Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings late in the third quarter, and these are reflected in our fourth quarter average balances. On a spot basis, we increased our total borrowed funds by approximately $4 billion compared to September 30. The period-end increase was driven by $2 billion of FHLB borrowings and $3 billion of senior debt, partially offset by lower subordinated debt. At year-end, our tangible book value was $72.12 per common share, an increase of 3% linked quarter. And we remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.1% as of December 31, 2022. We continue to be well positioned with capital flexibility, during the quarter, we returned $1.2 billion of capital to shareholders through approximately $600 million of common dividends and $600 million of share repurchases or 3.8 million shares. Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Compared to the same period a year ago, average loans have increased 11%, or $33 billion, reflecting increased loan demand as well as our ability to capitalize on opportunities and our expanded coast-to-coast franchise. During the fourth quarter, we delivered solid loan growth. Loan balances averaged $322 billion, an increase of $9 billion, or 3% compared to the third quarter reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans. On a spot basis, loans grew $11 billion, or 3%. Commercial loans grew more than $9 billion at period end, driven by strong broad-based new production in both our corporate banking and asset-based lending businesses. Importantly, utilization rates within our C&IB portfolio remained stable linked quarter. Consumer loans increased $1 billion compared to September 30, driven by higher residential mortgage home equity and credit card balances, partially offset by lower auto loans and loan yields of 4.75% increased 77 basis points compared to the third quarter, driven by higher interest rates. Slide 5 covers our deposits in more detail. Throughout 2022, deposit balances have declined modestly, amidst the competitive pricing environment and inflationary pressures. Fourth quarter deposits averaged $435 billion and were generally stable linked quarter. Given the rising interest rate environment, we continue to see a shift in deposits from non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing. And as a result, at December 31, our deposit portfolio mix was 71% interest-bearing and 29% non-interest bearing. Overall, our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 1.07% during the fourth quarter. And as of December 31, our cumulative beta was 31%. Slide 6 details our securities portfolio. On an average basis, our fourth quarter securities of $143 billion grew $6 billion or 4%. The increase was largely driven by elevated purchase activity late in the third quarter, which included $3 billion of forward starting securities that settled in the fourth quarter. On a spot basis, securities were $139 billion and increased $3 billion, or 2% linked quarter. The yield on our securities portfolio increased 26 basis points to 2.36% driven by higher reinvestment yields, as well as lower premium amortization. And during the quarter, new purchase yields exceeded 4.75%. At the end of the fourth quarter, our accumulated other comprehensive income improved to $10.2 billion reflecting the accretion of unrealized losses on securities and swaps. Importantly, we continue to estimate that approximately 5% of AOCI will accrete back per quarter going forward without taking into account the impact of rate changes. Turning to the income statement on Slide 7. As you can see, fourth quarter 2022 reported net income was $1.5 billion, or $3.47 per share. Revenue was up $214 million, or 4% compared with the third quarter. Expenses increased $194 million, or 6%. Provision was $408 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of a weaker economic outlook as well as continued loan growth, which resulted in a $172 million reserve build. And our effective tax rate was 17.7%. Turning to Slide 8. We highlight our revenue trends. In 2022, total revenue was a record $21.1 billion and grew 10% or $2 billion compared to 2021. Within that, net interest income increased 22% due to both higher interest rates and strong loan growth. Non-interest income declined 5%, as lower market-sensitive fees more than offset strong card and cash management growth. Looking more closely at the fourth quarter, total revenue was $5.8 billion, an increase of 4% or $214 million linked quarter. Net interest income of $3.7 billion was up $209 million, or 6%. The benefit of higher yields on interest-earning assets and increased loan balances was partially offset by higher funding costs. And as a result, net interest margin increased 10 basis points to 2.92%. Fee income was $1.8 billion and increased $75 million, or 4% linked quarter. Looking at the detail, asset management and brokerage fees decreased $12 million, or 3% reflecting the impact of lower average equity markets. Capital Markets and Advisory revenue grew $37 million, or 12%, driven by higher merger and acquisition advisory fees, partially offset by lower loan syndication activity. Lending and deposit services increased $9 million or 3%, primarily due to higher loan commitment fees, reflecting our strong new loan production. Residential and commercial mortgage revenue increased $41 million, driven by higher RMSR valuation adjustments, partially offset by lower commercial mortgage banking activities. Other non-interest income declined $70 million linked quarter, reflecting a negative fourth quarter Visa fair value adjustment compared to a positive valuation adjustment in the third quarter, resulting in a change of $54 million. Turning to Slide 9. Our fourth quarter expenses were up $194 million, or 6% linked quarter. The growth was largely in personnel costs, which increased $138 million reflecting higher variable compensation related to increased business activity. Fourth quarter personnel costs also included market impacts on long-term incentive compensation plans, as well as seasonally higher medical benefits. The remaining balance of the increase in expenses linked quarter included higher marketing spend as well as impairments on various assets and investments. The majority of these impairments will lower our expenses going forward and are included in our expense guidance. As you know, we had a 2022 goal of $300 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program, and we exceeded that goal. Looking forward to 2023, we will be increasing our annual CIP goal to $400 million. This program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 10. Non-performing loans of $2 billion decreased $83 million or 4% compared to September 30 and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies of $1.5 billion declined $136 million, or 8% linked quarter. Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $224 million, an increase of $105 million linked quarter, driven in part by one large commercial loan credit. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans was 28 basis points in the fourth quarter. Provision for the fourth quarter was $408 million compared to $241 million in the third quarter. The increase reflected the impact of a weaker economic outlook as well as continued loan growth. During the fourth quarter, our allowance for credit losses increased $172 million, and our reserves now total $5.4 billion or 1.7% of total loans. In summary, PNC reported a strong fourth quarter and full year 2022. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we're now expecting a mild recession in 2023 resulting in a 1% decline in real GDP. Our rate path assumption includes a 25 basis point increase in Fed funds in both February and March. Following that, we expect the Fed to pause rate actions until December 2023, when we expect a 25 basis point cut. Looking ahead, our outlook for full year 2023 compared to 2022 results is as follows: we expect spot loan growth of 2% to 4%, which equates to average loan growth of 6% to 8%. Total revenue growth to be 6% to 8%. Inside of that, our expectation is for net interest income to be up in the range of 11% to 13% and non-interest income to be stable to up 1%. Expenses to be up between 2% and 4% and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. Based on this guidance, we expect we'll generate solid positive operating leverage in 2023. Looking at first quarter of 2023 compared to fourth quarter of 2022, we expect spot loans to be stable, which equates to average loan growth of 1% to 2%. Net interest income to be down 1% to 2%, reflecting two fewer days in the quarter. Fee income to be down 3% to 5% due to seasonally lower first quarter client activity. Other non-interest income to be between $200 million and $250 million, excluding net securities and Visa activity. We expect total non-interest expense to be down 2% to 4%, and we expect first quarter net charge-offs to be approximately $200 million. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning. On the managed income side, I wonder to see if you can give us a little more thought around the deposit costs potentially maybe if you can give us your updated thoughts on where the cumulative beta, I know you're in that 30 -- just over 30% now 31%, where is that going to trend to? What's your updated expectation there? And then also maybe on the non-interest-bearing mix, I know it's 29% of total deposits now. How do you expect that trending over the course of the next year?\nRob Reilly: Sure. Why don't I take the second one first in terms of the mix. Consistent with our expectations in a rising rate environment, we expect the mix to go more into interest-bearing, and we're seeing that. But it's right on track. No big surprise there. We're right now at 29% non-interest-bearing. I'd imagine that over the course of '23, will go down a bit our previous low in previous cycles was around 25%. So I think that's a good way to sort of think about it. In terms of the betas, you're right. We finished the year right on top of where we expected. As you know, betas lagged past historical increases for most of '22 for us and for the industry. And going forward, we expect maybe that lag to sort of compress a bit, and we'll start tracking to historical rises, but nothing particularly unusual. And of course, we don't control that that will be an outcome.\nBill Demchak: John, if you're trying to dig into -- I made a comment at Goldman that we thought our NII might track to an annualized fourth quarter and in our guide, we look a little light to that. All of that pressure. It's not coming from funding. It's coming from the spread on loans. So, we're -- we've been surprised, I've been surprised. We just haven't seen spreads widen in corporate credit. So, I guess what I would say to you is -- there's this disconnect that something is going to give. Either corporate spreads are going to widen or our current scenario that we have forecasted for CECL is wrong. So right now, we basically guide against kind of where spreads are. Maybe we get some widening and we put in this mild recession in CECL. So, we have a little bit of disconnect in the numbers, but they are what they are.\nRob Reilly: Yes. And that gets, of course, to our guidance for the full year in terms of NII. So the upside would be, to Bill's point that loan spreads would widen as they should, if we get into the economy that everybody is prepared for.\nJohn Pancari: So that widening would provide upside to that 11% to 13%.\nBill Demchak: Yes. So, none of the change in kind of thought on NII is driven by any change in our assumption on betas or deposit growth. We had pretty healthy deposits this quarter. We think continue that. It's all on this. We have an ability, particularly in the new markets to grab a whole bunch of new clients, make new loans that are good credit loans, kind of invest into this as we've done in our new markets for years, invest into client growth. The problem is the return right now struggles because we haven't seen spreads gap the way we've seen in the public markets, the way we might expect given the economy, we're kind of forecasting.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. Okay. And then separately on the credit side, can you give us a little more color on the $100 million increase in charge-offs. What was the size of the commercial credit? What is the industry? Are you seeing any other developments related to that credit or other areas of your portfolio were flagging just given the lumpiness and the size of that one issue?\nBill Demchak: Can jump in here, right? That one credit has been staring us in the face for a while. We've been working on it. It's a credit that both BBVA and PNC we're in. So it shows up as outsized. We had big reserves against it. As you've seen in our non-performers and our delinquencies there is going down. This is kind of I don't know what you call this something going through a snake, but we've been staring at it and we charged it off and that's showing the elevation this quarter, but I wouldn't read into that.\nRob Reilly: Yes. No underlying trend or anything problematic with asset category.\nJohn Pancari: What was that industry?\nRob Reilly: Telecommunications.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nJohn McDonald: Rob, I wanted to just follow up on the NII question from John there. Can you just remind us where you are on kind of interest rate positioning? Building in small rate hikes in the beginning of the year, maybe cut later, how do rate hikes from here kind of impact you? And -- just a reminder of where you are on the swap book and how that's influencing NII today and how it rolls off would be helpful?\nRob Reilly: Well, sure. Let me -- I'll try to cover some of that, and then we can follow that up. I mean, definitely, we're positioned to benefit from the two rate hikes that we expect 25 basis points each in February and March. We do have a 25 basis point cut in December, but that won't play largely in the '23 performance. So, we're positioned well against that, and we'll grow our NII. We're pointing to between 10% and 13% in terms of that range year-over-year. I will say, when we jumped into this right away, forecasting for a full year in terms of guidance is always difficult. This year, in particular, it's more difficult than most. You've heard that sentiment from some of our peers that have already reported. Really difficult because of all the uncertainties that we all know about. So we put out what we think we can achieve. That's -- Bill and I talked a little bit about maybe some upside to that in terms of loan spreads. But everything that we know now with all the uncertainties, that's where we're positioned. No big change in terms of our rate management in terms of the swaps we've disclosed at around $40 billion or so. But of course, that's all part of how we manage the balance between our fixed and variable.\nBill Demchak: The simplest way to think about that, John, is we -- through the course of the year, the DV01 or the sensitivity we have for our long positions as if anything, decreased. So think about that in terms of both the securities book and the swap book. So we remain largely asset-sensitive, happy with that position. I mean that over time, changes with the mix of swaps and securities. The swaps themselves it's kind of irrelevant to look at them separately, but they're very short, and they roll off in big bulk -- a couple of years.\nRob Reilly: 2.5.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. And Rob, maybe as a follow-up, could you unpack a little bit of the outlook for the fee revenues that you gave for 2023, just some of the headwinds and tailwinds that are leading to that outcome on the non-interest income?\nRob Reilly: Yes. Yes. Sure, John. So just in terms of the categories where we expect to see growth capital markets, we do expect mid-single-digit growth, which is good and consistent with our expectations. Our steady Eddie, card and cash management will probably be up high single digits and then those two will be offset by continuing headwinds in our asset management, given the equity markets as well as lower mortgage production. So, you put all that together, and that's how we get into our stable to up 1% for the full year.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Bill, coming back to your thoughts on the spreads that you guys just referenced on the commercial loan book relative to the CECL outlook. I'm glad you framed it that way because I think many of us are in that camp that you just described. But in terms of the spreads, is there any capacity issues, meaning there's too much lending capacity, which has kept the spreads maybe lower than normal?\nBill Demchak: I'm not sure what's going on, to be honest with you. I mean there's -- on the smaller end in certain retail categories, which really isn't our focus. There's -- there's just irrational competition in certain asset categories. In the larger corporate space, where we have this opportunity to grow clients, particularly in the new market and ultimately cross-sell, there just hasn't been any sort of gap the way you've seen in the public markets, there hasn't been any real change. Spreads aren't going down, but there hasn't been any change at all with respect to kind of the outlook in this economy. And until -- and if there's real defaults and charge-offs, there probably won't be. So one of these things is going to give, I just don't know which one it is.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. No, I noticed in your Table 10 in the supplement, the inflows of non-performance had been pretty steady. So, there's real -- excuse me, real evidence yet. And then as a follow-up, can you just remind us your outlook for returning capital to shareholders in the upcoming year with dividends and share repurchases?\nRob Reilly: Yes. Gerard and just to finish up on that on the credit spot, to your point, in the supplement, the non-performers, but also you take a look at our NPAs and our delinquencies, which are down. So the leading indicators are still very strong. Yes, on the share repurchases, a couple of things. One is we are going to continue our share repurchase program into '23. Secondly, it will be at a reduced rate relative to what we did in 2022 and likely to be less than what we did in the fourth quarter of '22, which was $600 million. A couple of things about that, one is, why lower? One is, given all the uncertainties that we're seeing, obviously, we need to be smart and tactical in terms of our capital deployment as the year plays out. But secondly, and just logically, the rate of repurchases slows when your capital ratios go from 10% to 9%. So, we still have a lot of capital flexibility. But by definition, as we get closer to those operating guidelines, we slow the pace of repurchases. All that said, there's flexibility, as you know. So, with the stress capital buffer, we're allowed a lot of flexibility around it. And we plan to use that flexibility as circumstances present themselves.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBill Carcache: Bill and Rob. Following up on your swaps commentary, could you speak broadly to how you're thinking about downside protection in this environment? Any color you can give on where you'd expect your NIM to settle if the Fed ultimately pushes the economy into, say, a mild recession cuts rates and Fed funds normalizes, say, somewhere in the 2.5% to 3% level? That would be great.\nRob Reilly: I have to write all that down in terms of your assumptions there. The -- I would say in terms of NIM -- obviously, we get that question a lot. It's obviously an outcome. So we don't guide to it. We don't necessarily manage to it. I think when you just take a step back, you can see that we finished the quarter and finished the year at 292 -- 2.92%. That's up from all of '21 where we lived at 2.27%. So that a 65 basis point jump or so, that's occurred. We don't expect those kinds of swings going forward. So going forward, we're now probably more like 5 or 6 basis point swings off of these levels. And that's sort of the way that I think about it.\nBill Carcache: Got it. Separately, there's been some concern that we could see the mix of time deposits and non-interest-bearing deposits return not just to pre-COVID levels. But perhaps back to even pre-GFC levels in this environment. Can you speak to that risk, both broadly at the industry level and more specifically as it relates to PNC?\nBill Demchak: I mean, look, we're in a bit of an unknown environment. We have the Fed going through QT. We have the Fed absorbing deposits through their reverse repo facility. We have, at least in our case, the ability to grow loans. So you could see a scenario where deposits get scarce. We've priced some of that that's in our forward guide in terms of our best look on that, you can draw upside and downside to that kind of to Rob's point, this coming year and the years after that are -- are harder to forecast and model than some of the stability we had pre-COVID. So, we're doing our best, and you've seen our best expectations.\nRob Reilly: Yes, I think that's right. And in regard to the mix between non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing so far, the shift that has occurred is perfectly consistent with what we've seen historically and consistent with our expectations.\nBill Carcache: That's helpful, Bill and Rob. If I may squeeze in one last one. I wanted to dig in a little bit into your expectation for a weaker economic outlook and mild recession and sort of square that with your reserve rate having been basically unchanged sequentially. So it suggests that most of the reserve build was really growth driven. Maybe if the economic outlook does grow more challenging, consistent with that mild recession scenario, would it be reasonable to expect that your reserve rate could actually hold your current levels? Or would it still likely drift a little bit higher from here? Any thoughts around that would help.\nBill Demchak: Yes. So a lot of moving pieces here, but start with the basic notion that we are fully reserved for the book that we hold today against a forecast that we just -- we more heavily weighted the recessionary forecast than we had in the third quarter. And remember, the charge-offs that we took this quarter particularly the lumpier ones, we mentioned one. Those were in a large way already reserved. So our build, right, is actually more than you think. The ratio ends up the same, but we have kind of less -- we have lower non-performers inside of that total book as a percentage, maybe think of it that way. In terms of coming to that 17, and then I'd also just to remind you of our -- wherever we sit today at 17 both first day CECL to now or what we have now relative to others against the composition of our loan book. We've been at this in a fairly -- we think correctly, but nonetheless conservative process approach using CECL.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: I wanted to talk a little bit about the expense side. And I know you mentioned that there was a part of the expenses this quarter that was associated with revenue generating activities like capital markets, and so that is a net positive to PPOP. So let's leave those expenses aside. I wanted to dig in more to the expenses that did not come with commensurate revenues and understand what the drivers were behind those increasing and then talk a little bit about your outlook for 2023 off of what is now higher based on what people have been expecting coming into today.\nRob Reilly: Sure. I can start there. So in regard to the fourth quarter expenses, the biggest driver of the increase was personnel expense. And to your point, inside of that, the variable comp associated with the higher business activity. In addition to that, we did have some medical expenses that we expect seasonally, but they came in a little bit higher than what we would have expected. Outside of that...\nBill Demchak: Lane wise seasonal.\nRob Reilly: Seasonal. Well, sure. Well, essentially.\nBill Demchak: You basically burn through your...\nRob Reilly: The deductibles. Yes, the deductibles and then like the Company takes over after that. So -- and that happens, that happens seasonally this season, it was a little bit higher than what we expected. Outside of that, when you look at the marketing spend, that's sort of timing in terms of how that falls in the year, but the impairments that we took on various investments and assets, which is part of your question. There wasn't anything singular that would stand out. It was a.\nBill Demchak: Yes, there was. We wrote off everything we had to do with crypto.\nRob Reilly: Well, that was part of it. That was part of it. So maybe Bill wants to answer these questions. But I would say there wasn't anything single. There's a handful of items that we took down in technology, and that shows up in our equipment expense in occupancy, with or were some facilities that we right-sized for our space needs going forward, that kind of thing. So, on the margin\u2026\nBill Demchak: I'll talk about that.\nRob Reilly: Yes, sure. And then on the margin, the -- I'm sorry, just going into -- Bill's giving me another question, but I'd say on the margin going into '23, those impairments reduced some of our expense rates, so that sort of helped. So our guide is 2% to 4% in all of '23. That's how that all stays connected.\nBill Demchak: But it's kind of frustrating because none of the stuff in our expense line in the fourth quarter has anything to do with how we spend money. I mean the comp with new business is great. Everything else was kind of we flushed a couple tech projects that didn't work out. We right-sized occupancy, marketing went up a little bit. And then we get hit this quarter on charge-offs, which are -- I'm not going to call them artificially high. They are what they are, but they're kind of lumpy as a function of something that we've been staring at for a while that finally hits the books.\nRob Reilly: And we're largely reserved to your point.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. So as I think about the guide into next year for total expenses up 2% to 4% that is really related more towards your revenues of 6% to 8% and the crypto thing, whatever is a onetime one and done gone, that's down to zero.\nRob Reilly: And that's why -- and I said in my opening comments, we point to strong positive operating leverage in '23.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. All right. And then separately, I know we talked a little bit earlier about the capital and the fact that your CET1 has been migrating down as you've been doing some nice lending, et cetera. Just wanted to understand the RWA density, it looks like it's gone up a bit. And I just wanted to understand, is that just loan growth? Or is there something else going on there? Is there some changes in how you think about RWA factors? And then I'm just wondering like how -- what is the low on CET1 that you're willing to drive to as we think about demand for borrowing is still pretty robust.\nRob Reilly: Well, so a couple of things on that. I would say in terms of the RWA increase, it's entirely loan driven. So, we've had a lot of loan growth in '22, a lot in the fourth quarter with that 3% growth in average loans. So that's the key driver of the RWA increase. Our CET ratio is at 9.1%. We've talked about an operating guideline of between 8.5% and 9%. So, we're still above our operating guidelines and that's a good place to be.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. So 8.5% the low, really, that's how we should read it.\nRob Reilly: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKen Usdin: I was wondering if you guys could talk about the still potential for the TLAC rules that come down to the category threes and how you would be thinking about either getting ahead of that or starting to issue? Or do you just have to wait for the final notice and then consider a phase-in period?\nBill Demchak: I mean a lot of people talking about this, not a lot happening around it. Where it to happen, by the way, we disagree with it, but let's walk down the path and say somehow down the road people suggest that this should happen and there'd be a phase-in period. Practically, as we look at the growth opportunity in our company new clients loan growth against what it is likely to be a constrained ability to grow total deposits, right? You're going to see our wholesale borrowings increase. And in the course of our wholesale borrowings increase in the ordinary course of business, we're going to fulfill all our parts of that TLAC requirement. All of that is in the numbers we're talking to you about -- it'll take more than next year. But in the way we think about.\nRob Reilly: In terms of to normalize as we move towards more normalized mix.\nBill Demchak: Yes. So -- and the simplest way to think about that maybe is our wholesale debt historically ran. I don't know, in the mid...\nRob Reilly: 15% to 19%.\nBill Demchak: Yes, mid-teens, I was going to say, and we're running 5%. So if we normalize that's what home loan in there. As we normalize our borrowings through time, it's likely we're going to get -- and fulfill that requirement without purposely trying to do it. Just because that's the way we and other people will be funding institutions.\nRob Reilly: Yes. I'd just add to that, that's -- we see it on our path. It's not particularly problematic, but there's a lot to be played out. We still don't think it's necessary and there's also a reasonable chance there'd be some tailoring to it, which would be reduced in our case.\nKen Usdin: Yes. And as a follow-on to that to your point about wholesale borrowings, funding loan growth incrementally, can you just talk about how you're thinking about the securities portfolio? I know you saw some growth this quarter. I know you're getting good front book, back book on it. The percentage of earning assets is still around 28%. So how would you expect that to go vis-\u00e0-vis the use of wholesale borrowings to continue to support that growth as well?\nBill Demchak: Look, you wouldn't purposely borrow wholesale and then invest in a security to hold in your securities book. However, inside of all the requirements that we manage ourselves to, we also have liquidity requirements, LCR and the need to hold high-quality liquid assets. So, the securities book will likely fade in terms of total percentage over time simply because of loan growth that we see in some of the roll down. That securities book is part of what we have in terms of cash and liquidity to satisfy LCR. So it's -- we're not going to say, \"Hey, let's borrow some money to buy more treasuries,\" right? That isn't going to happen. But practically, we use that book to hedge the value of our deposits. We'll continue to do that, and we'll continue to do that inside of the lens of LCR and other liquidity stresses that we run.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Well, I guess in the category of no-good deed goes unpunished, I mean you did have positive operating leverage last year of 300 basis points. You're guiding for positive operating leverage this year between I guess, 200 and 600 basis points, your charge-offs were below 30 basis points every quarter. You're buying back some shares yet, your guidance from one month ago was off and your results fell 1.8 below consensus. Now don't stop giving your guidance or anything like that and were all subject to the uncertainties out there. But just a little bit more about what's changed in the past month. So I guess, unemployment, your end rate assumption, you're saying it's over 5%, maybe where that's going to. And I guess that drove some of the CECL-driven reserve part of reserves, the NII and maybe your decision to lean into the securities purchases maybe because you think this is a relative top on yields?\nBill Demchak: Yes. So, you're overcomplicating it. One thing changed from a month ago and one thing only. And that was basically the spread we thought we'd earn on new business, right? We know, Mike, that we can go out and grow loans. Our ability to gain clients, cross-sell those clients, we've never been more bullish on that. The process of doing that is not earning what we would otherwise expect in the moment because spreads have not widened, and of course, you take a full life of the loan reserve when you book that loan. That's the only thing that's really changed. The expenses this quarter are noise. The guide for next year is tempered simply by that question of whether spreads are going to rise on loans, maybe they will or our CECL analysis will be wrong. We haven't we never guide on what our provision is going to be. We talk about charge-offs and the charge-off this quarter we felt was a bit anomalous. So nothing's really changed other than the sweat factor of, hey, can I actually earn what I thought I was going to earn on new loan production. That's it.\nMike Mayo: So you're saying you're too conservative either on CECL reserves or your NII guide for the year? And.\nBill Demchak: Well, but I haven't given you a number on my CECL reserves -- right? So -- but we put in -- we worsened our economic forecast. And the simple sound bite is either spreads are going to widen or our economic forecast is wrong. I think that's a fair statement.\nRob Reilly: So, there's an inconsistent.\nMike Mayo: You give -- by the way, the CEO gauge turn out maybe to come to the economists because this is such a detailed outlook in your release about what you expect the economy and interest rates and everything else. So you give a lot of detail.\nBill Demchak: You asked a question on the securities book. It's just -- we basically stayed pretty much in the same position all year. We get to re-price the book, and you see the income coming out of the securities book growing nicely. We haven't invested into it. It's a tough market to invest into. If you are -- in effect a deposit-funded institution, right? If you want to go out and buy something today, against your marginal cost of money, you're basically carrying flat to negative. Today on the theory that the Fed is going to cut to what down the road and you got to believe that the Fed is going to go back into 2s on Fed funds, which I just fundamentally don't believe. So I think kind of the market is just on investable at the moment, and I think that's going to be figured out through the course of the year. And so, there's upside my view on that plays out in the way we run our securities book. But at the moment, there's no choosing to go along in this environment, I think, is a mistake.\nMike Mayo: One more clarification, you are reserved for your existing book of business, assuming an unemployment rate of what level? I know it's above 5%.\nRob Reilly: 5.1%.\nOperator: Yes. Our next question is from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nEbrahim Poonawala: On the NII guide, so I think you've spoken extensively about the spreads. Wanted to get how much of the inversion in the yield curve was a factor in impacting the NII outlook? And tied to that, like with the 10 years sub-340 this morning, like do you just not invest right now and wait for things to shake out? Or how do you think about balance sheet management in a world where maybe the 10 years headed to 3%, not 4% next?\nBill Demchak: Yes. So, that impacts the NII guide a bit only in terms of what our reinvestment yield is and will be when we -- when the existing security book rolls down. So you've seen the book yield on that rise from wherever to what is now 260-something.\nRob Reilly: Yes, the total book.\nBill Demchak: And that continues to increase as we -- as things roll off, we're reinvesting with high fours, five handles on securities. Look, if the 10-year goes to 3%, if you look at the five year and five years, the implication of where long-term rates really have to head for that to be true. I just don't buy. I don't think we're going to be in an environment where the Fed is bounce in short-term funds around 1%, which I just don't think it's going to happen. I think we're going to -- I think we will get inflation under control, but I think it's going to be a struggle to get it under three long-term, and I think front rates will rise will stay higher they might cut and likely will cut from some 5% level. But this assumption that they're going to cut and therefore, rates are going to go back to two or one. I just think is absurd. So therefore to me, the back end of that curve is on investable. You're right, it could rally to there. Good for the people who own it as long as it's not me.\nMike Mayo: Yes. No, that's fair. And again, I'm not saying it makes sense, but is the world we live in. And I guess tied to that, I'm not sure if you gave explicit guidance in just some of those terms of deposit growth outlook. I mean still a lot of room when we look at the loan-to-deposit ratio. Just give us a thought around how you're thinking about letting additional sort of rate-sensitive deposits run off, having a smaller balance sheet, creating more excess capital?\nBill Demchak: Look, there's obviously -- we could, in the near term, increase earnings by being less competitive with deposits and let deposits run off. We have the liquidity to do that. We could increase our loan-to-deposit ratio. The challenge with that is, in the course of doing that you're damaging your long-term franchise. So, if you're losing deposits that are not core relationship deposits that maybe that makes sense. But if you're losing customers in the process of that runoff, that's a mistake. And that's the -- that's the logic we use in figuring out how we price deposits and how we grow or maintain deposits.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That's fair. And if I may, one last question, Bill. In terms of just the macro uncertainty, how do you assess like the difference between credit normalization and whether or not we're getting into some version of a recession? Like -- can you conclusively think about that over the next few months or we're not going to know that until we are well into the depth of a downturn a few quarters from now?\nBill Demchak: We've given you our best forecast. Yes. I mean, look, there's a lot of unknowns here. Technically, we could see ourselves heading into a full employment \"recession\" because you'll have stale GDP for a couple of quarters, but unemployment not ticking up to high levels. And I don't even know how to think about that environment in terms of what charge-offs might be. I mean that's probably really low charge-off environment.\nRob Reilly: Well, it's just to your point in terms of what I said at the beginning, it's really difficult for the full year, particularly this year. We've put together what we think we can do.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Matt O'Conor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatt O'Connor: We could just circle back on some of the lumpy costs. I guess, just in aggregate, like how much were the impairment? And then I think there was also -- you had called out some lumpiness from the long-term intense plan, which I think impacts both fees and comp. If you could just kind of flesh out the aggregate lumpy costs, that would be helpful.\nRob Reilly: Yes. Without -- we don't have specific numbers. You can see them as they break down in terms of our impairments within the occupancy line and the equipment line. The long term it was just the effect of a benefit in the third quarter and then it swung against us in the fourth quarter. So not big numbers, but just the delta between the two quarters drove the increase.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. And then separately, I mean, I heard you earlier kind of reiterate the 8.5% to 9% CET1 target over time, and just any thoughts on the regional banks kind of just below your size? It seems like they're all kind of building capital close to 10%. And I don't know if it pressure behind the themes from rating agencies or regulators or just conservatism for where we are in the cycle. But any thoughts on the Company your size being able to run 9% when the ones -- obviously, the banks that are bigger are running higher, but it's just been interesting to note that the ones below you, kind of $200 billion in assets, all seem to be building closer to 10%?\nRob Reilly: Do you want to answer? Well, the only thing -- the only -- the only thoughts that I have just reacting is the guidelines are typically drawn for all banks in terms of the stress capital buffer. So how they stress -- you got to look at that. And then, it's the relative capital level to the stress levels as opposed to the absolute levels. But that's just my reaction.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. But I guess the point is like you feel comfortable with whatever kind of behind-the-scene stuff that's going on with the rating agencies, regulators, the 9% and maybe drifting down a little bit over time, but at 9% you feel hopeful with in the current environment?\nBill Demchak: Yes.\nRob Reilly: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nVivek Juneja: Just a couple of quick ones. Any color on criticized assets, how they did? How those did in the quarter?\nRob Reilly: Yes, relatively flat, not a big change at all.\nVivek Juneja: And Bill, just not to beat a dead horse to death, but the whole sort of question on NII and swaps and protection, given that you think of swaps and securities sort of synonymous later in terms of expressing your view on rates. I would expect that you're going to hold off, therefore, even on the swap side in terms of adding protection yet until you see clear signs of a lot more potential for rate cuts?\nBill Demchak: Yes. It's -- I mean it's strange to me Vivek, you're a bit of a fixed income guy, this notion of protection, I mean, what a lot of banks are doing is they'll put on forward starting swaps and they'll not have to eat negative carry in the course of doing that. And they'll hope sometime by the time those come due that there is a negative carry because there'll be a cut. So, you effectively -- I mean everything is priced at the forward curve when they do that trade. It makes no sense to me. It's the same as choosing to invest at the moment on where the yield curve is. That's my downside protection. I can buy -- we can sell it, we can use options and sell away upside and buy some downside protection. As a practical matter, we're not widely out of bounds in terms of while we're asset sensitive. We're not wildly asset sensitive. And it just doesn't feel like the moment when you're supposed to be long. Particularly, if you have a view that rates in the go-forward decade are not going to look like rates during the 2012 to 2020 year. So, that's where we sit.\nOperator: And there are no further questions on the line at this time. I'll turn the presentation back to Bryan Gill for any closing remarks.\nBryan Gill: Well, thank you all for joining the call today. If you have any other follow-ups, please reach out to the IR team, and we'll be happy to help you out. Thank you.\nBill Demchak: Thanks, everybody.\nRob Reilly: Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rob Reilly",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis. Loans for the fourth quarter were $322 billion, an increase of $9 billion or 3% linked quarter. Investment securities grew $6 billion or 4%. Cash balances at the Federal Reserve totaled $30 billion and declined $1.5 billion during the quarter. And our average deposit balances were down 1%, while period-end deposits remained essentially stable. Average borrowed funds increased $15 billion as we proactively bolstered our liquidity with Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings late in the third quarter, and these are reflected in our fourth quarter average balances. On a spot basis, we increased our total borrowed funds by approximately $4 billion compared to September 30. The period-end increase was driven by $2 billion of FHLB borrowings and $3 billion of senior debt, partially offset by lower subordinated debt. At year-end, our tangible book value was $72.12 per common share, an increase of 3% linked quarter. And we remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.1% as of December 31, 2022. We continue to be well positioned with capital flexibility, during the quarter, we returned $1.2 billion of capital to shareholders through approximately $600 million of common dividends and $600 million of share repurchases or 3.8 million shares. Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Compared to the same period a year ago, average loans have increased 11%, or $33 billion, reflecting increased loan demand as well as our ability to capitalize on opportunities and our expanded coast-to-coast franchise. During the fourth quarter, we delivered solid loan growth. Loan balances averaged $322 billion, an increase of $9 billion, or 3% compared to the third quarter reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans. On a spot basis, loans grew $11 billion, or 3%. Commercial loans grew more than $9 billion at period end, driven by strong broad-based new production in both our corporate banking and asset-based lending businesses. Importantly, utilization rates within our C&IB portfolio remained stable linked quarter. Consumer loans increased $1 billion compared to September 30, driven by higher residential mortgage home equity and credit card balances, partially offset by lower auto loans and loan yields of 4.75% increased 77 basis points compared to the third quarter, driven by higher interest rates. Slide 5 covers our deposits in more detail. Throughout 2022, deposit balances have declined modestly, amidst the competitive pricing environment and inflationary pressures. Fourth quarter deposits averaged $435 billion and were generally stable linked quarter. Given the rising interest rate environment, we continue to see a shift in deposits from non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing. And as a result, at December 31, our deposit portfolio mix was 71% interest-bearing and 29% non-interest bearing. Overall, our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 1.07% during the fourth quarter. And as of December 31, our cumulative beta was 31%. Slide 6 details our securities portfolio. On an average basis, our fourth quarter securities of $143 billion grew $6 billion or 4%. The increase was largely driven by elevated purchase activity late in the third quarter, which included $3 billion of forward starting securities that settled in the fourth quarter. On a spot basis, securities were $139 billion and increased $3 billion, or 2% linked quarter. The yield on our securities portfolio increased 26 basis points to 2.36% driven by higher reinvestment yields, as well as lower premium amortization. And during the quarter, new purchase yields exceeded 4.75%. At the end of the fourth quarter, our accumulated other comprehensive income improved to $10.2 billion reflecting the accretion of unrealized losses on securities and swaps. Importantly, we continue to estimate that approximately 5% of AOCI will accrete back per quarter going forward without taking into account the impact of rate changes. Turning to the income statement on Slide 7. As you can see, fourth quarter 2022 reported net income was $1.5 billion, or $3.47 per share. Revenue was up $214 million, or 4% compared with the third quarter. Expenses increased $194 million, or 6%. Provision was $408 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of a weaker economic outlook as well as continued loan growth, which resulted in a $172 million reserve build. And our effective tax rate was 17.7%. Turning to Slide 8. We highlight our revenue trends. In 2022, total revenue was a record $21.1 billion and grew 10% or $2 billion compared to 2021. Within that, net interest income increased 22% due to both higher interest rates and strong loan growth. Non-interest income declined 5%, as lower market-sensitive fees more than offset strong card and cash management growth. Looking more closely at the fourth quarter, total revenue was $5.8 billion, an increase of 4% or $214 million linked quarter. Net interest income of $3.7 billion was up $209 million, or 6%. The benefit of higher yields on interest-earning assets and increased loan balances was partially offset by higher funding costs. And as a result, net interest margin increased 10 basis points to 2.92%. Fee income was $1.8 billion and increased $75 million, or 4% linked quarter. Looking at the detail, asset management and brokerage fees decreased $12 million, or 3% reflecting the impact of lower average equity markets. Capital Markets and Advisory revenue grew $37 million, or 12%, driven by higher merger and acquisition advisory fees, partially offset by lower loan syndication activity. Lending and deposit services increased $9 million or 3%, primarily due to higher loan commitment fees, reflecting our strong new loan production. Residential and commercial mortgage revenue increased $41 million, driven by higher RMSR valuation adjustments, partially offset by lower commercial mortgage banking activities. Other non-interest income declined $70 million linked quarter, reflecting a negative fourth quarter Visa fair value adjustment compared to a positive valuation adjustment in the third quarter, resulting in a change of $54 million. Turning to Slide 9. Our fourth quarter expenses were up $194 million, or 6% linked quarter. The growth was largely in personnel costs, which increased $138 million reflecting higher variable compensation related to increased business activity. Fourth quarter personnel costs also included market impacts on long-term incentive compensation plans, as well as seasonally higher medical benefits. The remaining balance of the increase in expenses linked quarter included higher marketing spend as well as impairments on various assets and investments. The majority of these impairments will lower our expenses going forward and are included in our expense guidance. As you know, we had a 2022 goal of $300 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program, and we exceeded that goal. Looking forward to 2023, we will be increasing our annual CIP goal to $400 million. This program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 10. Non-performing loans of $2 billion decreased $83 million or 4% compared to September 30 and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies of $1.5 billion declined $136 million, or 8% linked quarter. Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $224 million, an increase of $105 million linked quarter, driven in part by one large commercial loan credit. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans was 28 basis points in the fourth quarter. Provision for the fourth quarter was $408 million compared to $241 million in the third quarter. The increase reflected the impact of a weaker economic outlook as well as continued loan growth. During the fourth quarter, our allowance for credit losses increased $172 million, and our reserves now total $5.4 billion or 1.7% of total loans. In summary, PNC reported a strong fourth quarter and full year 2022. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we're now expecting a mild recession in 2023 resulting in a 1% decline in real GDP. Our rate path assumption includes a 25 basis point increase in Fed funds in both February and March. Following that, we expect the Fed to pause rate actions until December 2023, when we expect a 25 basis point cut. Looking ahead, our outlook for full year 2023 compared to 2022 results is as follows: we expect spot loan growth of 2% to 4%, which equates to average loan growth of 6% to 8%. Total revenue growth to be 6% to 8%. Inside of that, our expectation is for net interest income to be up in the range of 11% to 13% and non-interest income to be stable to up 1%. Expenses to be up between 2% and 4% and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. Based on this guidance, we expect we'll generate solid positive operating leverage in 2023. Looking at first quarter of 2023 compared to fourth quarter of 2022, we expect spot loans to be stable, which equates to average loan growth of 1% to 2%. Net interest income to be down 1% to 2%, reflecting two fewer days in the quarter. Fee income to be down 3% to 5% due to seasonally lower first quarter client activity. Other non-interest income to be between $200 million and $250 million, excluding net securities and Visa activity. We expect total non-interest expense to be down 2% to 4%, and we expect first quarter net charge-offs to be approximately $200 million. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions. Sure. Why don't I take the second one first in terms of the mix. Consistent with our expectations in a rising rate environment, we expect the mix to go more into interest-bearing, and we're seeing that. But it's right on track. No big surprise there. We're right now at 29% non-interest-bearing. I'd imagine that over the course of '23, will go down a bit our previous low in previous cycles was around 25%. So I think that's a good way to sort of think about it. In terms of the betas, you're right. We finished the year right on top of where we expected. As you know, betas lagged past historical increases for most of '22 for us and for the industry. And going forward, we expect maybe that lag to sort of compress a bit, and we'll start tracking to historical rises, but nothing particularly unusual. And of course, we don't control that that will be an outcome. Yes. And that gets, of course, to our guidance for the full year in terms of NII. So the upside would be, to Bill's point that loan spreads would widen as they should, if we get into the economy that everybody is prepared for. Yes. No underlying trend or anything problematic with asset category. Telecommunications. Well, sure. Let me -- I'll try to cover some of that, and then we can follow that up. I mean, definitely, we're positioned to benefit from the two rate hikes that we expect 25 basis points each in February and March. We do have a 25 basis point cut in December, but that won't play largely in the '23 performance. So, we're positioned well against that, and we'll grow our NII. We're pointing to between 10% and 13% in terms of that range year-over-year. I will say, when we jumped into this right away, forecasting for a full year in terms of guidance is always difficult. This year, in particular, it's more difficult than most. You've heard that sentiment from some of our peers that have already reported. Really difficult because of all the uncertainties that we all know about. So we put out what we think we can achieve. That's -- Bill and I talked a little bit about maybe some upside to that in terms of loan spreads. But everything that we know now with all the uncertainties, that's where we're positioned. No big change in terms of our rate management in terms of the swaps we've disclosed at around $40 billion or so. But of course, that's all part of how we manage the balance between our fixed and variable. 2.5. Yes. Yes. Sure, John. So just in terms of the categories where we expect to see growth capital markets, we do expect mid-single-digit growth, which is good and consistent with our expectations. Our steady Eddie, card and cash management will probably be up high single digits and then those two will be offset by continuing headwinds in our asset management, given the equity markets as well as lower mortgage production. So, you put all that together, and that's how we get into our stable to up 1% for the full year. Yes. Gerard and just to finish up on that on the credit spot, to your point, in the supplement, the non-performers, but also you take a look at our NPAs and our delinquencies, which are down. So the leading indicators are still very strong. Yes, on the share repurchases, a couple of things. One is we are going to continue our share repurchase program into '23. Secondly, it will be at a reduced rate relative to what we did in 2022 and likely to be less than what we did in the fourth quarter of '22, which was $600 million. A couple of things about that, one is, why lower? One is, given all the uncertainties that we're seeing, obviously, we need to be smart and tactical in terms of our capital deployment as the year plays out. But secondly, and just logically, the rate of repurchases slows when your capital ratios go from 10% to 9%. So, we still have a lot of capital flexibility. But by definition, as we get closer to those operating guidelines, we slow the pace of repurchases. All that said, there's flexibility, as you know. So, with the stress capital buffer, we're allowed a lot of flexibility around it. And we plan to use that flexibility as circumstances present themselves. I have to write all that down in terms of your assumptions there. The -- I would say in terms of NIM -- obviously, we get that question a lot. It's obviously an outcome. So we don't guide to it. We don't necessarily manage to it. I think when you just take a step back, you can see that we finished the quarter and finished the year at 292 -- 2.92%. That's up from all of '21 where we lived at 2.27%. So that a 65 basis point jump or so, that's occurred. We don't expect those kinds of swings going forward. So going forward, we're now probably more like 5 or 6 basis point swings off of these levels. And that's sort of the way that I think about it. Yes, I think that's right. And in regard to the mix between non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing so far, the shift that has occurred is perfectly consistent with what we've seen historically and consistent with our expectations. Sure. I can start there. So in regard to the fourth quarter expenses, the biggest driver of the increase was personnel expense. And to your point, inside of that, the variable comp associated with the higher business activity. In addition to that, we did have some medical expenses that we expect seasonally, but they came in a little bit higher than what we would have expected. Outside of that... Seasonal. Well, sure. Well, essentially. The deductibles. Yes, the deductibles and then like the Company takes over after that. So -- and that happens, that happens seasonally this season, it was a little bit higher than what we expected. Outside of that, when you look at the marketing spend, that's sort of timing in terms of how that falls in the year, but the impairments that we took on various investments and assets, which is part of your question. There wasn't anything singular that would stand out. It was a. Well, that was part of it. That was part of it. So maybe Bill wants to answer these questions. But I would say there wasn't anything single. There's a handful of items that we took down in technology, and that shows up in our equipment expense in occupancy, with or were some facilities that we right-sized for our space needs going forward, that kind of thing. So, on the margin... Yes, sure. And then on the margin, the -- I'm sorry, just going into -- Bill's giving me another question, but I'd say on the margin going into '23, those impairments reduced some of our expense rates, so that sort of helped. So our guide is 2% to 4% in all of '23. That's how that all stays connected. And we're largely reserved to your point. And that's why -- and I said in my opening comments, we point to strong positive operating leverage in '23. Well, so a couple of things on that. I would say in terms of the RWA increase, it's entirely loan driven. So, we've had a lot of loan growth in '22, a lot in the fourth quarter with that 3% growth in average loans. So that's the key driver of the RWA increase. Our CET ratio is at 9.1%. We've talked about an operating guideline of between 8.5% and 9%. So, we're still above our operating guidelines and that's a good place to be. Yes. In terms of to normalize as we move towards more normalized mix. 15% to 19%. Yes. I'd just add to that, that's -- we see it on our path. It's not particularly problematic, but there's a lot to be played out. We still don't think it's necessary and there's also a reasonable chance there'd be some tailoring to it, which would be reduced in our case. So, there's an inconsistent. 5.1%. Yes, the total book. Well, it's just to your point in terms of what I said at the beginning, it's really difficult for the full year, particularly this year. We've put together what we think we can do. Yes. Without -- we don't have specific numbers. You can see them as they break down in terms of our impairments within the occupancy line and the equipment line. The long term it was just the effect of a benefit in the third quarter and then it swung against us in the fourth quarter. So not big numbers, but just the delta between the two quarters drove the increase. Do you want to answer? Well, the only thing -- the only -- the only thoughts that I have just reacting is the guidelines are typically drawn for all banks in terms of the stress capital buffer. So how they stress -- you got to look at that. And then, it's the relative capital level to the stress levels as opposed to the absolute levels. But that's just my reaction. Yes. Yes, relatively flat, not a big change at all. Thank you."

            "name": "Bill Demchak",
            "content": "Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. 2022 is a successful year for our company, and our strong performance during the year reflects the power of our Main Street bank model and our coast-to-coast franchise. For the full year, we reported $6.1 billion in net income or $13.85 per share. Inside of that, we grew loans and generated record revenue during a rapidly rising rate environment while at the same time we controlled expenses, resulting in substantial positive operating leverage for the full year 2022. Turning to our results for the fourth quarter, we generated $1.5 billion of net income or $3.47 per share. Growth in both net interest income and fee income contributed to a 4% increase in revenue. Our expenses were up 6% this quarter, primarily due to increased compensation from elevated business activity, particularly in our advisory businesses. Rob is going to provide more detail on our fourth quarter expenses as well as our outlook in a few minutes. Average loans grew 3% during the quarter, driven by growth in both commercial and consumer. For the full year, average loans were up 15%, and we continue to grow our loan book in a disciplined manner. As we look ahead, we are operating our company with the expectation for a shallow recession in 2023. Accordingly, this outlook drove an increase in our loan loss provision in the quarter and a modest build in reserves under the CECL methodology. Importantly, as the credit environment continues to trend towards normalized levels our overall credit quality metrics remain solid. I'd add that with charge-offs having been so low, it's not surprising to see volatility quarter-to-quarter and we saw this in the fourth quarter with an outsized loss on one commercial credit pushing us outside of our expected range. We continue to manage our liquidity levels to support growth. Our deposits remain relatively stable, and we've increased our wholesale borrowings to bolster liquidity. During the quarter, we returned $1.2 billion of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, bringing our total annual capital return to $6 billion. Our progress within the BBVA influence markets continues to exceed our expectations, and we see powerful growth opportunities across our lines of business in these new markets. We continue to generate new customer relationships, and we have been thrilled with the quality of bankers we've been able to hire. In summary, it was a solid fourth quarter as we further built on our post-acquisition momentum, delivered for our customers and communities across the country, generated strong financial results for our shareholders and put ourselves in a position of strength as we move into 2023. As always, I want to thank our employees for everything they do to make our success possible. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob to provide more details. Rob? John, if you're trying to dig into -- I made a comment at Goldman that we thought our NII might track to an annualized fourth quarter and in our guide, we look a little light to that. All of that pressure. It's not coming from funding. It's coming from the spread on loans. So, we're -- we've been surprised, I've been surprised. We just haven't seen spreads widen in corporate credit. So, I guess what I would say to you is -- there's this disconnect that something is going to give. Either corporate spreads are going to widen or our current scenario that we have forecasted for CECL is wrong. So right now, we basically guide against kind of where spreads are. Maybe we get some widening and we put in this mild recession in CECL. So, we have a little bit of disconnect in the numbers, but they are what they are. Yes. So, none of the change in kind of thought on NII is driven by any change in our assumption on betas or deposit growth. We had pretty healthy deposits this quarter. We think continue that. It's all on this. We have an ability, particularly in the new markets to grab a whole bunch of new clients, make new loans that are good credit loans, kind of invest into this as we've done in our new markets for years, invest into client growth. The problem is the return right now struggles because we haven't seen spreads gap the way we've seen in the public markets, the way we might expect given the economy, we're kind of forecasting. Can jump in here, right? That one credit has been staring us in the face for a while. We've been working on it. It's a credit that both BBVA and PNC we're in. So it shows up as outsized. We had big reserves against it. As you've seen in our non-performers and our delinquencies there is going down. This is kind of I don't know what you call this something going through a snake, but we've been staring at it and we charged it off and that's showing the elevation this quarter, but I wouldn't read into that. The simplest way to think about that, John, is we -- through the course of the year, the DV01 or the sensitivity we have for our long positions as if anything, decreased. So think about that in terms of both the securities book and the swap book. So we remain largely asset-sensitive, happy with that position. I mean that over time, changes with the mix of swaps and securities. The swaps themselves it's kind of irrelevant to look at them separately, but they're very short, and they roll off in big bulk -- a couple of years. I'm not sure what's going on, to be honest with you. I mean there's -- on the smaller end in certain retail categories, which really isn't our focus. There's -- there's just irrational competition in certain asset categories. In the larger corporate space, where we have this opportunity to grow clients, particularly in the new market and ultimately cross-sell, there just hasn't been any sort of gap the way you've seen in the public markets, there hasn't been any real change. Spreads aren't going down, but there hasn't been any change at all with respect to kind of the outlook in this economy. And until -- and if there's real defaults and charge-offs, there probably won't be. So one of these things is going to give, I just don't know which one it is. I mean, look, we're in a bit of an unknown environment. We have the Fed going through QT. We have the Fed absorbing deposits through their reverse repo facility. We have, at least in our case, the ability to grow loans. So you could see a scenario where deposits get scarce. We've priced some of that that's in our forward guide in terms of our best look on that, you can draw upside and downside to that kind of to Rob's point, this coming year and the years after that are -- are harder to forecast and model than some of the stability we had pre-COVID. So, we're doing our best, and you've seen our best expectations. Yes. So a lot of moving pieces here, but start with the basic notion that we are fully reserved for the book that we hold today against a forecast that we just -- we more heavily weighted the recessionary forecast than we had in the third quarter. And remember, the charge-offs that we took this quarter particularly the lumpier ones, we mentioned one. Those were in a large way already reserved. So our build, right, is actually more than you think. The ratio ends up the same, but we have kind of less -- we have lower non-performers inside of that total book as a percentage, maybe think of it that way. In terms of coming to that 17, and then I'd also just to remind you of our -- wherever we sit today at 17 both first day CECL to now or what we have now relative to others against the composition of our loan book. We've been at this in a fairly -- we think correctly, but nonetheless conservative process approach using CECL. Lane wise seasonal. You basically burn through your... Yes, there was. We wrote off everything we had to do with crypto. I'll talk about that. But it's kind of frustrating because none of the stuff in our expense line in the fourth quarter has anything to do with how we spend money. I mean the comp with new business is great. Everything else was kind of we flushed a couple tech projects that didn't work out. We right-sized occupancy, marketing went up a little bit. And then we get hit this quarter on charge-offs, which are -- I'm not going to call them artificially high. They are what they are, but they're kind of lumpy as a function of something that we've been staring at for a while that finally hits the books. I mean a lot of people talking about this, not a lot happening around it. Where it to happen, by the way, we disagree with it, but let's walk down the path and say somehow down the road people suggest that this should happen and there'd be a phase-in period. Practically, as we look at the growth opportunity in our company new clients loan growth against what it is likely to be a constrained ability to grow total deposits, right? You're going to see our wholesale borrowings increase. And in the course of our wholesale borrowings increase in the ordinary course of business, we're going to fulfill all our parts of that TLAC requirement. All of that is in the numbers we're talking to you about -- it'll take more than next year. But in the way we think about. Yes. So -- and the simplest way to think about that maybe is our wholesale debt historically ran. I don't know, in the mid... Yes, mid-teens, I was going to say, and we're running 5%. So if we normalize that's what home loan in there. As we normalize our borrowings through time, it's likely we're going to get -- and fulfill that requirement without purposely trying to do it. Just because that's the way we and other people will be funding institutions. Look, you wouldn't purposely borrow wholesale and then invest in a security to hold in your securities book. However, inside of all the requirements that we manage ourselves to, we also have liquidity requirements, LCR and the need to hold high-quality liquid assets. So, the securities book will likely fade in terms of total percentage over time simply because of loan growth that we see in some of the roll down. That securities book is part of what we have in terms of cash and liquidity to satisfy LCR. So it's -- we're not going to say, \"Hey, let's borrow some money to buy more treasuries,\" right? That isn't going to happen. But practically, we use that book to hedge the value of our deposits. We'll continue to do that, and we'll continue to do that inside of the lens of LCR and other liquidity stresses that we run. Yes. So, you're overcomplicating it. One thing changed from a month ago and one thing only. And that was basically the spread we thought we'd earn on new business, right? We know, Mike, that we can go out and grow loans. Our ability to gain clients, cross-sell those clients, we've never been more bullish on that. The process of doing that is not earning what we would otherwise expect in the moment because spreads have not widened, and of course, you take a full life of the loan reserve when you book that loan. That's the only thing that's really changed. The expenses this quarter are noise. The guide for next year is tempered simply by that question of whether spreads are going to rise on loans, maybe they will or our CECL analysis will be wrong. We haven't we never guide on what our provision is going to be. We talk about charge-offs and the charge-off this quarter we felt was a bit anomalous. So nothing's really changed other than the sweat factor of, hey, can I actually earn what I thought I was going to earn on new loan production. That's it. Well, but I haven't given you a number on my CECL reserves -- right? So -- but we put in -- we worsened our economic forecast. And the simple sound bite is either spreads are going to widen or our economic forecast is wrong. I think that's a fair statement. You asked a question on the securities book. It's just -- we basically stayed pretty much in the same position all year. We get to re-price the book, and you see the income coming out of the securities book growing nicely. We haven't invested into it. It's a tough market to invest into. If you are -- in effect a deposit-funded institution, right? If you want to go out and buy something today, against your marginal cost of money, you're basically carrying flat to negative. Today on the theory that the Fed is going to cut to what down the road and you got to believe that the Fed is going to go back into 2s on Fed funds, which I just fundamentally don't believe. So I think kind of the market is just on investable at the moment, and I think that's going to be figured out through the course of the year. And so, there's upside my view on that plays out in the way we run our securities book. But at the moment, there's no choosing to go along in this environment, I think, is a mistake. Yes. So, that impacts the NII guide a bit only in terms of what our reinvestment yield is and will be when we -- when the existing security book rolls down. So you've seen the book yield on that rise from wherever to what is now 260-something. And that continues to increase as we -- as things roll off, we're reinvesting with high fours, five handles on securities. Look, if the 10-year goes to 3%, if you look at the five year and five years, the implication of where long-term rates really have to head for that to be true. I just don't buy. I don't think we're going to be in an environment where the Fed is bounce in short-term funds around 1%, which I just don't think it's going to happen. I think we're going to -- I think we will get inflation under control, but I think it's going to be a struggle to get it under three long-term, and I think front rates will rise will stay higher they might cut and likely will cut from some 5% level. But this assumption that they're going to cut and therefore, rates are going to go back to two or one. I just think is absurd. So therefore to me, the back end of that curve is on investable. You're right, it could rally to there. Good for the people who own it as long as it's not me. Look, there's obviously -- we could, in the near term, increase earnings by being less competitive with deposits and let deposits run off. We have the liquidity to do that. We could increase our loan-to-deposit ratio. The challenge with that is, in the course of doing that you're damaging your long-term franchise. So, if you're losing deposits that are not core relationship deposits that maybe that makes sense. But if you're losing customers in the process of that runoff, that's a mistake. And that's the -- that's the logic we use in figuring out how we price deposits and how we grow or maintain deposits. We've given you our best forecast. Yes. I mean, look, there's a lot of unknowns here. Technically, we could see ourselves heading into a full employment \"recession\" because you'll have stale GDP for a couple of quarters, but unemployment not ticking up to high levels. And I don't even know how to think about that environment in terms of what charge-offs might be. I mean that's probably really low charge-off environment. Yes. Yes. It's -- I mean it's strange to me Vivek, you're a bit of a fixed income guy, this notion of protection, I mean, what a lot of banks are doing is they'll put on forward starting swaps and they'll not have to eat negative carry in the course of doing that. And they'll hope sometime by the time those come due that there is a negative carry because there'll be a cut. So, you effectively -- I mean everything is priced at the forward curve when they do that trade. It makes no sense to me. It's the same as choosing to invest at the moment on where the yield curve is. That's my downside protection. I can buy -- we can sell it, we can use options and sell away upside and buy some downside protection. As a practical matter, we're not widely out of bounds in terms of while we're asset sensitive. We're not wildly asset sensitive. And it just doesn't feel like the moment when you're supposed to be long. Particularly, if you have a view that rates in the go-forward decade are not going to look like rates during the 2012 to 2020 year. So, that's where we sit. Thanks, everybody."

Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of October 14, 2022, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Demchak: Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you've seen, we delivered another strong quarter, generating $1.6 billion of net income or $3.78 per share. The combination of continued growth in our commercial and consumer loan books and higher rates drove net interest income 14% higher and our net interest margin increased 32 basis points. By the way, that's the largest sequential increase in NIM in more than a decade. Non-interest income was also up modestly, reflecting strong private equity performance and a record quarter in loan syndications, partially offset by weaker M&A activity. We remained disciplined on the expense front, resulting in seven percentage points of positive operating leverage. Our credit quality was largely unchanged in the quarter. While we have not seen any meaningful deterioration in credit quality taking place, our provision of $241 million reflects our slightly weaker economic expectations. Our capital levels remain solid, and we returned $1.7 billion of capital to shareholders during the quarter through share repurchases and dividends. We continue to make good progress on our strategic priorities. Our new and acquired markets performed particularly well across all lines of business, and we see significant untapped opportunities across these markets. We also continue to invest in our payments capabilities to provide differentiated value. We recently acquired Linga, enhancing our capabilities to better serve restaurant and retail clients, particularly in the small business space. And during the quarter, we made enhancements across our retail platform to drive customer convenience and retention. For example, we recently announced a partnership with Allpoint to give our customers surcharge-free access to 41,000 additional ATMs from coast to coast. With this partnership, PNC now offers customers surcharge-free access to more than 60,000 PNC and partner ATMs across the country. In AMG we saw positive quarterly flows of $4 billion, driven by both the private bank and institutional asset management. We are recruiting top talent and remain focused on taking share in all of our markets. In summary, in the third quarter, we executed well as a national Main Street bank, and we are in a position of strength as we look to the future. As always, I want to thank our employees for their hard work in the third quarter and for everything they do to deliver for our customers, communities and our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob to provide more detail about our financial results.\nRob Reilly: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis. During the quarter, loan balances were $313 billion, an increase of $8 billion or 3%. Investment securities grew approximately $2 billion or 2%. Cash balances at the Federal Reserve decreased $8 billion, and our deposit balances averaged $439 billion, a decline of $7 billion or 2%. However, spot deposits were down $2.6 billion or less than 1% as lower consumer deposits were partially offset by growth in commercial deposits. At the end of the third quarter, our loan-to-deposit ratio was 72% and remains well below our pre-pandemic levels. Average borrowed funds increased $8.6 billion as we bolstered our liquidity through Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings. During the quarter, we increased our borrowings with the home loan bank by $20 billion on a spot basis. We continue to be well positioned with significant capital flexibility. During the quarter, we returned $1.7 billion of capital to shareholders through approximately $600 million of common dividends and $1.1 billion of share repurchases or 6.7 million shares. And as of September 30, 2022, our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 9.3%. Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. During the third quarter, we delivered solid loan growth across our expanded franchise. Loan balances averaged $313 billion, an increase of $8 billion or 3% compared to the second quarter, reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans. On a spot basis, loans grew $4.6 billion or 1%. Commercial loans grew $3.1 billion as strong new production more than offset the syndication of the $5 billion of high-quality short-term loans that were expected to mature in the second half of the year. Consumer loans increased $1.5 billion driven by higher residential mortgage and home equity balances, partially offset by lower auto loans. And loan yields increased 69 basis points compared to the second quarter, driven by higher interest rates. Slide 5 covers our deposits in more detail. Although average deposits declined $7 billion or 2% compared to the second quarter, spot deposits were $438 billion and declined less than 1% compared to June 30. Commercial deposits grew $1.7 billion or 1% on a spot basis, and consumer deposits declined $4.3 billion or 2%, reflecting inflationary pressures and seasonally higher spending. Given the rising interest rate environment, we've begun to see a mix shift from non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing, particularly within our commercial deposits and expect this to continue over time. However, to date, our consolidated deposit portfolio mix has remained relatively stable with 2/3 interest-bearing and 1/3 non-interest bearing. Overall, our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased 33 basis points linked quarter to 45 basis points. As of September 30, our cumulative beta was 22%, and we estimate it will increase to approximately 30% by year-end. Slide 6 details our securities portfolio. On an average basis, our securities grew $2 billion or 2% during the quarter, as we replaced maturities with higher-yielding securities. The yield on our securities portfolio increased 21 basis points to 2.1%, driven by higher reinvestment yields as well as lower premium amortization. And during the quarter, new purchase yields exceeded 4%. Throughout the course of the year, we've repositioned our securities portfolio. And as of September 30, we had 66% of our securities classified as held to maturity. While interest rates have continued to increase, this repositioning has reduced the rate of change in our AOCI. At the end of the third quarter, our accumulated other comprehensive loss was $10.5 billion, and as you know, is not included in our regulatory capital. And importantly, we expect this amount to fully accrete back over the remaining lives of the securities and swaps. As of September 30, we estimate that approximately 5% of AOCI will accrete back per quarter going forward. Turning to the income statement on Slide 7. As you can see, third quarter 2022 reported net income was $1.6 billion or $3.78 per share. Revenue was up $433 million or 8% compared with the second quarter. Expenses increased $36 million or 1%, resulting in 7% positive operating leverage linked quarter. Provision was $241 million in the third quarter, reflecting a slightly weaker economic outlook, which impacted our macroeconomic scenarios and weightings, and our effective tax rate was 19.1%. Turning to Slide 8. We highlight our revenue trends. As you can see, total revenue for the third quarter was $5.5 billion, an increase of 8% or $433 million linked quarter. Net interest income of $3.5 billion was up $424 million or 14%. The benefit of higher yields on interest-earning assets and increased loan balances was partially offset by higher funding costs. And as a result, net interest margin increased 32 basis points to 2.82%. Third quarter non-interest income of $2.1 billion increased $9 million as lower fee income was offset by an increase in other non-interest income. The decline in fee revenue was driven by lower activity in our capital markets, mortgage and asset management businesses, which was somewhat offset by continued strong performance in our lending and deposit services as well as our card and cash management fees. Growth in other non-interest income reflected higher private equity revenue as well as a $13 million positive Visa derivative fair value adjustment in the third quarter compared to a negative adjustment of $16 million in the second quarter. Turning to Slide 9. Our third quarter expenses continue to be well managed and were up 1% linked quarter. The growth reflected increased personnel expense to support business growth as well as one additional day in the quarter. As we previously stated, we have a goal to reduce costs by $300 million in 2022 through our continuous improvement program. We're now nine months into the year, and we've completed actions related to capturing more than 80% of our annual goal. And as a result, we remain confident we will achieve our full year objectives. As you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 10. And non-performing loans of $2.1 billion increased $22 million or 1% compared to June 30 and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies were $1.6 billion on September 30 at $115 million or 8% increase linked quarter. The increase was driven by elevated levels of administrative delinquencies, the majority of which have already been or are in the process of being resolved. Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $119 million, an increase of $36 million linked quarter, primarily driven by higher commercial loan net charge-offs. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans continues to be historically low at 15 basis points. Provision for the third quarter was $241 million compared to $36 million in the second quarter. The increase reflected slightly weaker economic expectations, which impacted our macroeconomic scenarios and weightings. And during the third quarter, our allowance for credit losses remained essentially stable. Our reserves now totals $5.3 billion and continued to be 1.7% of total loans. In summary, PNC reported a strong third quarter. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we expect moderate growth in the fourth quarter, resulting in 1.8% GDP growth for the full year 2022. We also expect the Fed to raise rates by an additional 125 basis points in the fourth quarter with a 75 basis point increase in November and a 50 basis point increase in December. Looking at the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2022, we expect average loan balances to increase approximately 1%. Net interest income to be up 6% to 8%, fee income to be stable to down 1%; other non-interest income to be between $200 million and $250 million, excluding net securities and Visa activity. Taking our guidance for all components of revenue into consideration, we expect total revenue to increase approximately 2%. We expect total non-interest expense to be stable to up 1%. Fourth quarter net charge-offs to be between $125 million and $175 million, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18.5%. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pancari: On the funding side, I know you saw your deposit balances pull back again on a linked-quarter basis in both average and EOP. I wonder if you can give us a little bit of color on your thoughts there on deposit growth in coming quarters as rates continue to rise and you see some mix in your funding?\nRob Reilly: John, it's Rob. Yes, so on deposits, we saw a decline in the quarter, less so on a spot basis. Actually, commercial deposits grew there at the end of the quarter, but down quarter-over-quarter. When we look forward to the next quarter, we sort of see stable to down. On the consumer side, we do expect some downward trends just reflecting what we've seen lately, which is largely spend related, somewhat seasonal, but also the inflationary pressures. And then on the commercial side, we're calling it stable. Typically, seasonally, we see commercial increase and so far in the quarter, we have seen increases. But there's a lot of forces working against that with quantitative tightening and everything that's going on. So, we're calling for stable overall, down maybe a little bit.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. That's helpful. And related to that, Rob, can you just maybe update us on how you're thinking about deposit betas in terms of your net interest income expectations and how you're thinking about the margin.\nRob Reilly: Yes, sure. Sure. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our betas are running right now at around 22%. We expect it to go to 30% by year-end.\nJohn Pancari: Right. Okay. And then in terms of the margin trajectory, just to see if you can help us with that. How we should think about that as well?\nRob Reilly: Well, I think in terms of the margin, we saw a nice increase, obviously, in the third quarter. We won't see that equivalent jump necessarily in the fourth quarter, but as the Fed continues to raise rates, we will continue to see some margin expansion.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. And then if I could just ask one more. On the buybacks, $1.1 billion for the quarter came in above your $750 million guidance. Maybe if you could just talk about expectations, the likelihood of it being $750 for next quarter? Or could you surpass that again if you have the opportunity given the share price?\nRob Reilly: Yes. So, we have been active re-purchasers of our shares. We've been operating under the stressed capital buffer framework, which allows us a lot of flexibility. We pointed to $700 or $750 as sort of our average purchase rate, which is roughly about what we've done since we reinstated our share repurchases following the acquisition of BBVA. So that's just a rule of thumb. We can do more. We can do less as conditions were. And so going forward, we'll see. We will be purchasers of our shares in the fourth quarter, the amount of which will be determined based on conditions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question from the line of Scott Siefers, Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nRobert Siefers: Maybe, Rob, I was just curious if you could talk sort of broadly or at a top level about your ability to sustain positive NII momentum once the Fed stops raising rates. And I think some of the factors or puts and takes will be sort of self-evident, but I would just be curious to hear in your words what you think the big movers are each way.\nRob Reilly: Well, I mean, I think you said it. I think it's somewhat self-evident. As the Fed continues to raise rates, we will see increases in NII. Obviously, we'll see some higher expenses on the funding part, which gets to the margin. But it will continue to go up as the Fed rates continues to raise rates, at which point they stop doing that, then things will slow down, but that's probably into '23 as we take a look at our forecast.\nBill Demchak: It's going to be a bit of a mechanical exercise. So if you assume the Fed is done, if you look at past cycles, you'll see banks continue to increase rates as deposits get scarce. So, there's a little bit of beta creation. Offsetting that, more than offsetting that in our case, because our -- the short-dated nature of our securities book is the roll down of the securities that mature and then get redeployed it to then higher yields, right? So, it will be that fight against where the deposit prices go once the Fed stops versus the roll down of the book and the re-price of the yields on the book.\nRob Reilly: Which is self-evident, yes.\nRobert Siefers: Okay. Perfect. And then if I can go back to Rob, your comments from the last question on purchase. So I guess just sort of curious, when you think of sort of the conditions and why you order wouldn't keep up the third quarter's more elevated level. It looks like you guys are among the very few that still has very good capacity to repurchase. What are you thinking? Was it just like the stock price in the third quarter? Or are you sort of just there's enough uncertainty in the macro? Or does like TCE begin to enter into the equation in addition to regulatory capital levels? What are those conditions that you guys are weighing?\nRob Reilly: Yes, sure.\nBill Demchak: Yes.\nRob Reilly: I'd say all of the above other than maybe the TCE, that's not as much of a driver because it's not part of our regulatory capital.\nBryan Gill: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Can you guys share with us? We're hearing some commentary in the commercial real estate markets that loan availability is becoming tighter, particularly to equity REITs. And you guys obviously are players in the commercial real estate market. Can you tell us what you're seeing and the risk you're assessing and what the outlook is for your commercial real estate loan book?\nBill Demchak: Just a general comment. Our exposure to REIT has grown as some of the capital markets opportunities have declined. But some REITs are risky and some aren't depending on what their underlying property types are. And we price for risk and decline risk when it's the right thing to do.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. Recognizing credit is still very strong and your non-performing asset ratios are strong. I was curious, I saw in your detail that you gave, which is some of the best out there, about increases in C&I non-performing loans. And then also, I think there was an increase in the 30- to 89-day category. I know in your press release, you talked about some processing issues. Can you expand upon that and talk a little bit about that -- those line items?\nRob Reilly: Yes. Sure. Want me to go ahead? Yes, on the delinquencies, Gerard, and I mentioned it in my comments, the increase was entirely driven by administrative delinquencies, which have largely been resolved. So delinquencies adjusted for that are essentially flat, maybe even down a little bit. On the non-performers, they are up a little bit. But as you know, we're coming up off of such, such low, low levels that some increase is inevitable and doesn't necessarily reflect a broader move.\nBill Demchak: It also jumps around.\nRob Reilly: Yes, that's right.\nBill Demchak: There is no trend in there. It's one shows up, one goes away, and it's off such a small number. It's hard to look at.\nRob Reilly: Percentage increases.\nBill Demchak: This changes quarter-to-quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKenneth Usdin: One follow-up on the NII side. I know last quarter, Bill, you had said that you continue to see the rates trajectory continue to move up. We know you had an existing -- preexisting book of swaps that you put on, you said you were going to hold off for now. I'm just wondering, if you can help us understand just the philosophy from here as we get potentially towards the high end of the rate cycle? And how the existing book works against the natural asset sensitivity? To the earlier point about can you still continue to move NII growth sequentially after the fourth quarter as we get into next year?\nBill Demchak: You have a lot embedded in that question. So start with the swaps. You will have seen, what's the number of $4 billion, $5 billion, we dropped this quarter? If you look at our overall exposure to rates, we're basically -- we're flat to even more asset sensitive to where we were six months ago. Purposely not wanting to invest into this market, so we've let stuff rolled down and kind of replace what's rolled off but not added. Our book today, I guess, our bond book has a duration of 4.6 years, swap book's, 2.5 or 6.2.3. So it all rolls down really fast. And it's rolling down off of yields that have one handles on them that get replaced today at 4.5 plus, assuming everything stops right here. So there's a big opportunity set in the re-pricing of that book and then there's an opportunity set and simply adding duration when it's the right time to do that. I don't think it's the right time to do that yet.\nKenneth Usdin: So, then you can -- you mentioned to swap, the roll down. Can you kind of just help us understand how quickly that current portfolio rolls down? And so as we go forward, should we see a lesser burden then from the 10-Q and given where rates are from that roll down going forward, is that what you're alluding to?\nBill Demchak: Yes. I mean the duration of the swap books 2.3 years, Rob saying, so it's all bullet maturity. So I'm guessing you're going to see a 30-year.\nKenneth Usdin: Okay. Got it. And at this point, you're at the point where you're out to protect further out down the road, your point, Bill, is just that you'll see how that develops at that point at which time you decide, okay, we now have to think about the downside risk?\nBill Demchak: Yes. So, we are today much more exposed to down rates than we are to operate. We make lots of money when rates go up or even if they stay just where they are here. We're underinvested, we're asset sensitive. The pieces of that you shouldn't get too hung up on. The exposure we have has fairly short maturities, both on the swap side and on the bond side. And so simply staying where we are gives us the opportunity to reinvest what matures at higher yields, whether that's swaps rolling off or bonds rolling off, and we're going to do that. We will also, at some point, add to get rid of some of the asset sensitivity. We're just not doing that yet.\nOperator: Our next question from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Does Rob get a raise because you became more asset-sensitive in the last six months?\nRob Reilly: We'll take that as an off-line item.\nMike Mayo: Okay. I guess no good deed goes unpunished. I mean your rate of growth for NII is slow in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter, quarter-over-quarter, so just follow-up on that last question. Do you think your fourth quarter NII will be a peak? Or do you think it should go higher from there because it could go lower. Because the catch up the lag of deposit pricing, maybe Q2, deposits run off, whether other factors, but other -- mitigated by some of those things about reinvesting swaps and securities. So does it go higher after the fourth quarter? Or you just don't know, what's the likelihood?\nRob Reilly: Yes.\nMike Mayo: Okay. And why did you go more asset-sensitive six months ago? I mean that's different than your peers?\nBill Demchak: Yes. I've been in a camp for a while in arguments with our economics team. That -- it was going to take a lot higher rates and inflation was going to be exactly what played out. So assuming that what's playing out is what we thought six months ago, you don't buy anything. Was that any harder than that.\nMike Mayo: Okay. And then why are deposit betas for you and really the industry outperforming? What have people gotten wrong in their modeling? When you look at your model, what hasn't taken place? Or is it just yet to take place?\nBill Demchak: Yes, I don't know the answer to that, Mike. I mean the consumer money is stickier than everybody.\nRob Reilly: That's the answer. That's relative to our expectations the consumers moved more slowly than we would have thought.\nBill Demchak: Yes. Corporates are kind of doing what you would otherwise expect depending on their size. Money market yields are doing what you'd otherwise expect, so you have a set of boundaries on competition from money funds have a set of boundaries and competition from high-rate deposit accounts, the online deposit accounts. So it's really just the re-pricing of the core consumer just occurs slower than I think the industry assumed.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBill Carcache: Bill, you said that you don't think it's time to add duration yet. Can you give some color on the trigger you're looking for?\nBill Demchak: I would tell you that we're probably getting close, but I continue to think and we've seen a lot of this play out at the back end of the curve is going to sell off here. I mean my base expectation is that it's going to be tough to get inflation down. They even have a two handle on it. But I do think the Fed is going to pause at some point. When they do that, inflation is still sticky and I think you're going to see the curve flatten. So I just -- it's tough to want to lock in term rates at the moment and essentially eat negative carry three months from now.\nRob Reilly: Or longer.\nBill Demchak: No, you'd go negative in three months based on foresight. So, we need to see some semblance of when and how the Fed is going to stop and whether or not inflation is really move towards two or just kind of gotten down to the low 3s and sticks there, which is what I'm afraid might happen.\nBill Carcache: Understood. That's really helpful. Separately, many banks talked about deposit growth that they're generating under QE as their expectation that it would be sticky. Some others were less certain. Can you speak to that dynamic broadly at the industry level? And then maybe specifically, whether you expect PNC's interest-bearing versus non-interest-bearing deposits to ultimately remix back to pre-COVID levels?\nRob Reilly: Yes. I mean, well, for the industry, it's all pretty straightforward. You see it there. I would say following -- at the altitude you're asking the question, following the flood of liquidity and deposits in the system, we're going to see those recede. And then in regard to the mix between net interest-bearing and -- or non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing, we'll see that shift. We're already starting to see it on the corporate side, but the bulk of our deposits in terms of the core deposits, it's the same ratio of 33% non-interest-bearing, two-thirds interest-bearing.\nBill Carcache: Got it. And on your debt as a percentage of your overall funding that ticked up a little bit this quarter, but it's still below 4Q '19. Is it reasonable to expect that's going to remix back to pre-COVID levels?\nBill Demchak: You have to -- I mean, at some point in time, you would expect that to occur. That's a function of where you think liquidity is going to go from the deposit side, but I don't know what time line that would otherwise follow.\nBill Carcache: Okay. That helps. And then finally, when the tailoring rules were coming together, you guys did a good job of articulating why Main Street banks like yourselves don't pose systemic risk to the financial system. Can you speak to some of what's happening now and how you're positioned for the risk that regulatory scrutiny could intensify somewhat for the super regionals?\nRob Reilly: So on the TLAC and SPOE issue.\nBill Carcache: Yes.\nRob Reilly: Yes. Well, Bill, you want to open up and I could add color. Well, just a couple of thoughts. I mean one is, obviously, there's a lot of conversation about it. But at this point, there's no formal proposals or anything to look at. So from our view, it's just observations and speculation. If we observe what's in place with the G-SIBs, our conclusion is it's not necessary for large regional banks, to your point, we thought that came through in the tailoring 95% plus of what we do is within the bank.\nBill Demchak: 99%.\nRob Reilly: 99%, well -- that's 95% plus. So again, a simple structure, and it's unclear to us why an SPOE would need to be on top of what's already in place with the FDIC and the deposit insurance fund. So that has us a bit perplexed.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Rose with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rose: I was hoping to get some color on the health of your borrowers at this point and maybe if there's any unwillingness to lend into certain asset class at this point. I'm hearing more and more on the construction side, the banks are pulling back. We just love any updates that you have on the commercial and the consumer side?\nBill Demchak: I'm not sure what you're referring to about construction. But broadly, we haven't seen any change in our credit book. I mean, we're seeing balances increase in credit card, which is a good thing. So people are finally drawing down on credit. But we really haven't seen deterioration in the performance of the book across anything. In terms of what we lend to, we just don't -- we don't change our credit box. We have a set of criteria that we lend to will change price and certain asset classes, prices are going up or in certain classes. Auto is an example where spreads are just too tight relative to where we want to lend. I can't think of any other examples where...\nRob Reilly: No, no. And we operate, as you know, mostly in the higher point of the spectrum in terms of credit quality. So investment grade and prime space and consumer approach is the same.\nBill Demchak: But if it's real estate construction, we've been active in the multifamily side. If you're looking at sort of smaller real estate...\nRob Reilly: Higher risk, yes, we were never there.\nBill Demchak: We were never in that business to begin with. Yes. That's kind of a smaller bank activity.\nMichael Rose: All right. Maybe just one follow-up. I appreciate the fourth quarter guide. I think as it relates to PPNR for the full year, it seems like even with the fourth quarter guide, maybe being a little bit softer than where consensus was, you guys are squarely within the ranges for full year revenue and non-interest expense. Is that the way we should be reading it?\nRob Reilly: Yes.\nBill Demchak: Yes.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nNathan Stein: This is Nathan Stein on behalf of Matt O'Connor. So 3Q capital markets fees came down versus the really strong 2Q levels, but I think that makes sense just given the macro backdrop. Can you talk about the capital markets outlook from here?\nRob Reilly: Sure. Well, the decline in the third quarter was more than just the macroeconomic backdrop. It was off of elevated levels of our Harris Williams unit in the second quarter, which were in effect. We did most of our activity in the first half in the second quarter with Harris Williams. So we knew that, we called that, and we put that into our guidance. And then just going forward in terms of our capital markets view, Harris Williams is the biggest component. Their pipeline is very big. The degree to which they do more or less deals remains to be seen. Our view for the broader category is flattish to down and recognizing there could be some upside or downside depending on the macroeconomic factors you talk about.\nBill Demchak: Inside of that space, we actually had a record quarter in loan syndications. And we had a record quarter in middle market loan originations, which is related to that. So there's actually a lot of activity, particularly as the bond markets are drying up that benefits us. Harris Williams just was a big number in the second quarter. So when you're going off of that base, it's not as if the core underlying business, ex-Harris Williams is strong and it's actually doing quite well. And the M&A market at the moment is tough.\nOperator: We appear to have a follow-up from John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pancari: Just real quick on the capital markets revenue on the Harris Williams, can you just remind us what the comp ratio is in that business? And then separately, I just want to see if you can maybe walk through a bit of the outlook for the other larger line items in non-interest income, including the asset management and cash management and others.\nRob Reilly: Yes. So I mean your question is just around in terms of the fees. In the Harris Williams line item, our efficiency ratio is probably in the mid-70s, just roughly plus or minus. In regard to the outlook in terms of the fees, we'll see -- obviously, I'll just go through the categories, asset management is probably going to see some headwinds. You can see what's going on in the equity markets, although any given day, who knows, but we'll be under some pressure. Mortgage obviously included in that. Card and cash management will continue to be strong. We have solid fundamentals there, and that's a steady Eddie, which will continue to expand. And then capital markets, I just spoke about. We sort of see it stable. We could outperform if people want to do deals. The pipeline is there, but it's just -- it's a question of whether the next 90 days, it occurs.\nOperator: And we appear to have no further questions on the phone line.\nBryan Gill: Okay. Well, thank you for joining the call today. And if you have any further follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to the IR team. Thank you and have a good day.\nRob Reilly: Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rob Reilly",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis. During the quarter, loan balances were $313 billion, an increase of $8 billion or 3%. Investment securities grew approximately $2 billion or 2%. Cash balances at the Federal Reserve decreased $8 billion, and our deposit balances averaged $439 billion, a decline of $7 billion or 2%. However, spot deposits were down $2.6 billion or less than 1% as lower consumer deposits were partially offset by growth in commercial deposits. At the end of the third quarter, our loan-to-deposit ratio was 72% and remains well below our pre-pandemic levels. Average borrowed funds increased $8.6 billion as we bolstered our liquidity through Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings. During the quarter, we increased our borrowings with the home loan bank by $20 billion on a spot basis. We continue to be well positioned with significant capital flexibility. During the quarter, we returned $1.7 billion of capital to shareholders through approximately $600 million of common dividends and $1.1 billion of share repurchases or 6.7 million shares. And as of September 30, 2022, our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 9.3%. Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. During the third quarter, we delivered solid loan growth across our expanded franchise. Loan balances averaged $313 billion, an increase of $8 billion or 3% compared to the second quarter, reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans. On a spot basis, loans grew $4.6 billion or 1%. Commercial loans grew $3.1 billion as strong new production more than offset the syndication of the $5 billion of high-quality short-term loans that were expected to mature in the second half of the year. Consumer loans increased $1.5 billion driven by higher residential mortgage and home equity balances, partially offset by lower auto loans. And loan yields increased 69 basis points compared to the second quarter, driven by higher interest rates. Slide 5 covers our deposits in more detail. Although average deposits declined $7 billion or 2% compared to the second quarter, spot deposits were $438 billion and declined less than 1% compared to June 30. Commercial deposits grew $1.7 billion or 1% on a spot basis, and consumer deposits declined $4.3 billion or 2%, reflecting inflationary pressures and seasonally higher spending. Given the rising interest rate environment, we've begun to see a mix shift from non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing, particularly within our commercial deposits and expect this to continue over time. However, to date, our consolidated deposit portfolio mix has remained relatively stable with 2/3 interest-bearing and 1/3 non-interest bearing. Overall, our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased 33 basis points linked quarter to 45 basis points. As of September 30, our cumulative beta was 22%, and we estimate it will increase to approximately 30% by year-end. Slide 6 details our securities portfolio. On an average basis, our securities grew $2 billion or 2% during the quarter, as we replaced maturities with higher-yielding securities. The yield on our securities portfolio increased 21 basis points to 2.1%, driven by higher reinvestment yields as well as lower premium amortization. And during the quarter, new purchase yields exceeded 4%. Throughout the course of the year, we've repositioned our securities portfolio. And as of September 30, we had 66% of our securities classified as held to maturity. While interest rates have continued to increase, this repositioning has reduced the rate of change in our AOCI. At the end of the third quarter, our accumulated other comprehensive loss was $10.5 billion, and as you know, is not included in our regulatory capital. And importantly, we expect this amount to fully accrete back over the remaining lives of the securities and swaps. As of September 30, we estimate that approximately 5% of AOCI will accrete back per quarter going forward. Turning to the income statement on Slide 7. As you can see, third quarter 2022 reported net income was $1.6 billion or $3.78 per share. Revenue was up $433 million or 8% compared with the second quarter. Expenses increased $36 million or 1%, resulting in 7% positive operating leverage linked quarter. Provision was $241 million in the third quarter, reflecting a slightly weaker economic outlook, which impacted our macroeconomic scenarios and weightings, and our effective tax rate was 19.1%. Turning to Slide 8. We highlight our revenue trends. As you can see, total revenue for the third quarter was $5.5 billion, an increase of 8% or $433 million linked quarter. Net interest income of $3.5 billion was up $424 million or 14%. The benefit of higher yields on interest-earning assets and increased loan balances was partially offset by higher funding costs. And as a result, net interest margin increased 32 basis points to 2.82%. Third quarter non-interest income of $2.1 billion increased $9 million as lower fee income was offset by an increase in other non-interest income. The decline in fee revenue was driven by lower activity in our capital markets, mortgage and asset management businesses, which was somewhat offset by continued strong performance in our lending and deposit services as well as our card and cash management fees. Growth in other non-interest income reflected higher private equity revenue as well as a $13 million positive Visa derivative fair value adjustment in the third quarter compared to a negative adjustment of $16 million in the second quarter. Turning to Slide 9. Our third quarter expenses continue to be well managed and were up 1% linked quarter. The growth reflected increased personnel expense to support business growth as well as one additional day in the quarter. As we previously stated, we have a goal to reduce costs by $300 million in 2022 through our continuous improvement program. We're now nine months into the year, and we've completed actions related to capturing more than 80% of our annual goal. And as a result, we remain confident we will achieve our full year objectives. As you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 10. And non-performing loans of $2.1 billion increased $22 million or 1% compared to June 30 and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies were $1.6 billion on September 30 at $115 million or 8% increase linked quarter. The increase was driven by elevated levels of administrative delinquencies, the majority of which have already been or are in the process of being resolved. Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $119 million, an increase of $36 million linked quarter, primarily driven by higher commercial loan net charge-offs. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans continues to be historically low at 15 basis points. Provision for the third quarter was $241 million compared to $36 million in the second quarter. The increase reflected slightly weaker economic expectations, which impacted our macroeconomic scenarios and weightings. And during the third quarter, our allowance for credit losses remained essentially stable. Our reserves now totals $5.3 billion and continued to be 1.7% of total loans. In summary, PNC reported a strong third quarter. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we expect moderate growth in the fourth quarter, resulting in 1.8% GDP growth for the full year 2022. We also expect the Fed to raise rates by an additional 125 basis points in the fourth quarter with a 75 basis point increase in November and a 50 basis point increase in December. Looking at the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2022, we expect average loan balances to increase approximately 1%. Net interest income to be up 6% to 8%, fee income to be stable to down 1%; other non-interest income to be between $200 million and $250 million, excluding net securities and Visa activity. Taking our guidance for all components of revenue into consideration, we expect total revenue to increase approximately 2%. We expect total non-interest expense to be stable to up 1%. Fourth quarter net charge-offs to be between $125 million and $175 million, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18.5%. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions. John, it's Rob. Yes, so on deposits, we saw a decline in the quarter, less so on a spot basis. Actually, commercial deposits grew there at the end of the quarter, but down quarter-over-quarter. When we look forward to the next quarter, we sort of see stable to down. On the consumer side, we do expect some downward trends just reflecting what we've seen lately, which is largely spend related, somewhat seasonal, but also the inflationary pressures. And then on the commercial side, we're calling it stable. Typically, seasonally, we see commercial increase and so far in the quarter, we have seen increases. But there's a lot of forces working against that with quantitative tightening and everything that's going on. So, we're calling for stable overall, down maybe a little bit. Yes, sure. Sure. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our betas are running right now at around 22%. We expect it to go to 30% by year-end. Well, I think in terms of the margin, we saw a nice increase, obviously, in the third quarter. We won't see that equivalent jump necessarily in the fourth quarter, but as the Fed continues to raise rates, we will continue to see some margin expansion. Yes. So, we have been active re-purchasers of our shares. We've been operating under the stressed capital buffer framework, which allows us a lot of flexibility. We pointed to $700 or $750 as sort of our average purchase rate, which is roughly about what we've done since we reinstated our share repurchases following the acquisition of BBVA. So that's just a rule of thumb. We can do more. We can do less as conditions were. And so going forward, we'll see. We will be purchasers of our shares in the fourth quarter, the amount of which will be determined based on conditions. Well, I mean, I think you said it. I think it's somewhat self-evident. As the Fed continues to raise rates, we will see increases in NII. Obviously, we'll see some higher expenses on the funding part, which gets to the margin. But it will continue to go up as the Fed rates continues to raise rates, at which point they stop doing that, then things will slow down, but that's probably into '23 as we take a look at our forecast. Which is self-evident, yes. Yes, sure. I'd say all of the above other than maybe the TCE, that's not as much of a driver because it's not part of our regulatory capital. Yes. Sure. Want me to go ahead? Yes, on the delinquencies, Gerard, and I mentioned it in my comments, the increase was entirely driven by administrative delinquencies, which have largely been resolved. So delinquencies adjusted for that are essentially flat, maybe even down a little bit. On the non-performers, they are up a little bit. But as you know, we're coming up off of such, such low, low levels that some increase is inevitable and doesn't necessarily reflect a broader move. Yes, that's right. Percentage increases. We'll take that as an off-line item. Yes. That's the answer. That's relative to our expectations the consumers moved more slowly than we would have thought. Or longer. Yes. I mean, well, for the industry, it's all pretty straightforward. You see it there. I would say following -- at the altitude you're asking the question, following the flood of liquidity and deposits in the system, we're going to see those recede. And then in regard to the mix between net interest-bearing and -- or non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing, we'll see that shift. We're already starting to see it on the corporate side, but the bulk of our deposits in terms of the core deposits, it's the same ratio of 33% non-interest-bearing, two-thirds interest-bearing. So on the TLAC and SPOE issue. Yes. Well, Bill, you want to open up and I could add color. Well, just a couple of thoughts. I mean one is, obviously, there's a lot of conversation about it. But at this point, there's no formal proposals or anything to look at. So from our view, it's just observations and speculation. If we observe what's in place with the G-SIBs, our conclusion is it's not necessary for large regional banks, to your point, we thought that came through in the tailoring 95% plus of what we do is within the bank. 99%, well -- that's 95% plus. So again, a simple structure, and it's unclear to us why an SPOE would need to be on top of what's already in place with the FDIC and the deposit insurance fund. So that has us a bit perplexed. No, no. And we operate, as you know, mostly in the higher point of the spectrum in terms of credit quality. So investment grade and prime space and consumer approach is the same. Higher risk, yes, we were never there. Yes. Sure. Well, the decline in the third quarter was more than just the macroeconomic backdrop. It was off of elevated levels of our Harris Williams unit in the second quarter, which were in effect. We did most of our activity in the first half in the second quarter with Harris Williams. So we knew that, we called that, and we put that into our guidance. And then just going forward in terms of our capital markets view, Harris Williams is the biggest component. Their pipeline is very big. The degree to which they do more or less deals remains to be seen. Our view for the broader category is flattish to down and recognizing there could be some upside or downside depending on the macroeconomic factors you talk about. Yes. So I mean your question is just around in terms of the fees. In the Harris Williams line item, our efficiency ratio is probably in the mid-70s, just roughly plus or minus. In regard to the outlook in terms of the fees, we'll see -- obviously, I'll just go through the categories, asset management is probably going to see some headwinds. You can see what's going on in the equity markets, although any given day, who knows, but we'll be under some pressure. Mortgage obviously included in that. Card and cash management will continue to be strong. We have solid fundamentals there, and that's a steady Eddie, which will continue to expand. And then capital markets, I just spoke about. We sort of see it stable. We could outperform if people want to do deals. The pipeline is there, but it's just -- it's a question of whether the next 90 days, it occurs. Thank you."

            "name": "Bill Demchak",
            "content": "Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you've seen, we delivered another strong quarter, generating $1.6 billion of net income or $3.78 per share. The combination of continued growth in our commercial and consumer loan books and higher rates drove net interest income 14% higher and our net interest margin increased 32 basis points. By the way, that's the largest sequential increase in NIM in more than a decade. Non-interest income was also up modestly, reflecting strong private equity performance and a record quarter in loan syndications, partially offset by weaker M&A activity. We remained disciplined on the expense front, resulting in seven percentage points of positive operating leverage. Our credit quality was largely unchanged in the quarter. While we have not seen any meaningful deterioration in credit quality taking place, our provision of $241 million reflects our slightly weaker economic expectations. Our capital levels remain solid, and we returned $1.7 billion of capital to shareholders during the quarter through share repurchases and dividends. We continue to make good progress on our strategic priorities. Our new and acquired markets performed particularly well across all lines of business, and we see significant untapped opportunities across these markets. We also continue to invest in our payments capabilities to provide differentiated value. We recently acquired Linga, enhancing our capabilities to better serve restaurant and retail clients, particularly in the small business space. And during the quarter, we made enhancements across our retail platform to drive customer convenience and retention. For example, we recently announced a partnership with Allpoint to give our customers surcharge-free access to 41,000 additional ATMs from coast to coast. With this partnership, PNC now offers customers surcharge-free access to more than 60,000 PNC and partner ATMs across the country. In AMG we saw positive quarterly flows of $4 billion, driven by both the private bank and institutional asset management. We are recruiting top talent and remain focused on taking share in all of our markets. In summary, in the third quarter, we executed well as a national Main Street bank, and we are in a position of strength as we look to the future. As always, I want to thank our employees for their hard work in the third quarter and for everything they do to deliver for our customers, communities and our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob to provide more detail about our financial results. It's going to be a bit of a mechanical exercise. So if you assume the Fed is done, if you look at past cycles, you'll see banks continue to increase rates as deposits get scarce. So, there's a little bit of beta creation. Offsetting that, more than offsetting that in our case, because our -- the short-dated nature of our securities book is the roll down of the securities that mature and then get redeployed it to then higher yields, right? So, it will be that fight against where the deposit prices go once the Fed stops versus the roll down of the book and the re-price of the yields on the book. Yes. Just a general comment. Our exposure to REIT has grown as some of the capital markets opportunities have declined. But some REITs are risky and some aren't depending on what their underlying property types are. And we price for risk and decline risk when it's the right thing to do. It also jumps around. There is no trend in there. It's one shows up, one goes away, and it's off such a small number. It's hard to look at. This changes quarter-to-quarter. You have a lot embedded in that question. So start with the swaps. You will have seen, what's the number of $4 billion, $5 billion, we dropped this quarter? If you look at our overall exposure to rates, we're basically -- we're flat to even more asset sensitive to where we were six months ago. Purposely not wanting to invest into this market, so we've let stuff rolled down and kind of replace what's rolled off but not added. Our book today, I guess, our bond book has a duration of 4.6 years, swap book's, 2.5 or 6.2.3. So it all rolls down really fast. And it's rolling down off of yields that have one handles on them that get replaced today at 4.5 plus, assuming everything stops right here. So there's a big opportunity set in the re-pricing of that book and then there's an opportunity set and simply adding duration when it's the right time to do that. I don't think it's the right time to do that yet. Yes. I mean the duration of the swap books 2.3 years, Rob saying, so it's all bullet maturity. So I'm guessing you're going to see a 30-year. Yes. So, we are today much more exposed to down rates than we are to operate. We make lots of money when rates go up or even if they stay just where they are here. We're underinvested, we're asset sensitive. The pieces of that you shouldn't get too hung up on. The exposure we have has fairly short maturities, both on the swap side and on the bond side. And so simply staying where we are gives us the opportunity to reinvest what matures at higher yields, whether that's swaps rolling off or bonds rolling off, and we're going to do that. We will also, at some point, add to get rid of some of the asset sensitivity. We're just not doing that yet. Yes. I've been in a camp for a while in arguments with our economics team. That -- it was going to take a lot higher rates and inflation was going to be exactly what played out. So assuming that what's playing out is what we thought six months ago, you don't buy anything. Was that any harder than that. Yes, I don't know the answer to that, Mike. I mean the consumer money is stickier than everybody. Yes. Corporates are kind of doing what you would otherwise expect depending on their size. Money market yields are doing what you'd otherwise expect, so you have a set of boundaries on competition from money funds have a set of boundaries and competition from high-rate deposit accounts, the online deposit accounts. So it's really just the re-pricing of the core consumer just occurs slower than I think the industry assumed. I would tell you that we're probably getting close, but I continue to think and we've seen a lot of this play out at the back end of the curve is going to sell off here. I mean my base expectation is that it's going to be tough to get inflation down. They even have a two handle on it. But I do think the Fed is going to pause at some point. When they do that, inflation is still sticky and I think you're going to see the curve flatten. So I just -- it's tough to want to lock in term rates at the moment and essentially eat negative carry three months from now. No, you'd go negative in three months based on foresight. So, we need to see some semblance of when and how the Fed is going to stop and whether or not inflation is really move towards two or just kind of gotten down to the low 3s and sticks there, which is what I'm afraid might happen. You have to -- I mean, at some point in time, you would expect that to occur. That's a function of where you think liquidity is going to go from the deposit side, but I don't know what time line that would otherwise follow. 99%. I'm not sure what you're referring to about construction. But broadly, we haven't seen any change in our credit book. I mean, we're seeing balances increase in credit card, which is a good thing. So people are finally drawing down on credit. But we really haven't seen deterioration in the performance of the book across anything. In terms of what we lend to, we just don't -- we don't change our credit box. We have a set of criteria that we lend to will change price and certain asset classes, prices are going up or in certain classes. Auto is an example where spreads are just too tight relative to where we want to lend. I can't think of any other examples where... But if it's real estate construction, we've been active in the multifamily side. If you're looking at sort of smaller real estate... We were never in that business to begin with. Yes. That's kind of a smaller bank activity. Yes. Inside of that space, we actually had a record quarter in loan syndications. And we had a record quarter in middle market loan originations, which is related to that. So there's actually a lot of activity, particularly as the bond markets are drying up that benefits us. Harris Williams just was a big number in the second quarter. So when you're going off of that base, it's not as if the core underlying business, ex-Harris Williams is strong and it's actually doing quite well. And the M&A market at the moment is tough."

Participating on this call are PNC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Roley, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These materials are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of July 15, 2022, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Demchak: Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you've seen, we had a strong second quarter, highlighted by 9% revenue growth and solid positive operating leverage resulting in PPNR growth of 23%. We maintained strong credit quality and fees rebounded from the first quarter, driven primarily by capital markets activity, including Harris Williams, and continued growth in card and cash management. The strong loan growth and rising rates helped us to increase both net interest income and net interest margin meaningfully. Loan growth was driven by C&I, where new production increased significantly and utilization returned to near pre-pandemic levels. Consumer loans also grew, driven by mortgage and home equity. Higher rates continued to adversely impact the unrealized value of our securities book. In response, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve continued to reposition the portfolio during the quarter, resulting in 60% of our securities portfolio now being held and held to maturity. We returned $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders during the quarter through share repurchases and dividends. Looking forward, there is uncertainty in the environment we're operating and including the impact of higher rates, supply chain disruptions and inflation. But regardless of the path ahead macroeconomically, we believe having a strong balance sheet, a solid mix of fee-based businesses, continued focus on expense management and differentiated strategies for organic growth will continue to provide the foundation for our success. And our focus is on executing the things we can control and not getting distracted by what is beyond our control. Along those lines, we delivered well on our strategic priorities in the quarter, including the build-out of our new BBVA and expansion markets, modernizing our retail banking technology platform, bolstering our asset management offering and building differentiated and responsible capabilities for our retail and commercial customers in the payment space. As I've talked about recently at conferences, our performance in the BBVA markets has exceeded our own expectations. On Slide 3, you can see the strong growth we've generated in these markets across customer segments. In corporate banking, we've seen sales increase 40% linked quarter and maintained a 50% noncredit mix of sales since conversion. We've seen similar growth within commercial banking, where sales in the BBVA USA markets are up 32% linked quarter and noncredit sales to total sales have been approximately 55% since conversion. In retail banking, we've experienced a notable increase in sales for both small businesses and consumers of 16% and 22%, respectively. And we continue to invest in AMG, and a big part of that is building a strong customer-focused team that can deliver our brand across our footprint. We have built good momentum in our recruiting efforts over the past few quarters, hiring advisers across all areas of the business to help deliver for our clients. I'll close by thanking our employees for their hard work and dedication to our customers and communities. Moving forward, we believe that we're well positioned to continue to grow shareholder value. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our results, and then we'll take your questions.\nRob Reilly: Well, thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4, and is presented on an average basis. During the quarter, loan balances averaged $305 billion, an increase of $14 billion or 5%. Investment securities grew approximately $1 billion or 1%. And our average cash balances at the Federal Reserve declined $23 billion. Deposit balances averaged $447 billion, a decline of $7 billion or 2%. Our tangible book value was $74.39 per common share as of June 30, a 7% decline linked quarter, entirely AOCI driven as a function of higher rates. And as of June 30, 2022, our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 9.6%. Given our strong capital ratios, we continue to be well positioned with significant capital flexibility. During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders through $627 million of common dividends and $737 million of share repurchases for 4.3 million shares. Our recent CCAR results underscore the strength of our balance sheet and support our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. As you know, our stress capital buffer for the fourth quarter period beginning in October 2022, is now 2.9%, and our applicable ratios are comfortably in excess of the regulatory minimums. Earlier this year, our Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase framework, which allows for up to 100 million common shares, of which approximately 59% were still available for repurchase as of June 30. This allows for the continuation of our recent average share repurchase levels in dollars as well as the flexibility to increase those levels should conditions warrant. Slide 5 shows our loans in more detail. During the second quarter, we delivered solid loan growth across our expanded franchise, particularly when compared to 2021 growth rates. 2021, as you know, was characterized by low utilization levels, PPP loan forgiveness, and in PNC's case, a repositioning of certain acquisition-related portfolios. Loan balances averaged $305 billion, an increase of $14 billion or 5% compared to the first quarter, reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans. Commercial loans, excluding PPP, grew $13 billion, driven by higher new production as well as utilization. Included in this growth was approximately $5 billion related to high-quality short-term loans that are expected to mature during the second half of the year. Notably, in our C&IB segment, the utilization rate increased more than 120 basis points, and our overall commitments were 5% higher compared to the first quarter. PPP loan balances declined $1.2 billion, and at the end of the quarter were less than $1 billion. Consumer loans increased $2 billion as higher mortgage and home equity balances were partially offset by lower auto loans. And loan yields increased 10 basis points compared to the first quarter, driven by higher interest rates. Slide 6 highlights the composition of our deposit portfolio as well as the average balance changes linked quarter. We have a strong core deposit base, which is 2/3 interest-bearing and 1/3 noninterest-bearing. Within interest-bearing, 70% are consumer, and within noninterest-bearing, 50% are commercial compensating balances and represent stable operating deposits. At the end of the second quarter, our loan-to-deposit ratio was 71%, which remains well below our pre-pandemic historic average. On the right, you can see linked quarter change in deposits in more detail. Deposits averaged $447 billion in the second quarter, a decline of nearly $7 billion or 2% linked quarter. Commercial deposits declined $8 billion or 4%, primarily in noninterest-bearing deposits due to movement to higher yielding investments and seasonality. Average consumer deposits increased seasonally by $2 billion or 1%. Overall, our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased 8 basis points linked quarter to 12 basis points. Deposit betas have lagged early in the rate rising cycle, but we expect our deposit betas to accelerate in the third quarter and throughout the remainder of the year given our increased rate forecast. And as a result, we now expect our betas to approach 30% by year-end, compared to our previous expectation of 22%. Slide 7 details our securities portfolio. On an average basis, our securities grew $800 million or 1% during the quarter, representing a slower pace of reinvestment in light of the rapidly rising interest rate environment. The yield on our securities portfolio increased 25 basis points to 1.89%, driven by higher reinvestment yields as well as lower premium amortization. On a spot basis, our securities remained relatively stable during the second quarter as net purchases were largely offset by net unrealized losses on the portfolio. As Bill mentioned, in total, we now have 60% of our securities and held to maturity as of June 30, which will help mitigate future AOCI impacts from rising interest rates. Net pretax unrealized losses on the securities portfolio totaled $8.3 billion at the end of the second quarter. This includes $5.4 billion related to securities transferred to held to maturity, which will accrete back over the remaining lives of those securities. Turning to the income statement on Slide 8. As you can see, second quarter 2022 reported net income was $1.5 billion, or $3.39 per share, which included pretax integration costs of $14 million. Excluding integration costs, adjusted EPS was $3.42. Revenue was up $424 million or 9% compared with the first quarter. Expenses increased $72 million or 2%, resulting in 7% positive operating leverage linked quarter. Provision was $36 million and our effective tax rate was 18.5%. Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Slide 9 details our revenue trends. Total revenue for the second quarter of $5.1 billion increased 9% or $424 million linked quarter. Net interest income of $3.1 billion was up $247 million or 9%. The benefit of higher yields on interest-earning assets and increased loan balances was partially offset by higher funding costs. And as a result, net interest margin increased 22 basis points to 2.5%. Second quarter fee income was $1.9 billion, an increase of $211 million or 13% linked quarter. Looking at the detail of each category. Asset management and brokerage fees decreased $12 million or 3%, reflecting lower average equity markets. Capital market-related fees rebounded as expected and increased $157 million or 62%, driven by higher M&A advisory seats. Card and cash management revenue grew $51 million or 8%, driven by higher consumer spending activity and increased treasury management product revenue. Lending and deposit services increased $13 million or 5%, reflecting seasonally higher activity and included lower integration-related fee waivers. Residential and commercial mortgage noninterest income was essentially stable linked quarter, with higher revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities offset lower residential mortgage loan sales revenue. Finally, other noninterest income declined $34 million and included a $16 million Visa negative fair value adjustment related to litigation escrow funding and derivative valuation changes. Turning to Slide 10. Our second quarter expenses were up by $72 million or 2% linked quarter, driven by increased business activity, merit increases and higher marketing spend. These increases were partially offset by seasonally lower occupancy expense and lower other expense. We remain deliberate around our expense management. And as we've previously stated, we have a goal to reduce costs by $300 million in 2022 through our continuous improvement program, and we're confident we'll achieve our full year target. As you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 11. Overall, we saw broad improvements across all categories. Nonperforming loans of $2 billion decreased $252 million or 11% compared to March 31, and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies were $1.5 billion on June 30, a $188 million decline linked quarter, reflecting lower consumer and commercial loan delinquencies, which included the resolution of acquisition-related administrative and operational delays. Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $83 million, a decrease of $54 million linked quarter, driven by lower consumer net charge-offs, primarily within the auto portfolio. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans continues to be historically low at 11 basis points. And during the second quarter, our allowance for credit losses remained essentially stable, and our reserves now total $5.1 billion or 1.7% of total loans. In summary, PNC reported a solid second quarter, and we're well positioned for the second half of 2022 as we continue to realize the potential of our coast-to-coast franchise. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we expect the pace of economic growth to slow over the remainder of 2022, resulting in 2% average annual real GDP growth. We also expect the Fed to raise rates by an additional cumulative 175 basis points through the remainder of this year to a range of 3.25% to 3.5% by year-end. Looking at the third quarter of 2022, compared to the second quarter of 2022, we expect average loan balances to be up 1% to 2%. We expect net interest income to be up 10% to 12%. We expect noninterest income to be down 3% to 5%, which results in total revenue increasing 4% to 6%. We expect total noninterest expense to be stable to up 1%. And we expect third quarter net charge-offs to be between $125 million and $175 million. Considering our reported operating results for the first half of 2022, third quarter expectations, and current economic forecast for the full year 2022 compared to the full year 2021, we expect average loan growth of approximately 13% by an 8% loan growth on a spot basis. We expect total revenue growth to be 9% to 11%. Our revenue outlook for the full year is unchanged from the guidance we provided in April. However, relative to our expectations at that time, we now expect more net interest income from higher rates, offset by somewhat lower fees. We expect expenses, excluding integration expense to be up 4% to 6%. And we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.\nOperator:  And our first question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Rob, can you elaborate a little further on the deposit beta change? Is it purely just the rate of Or is there a deposit mix that's also influencing your new outlook for the beta?\nRob Reilly: Yes, probably both, but a little bit more of the former. We're just at that point now where we're seeing rates rising to the point where the betas are becoming active. They were not that active on the consumer side, a little bit on the commercial side in the first quarter, and that's picked up a bit. More on the commercial side as we expected, and in our case, it's our nonoperating deposits that explains the decline there in the second quarter. So betas are beginning to move. We expected that, and we're ready for it.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. Credit quality, obviously, was quite strong for you folks, similar to the prior quarter. And Bill, I don't know -- I know there's a lot of uncertainty out there with what's going on in the world, but it just seems, for your company at least, you are so well positioned from a credit quality standpoint. And is it -- are we just going to go off a cliff or something at the end of the year with some sort of big recession that has frightened everybody about credit quality for banks in general? Any elaboration on your outlook on credit and the outlook for the economy?\nBill Demchak: Yes. Look, I don't think there's any cliff involved. I do think that the trouble ahead lies somewhere in the middle of next year not any time in the next 6 months. But what you're seeing inside of our credit book, you got to remember that during this period of time, we continue to kind of run off a higher risk book from BBVA, and our loan growth is largely in higher quality names. So the overall quality of our book actually improves quarter-on-quarter. Eventually, that has to stop. And eventually, I think the Fed has to slow the economy to a pace to get inflation under control, and I think that's going to be harder to do than the market currently assumes, and I think it's going to take longer than the market currently assumes. And when that happens, we're going to see credit costs go up at least back to what we would call normalized levels. But I don't think -- I don't see any particular bubbles inside of the banking system as it relates to credit. I think you're just going to see a slow grind with credit losses increasing over time as we get into the slowdown.\nRob Reilly: And some normalization.\nGerard Cassidy: I'm sorry, what was that Rob, I'm sorry.\nRob Reilly: Saying just -- and Bill mentioned it, Gerard, just some normalization, which is inevitable.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.\nBill Carcache: There was a time where you talked about increasing the mix of your securities given all the liquidity in the system. But as the Fed engages in QT, and with the strong loan growth that you're seeing, could we see you go the other way and perhaps redeploy some of your securities portfolio paydowns to fund more of your growth such that you actually remix more -- a larger mix of your earning assets towards loans?\nBill Demchak: I think, over time that is probably likely if we continue to see loan growth we do. But you shouldn't mix security balances with the way we think about fixed rate exposure hedging our deposits, right? Securities are one way we do that, swaps are another way, and then, of course, our fixed rate assets themselves. And then inside of that, the duration of the securities we buy. So long story short, the balance is probably decline, but we're sitting in a period of time right now where we're very asset sensitive. You'll notice our balances basically stayed flat through the course of the quarter as we kind of purposely watch and let things roll off here given our view on what we think longer term rates are going to ultimately do. So balances could go down just as a matter of sort of algebra in the balance sheet, but our ability to invest in rising rates is still there in a large way.\nRob Reilly: Yes, that's right. Well, the context -- Bill, as you know, the context of your question is historically pre sort of the rapid increase in liquidity over the last couple of years, we did run about 20% of our securities to our earning assets. We raised that because of all the liquidity in the system. So we're still pretty high on a historical basis, but it's still -- Demchak just said, that's not likely to change anytime soon.\nBill Carcache: That's very helpful. And separately, as the Fed proceeds through the hiking cycle at some point, I think as you've both alluded to in your comments, that's going to presumably slow the pace of growth. But taking your loan growth guidance higher for the year, maybe could you speak to how much of that improved outlook is idiosyncratic because it certainly does sound like that you're expecting a deceleration at some point at the macro level.\nBill Demchak: A lot of it just comes from our ability to win new business. Utilization rates have largely approached where we were, I think, Rob, pre pandemic at this point.\nRob Reilly: Yes.\nBill Demchak: So there's a little bit of room there. But these new markets and our -- just our ability to win new business. And by the way, new business that is 50% fee-based is pretty strong. And we feel confident we'll be able to continue to do that independent of what happens in the economy.\nRob Reilly: Yes. And I would just add to that. In terms of the loan growth outlook for the 12 months, we're up a bit, mostly because of the outperformance in the first half relative to our expectations. So that's sort of truing up, so to speak.\nBill Carcache: Got it. And if I could squeeze in one last one. I think it's interesting, Bill, to think about your commentary around the normalization of credit as the Fed proceeds through its hiking cycle. And sort of we think about the long and variable lags that between monetary policy and when that ultimately starts to show up in credit, and then when you sort of juxtapose that with what's happening with reserve rates, which it's notable that for most of your peers, they've drifted below their day 1 levels. And I know, for you guys, there's a BBVA deal and lots of other moving parts, but that  seems relatively conservative. How are you thinking about the trajectory of that from here in the context of the thought process you just laid out of the Fed hiking cycle eventually leading to credit normalization probably as we get into maybe the middle of next year or somewhere in that time frame?\nBill Demchak: That's an impossible question to answer given the dynamics of CECL. But you should assume -- we assume that, all else equal, credit quality is going to deteriorate at some pace from here through the next 2 years. I just don't think it's going to be all that dramatic. And it almost has to be a true statement given the charge-off levels that we've been seeing.\nRob Reilly: Right. And I would add to that, our reserve levels are above our day 1 fee so even adjusted for the BBVA acquisition, we're appropriately reserved. Now -- and feel good about it.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: Just wanted to just ask to dissect a little bit. Rob, you mentioned that your outlook for NII is a little bit better. Your outlook for fees are a little softer. The NII one, I think we get, just wondering if you can help us understand now what kind of curve you're building in? And is it more just that uptick of rates that offsets that new 30% beta outcome?\nRob Reilly: Yes, that's right, Ken. Yes, that's exactly right. So higher rate environment, NII and the balances that we've generated contribute to the improved NII look. And then you sort of referenced it in terms of the fees, mostly in terms of our full year expectations compared to what we thought at the beginning of the year and last quarter, some softer on AMG and mortgage, as you would expect, with the equity markets performing like they are for AMG and interest rates on the mortgage side. So it's sort of a -- the trade-off of the higher rates.\nKen Usdin: Got it, right. Sorry, I missed your 3.25%, 3.50% comment from earlier. So thank you. And then just on the fee side then, you had a really good bounce back as you expected, especially in the capital market. So what's your -- what's changed there in terms of what you're seeing as far as the outlook on the fee side?\nRob Reilly: So on the fee side, again, for the full year, most of the change relative to our full year expectations is within AMG and mortgage. On capital markets, you'll recall, we had a soft first quarter relative to our expectations. We did see the bounce back in the second quarter. So we're back in position with our full year expectations in the second half, obviously remains to be seen.\nKen Usdin: Okay. And if I could just sneak one more in. You mentioned -- Bill, you mentioned all the different ways that you can get exposure to variable rates and such. I'm just wondering, how are you guys thinking about just swaps portfolio, you had done some adds in terms of protecting and managing the near-term upside versus the potential of what happens down the road based on Fed funds, Futures curve expectations and your general view of the economy.\nBill Demchak: We don't think about the swaps book separate from our basic investing and fixed rate exposure. Where we sit across the securities book and swaps and everything we do fixed rate, we're looking at a curve now where I kind of think the year-end rates, in my own mind, are probably largely right, but I think there's a -- I think the assumption that the Fed is going to start easing in the spring of next year is absurd, which means we're holding off at this point because we think there's going to be -- there's still value to be had in the longer end of the curve as people come to the realization that inflation isn't as easy to tame as people might assume. And separately that the Fed isn't going to immediately cut simply because the economy slows if inflation is still running high. So we're going to sit pat, but not -- we don't think swaps are one thing in bonds or another. We just -- we look at our interest rate exposure. We're very asset sensitive. We have an opportunity to deploy in multiple places. We're just not doing it. We basically let everything run down thus far this year.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS.\nErika Najarian: I'm sure if this is the question I can ask, but I just wanted to clarify the loan growth expectation rose, the performance has been spectacular, the revenues didn't move even though we had the higher loan growth and the higher rate outlook, and that's because of the higher beta assumed and also lower fees, Rob?\nRob Reilly: Well, in part. I think the earlier question you might have missed it, Erika, was the improved outlook for the full year loan growth. The answer was most of that was a true-up to our outperformance in the first half. So we grew loans faster than we thought we would in the first 6 months, which is great. So we true-up that full year expectation. So all of that is built in to the full year guidance.\nBill Demchak: Part of the impact that we're seeing in NII and NIM is actually on our loan yields, where the quality of our book is it improves fairly substantially. We've put a lot of very high-grade stuff on. And spreads have actually come in quarter-on-quarter. So when we look at the out forecast on NII, together with loan growth, which will be pretty healthy, we have in there -- embedded in there this notion that spreads are tighter than they were as we basically improve the quality of the book.\nRob Reilly: That's another component. That's right.\nBill Demchak: Yes.\nErika Najarian: Got it. And just as a follow-up question. How should we think about deposit growth from here? Bill, I think you've been the one that has been vocal about the notion that if loan growth is positive, deposit growth should be positive. How should we weigh that relative to probably your willful desire to work out the nonoperating deposits out of your balance sheet and QT.\nBill Demchak: Yes. Well, it's a good question, and the answer remains to be seen a little bit. We've clearly seen the larger corporates move liquidity out of the banking system into money markets, government money markets. And I think, as we go forward, the combination of QT from the Fed and what they do with their repo facility is going to drive some of the yield available in those funds, which in turn is going to drive how much of that sits on bank's balance sheets or not. Outside of those deposits, it's more about a rate paid game. And I think deposits kind of inside of the retail space and the smaller mid-market commercial space, I think deposits actually grow simply because of the loan volume. But the mix shift that we've seen in commercial from a little bit less noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing, that game is going to play out. So thus far, I mean, if you look at total liquidity in the system, it really hasn't moved. And of course, the Fed hasn't really started their QT program yet. What we've seen is a movement of liquidity from banks into money funds as money fund yields started to grow. So this is going to take a while to play out.\nRob Reilly: Yes. And our expectations, Erika, are generally stable, but Bill pointed the mix could be different. And then an open question on the nonoperational deposits, which we'll either do or not do.\nBill Demchak: Yes. A big part of what we've seen go thus far are kind of deposits that we don't really care about. They were -- we kind of call them surge deposits internally, which were noncore clients' parking liquidity that now have kind of gone into funds.\nRob Reilly: And importantly, are, by definition low margin.\nBill Demchak: Yes.\nErika Najarian: Got it. And my last question, Bill, you said earlier you don't really see any bubbles within the banking system. I think a lot of investors are more concerned about what's outside of the banking system. And interestingly, I'm sure you know this statistic very well. Corporate lending in terms of the bank share of it has declined to 16%. I guess my question to you is, do you see an opportunity as rates rise and the economy slows down, is some of that market share available back to banks in terms of what's happened in the private market? Or was that never credit that you wanted to do anyway? And don't you have a unit within P&C that does third-party recoveries in terms of if you have corporate defaults, you could be a third-party recoverer if that's the term.\nBill Demchak: Yes. Well, first, I want to see the audit on only 16% of corporate credit being inside of banks, but I'm sure there's some way you can get that right.\nRob Reilly: Yes.\nBill Demchak: No, we -- its credit outside of the banking system melts. We play in that in 2 ways. One is, if it's in the real estate space, we do that inside of our special servicing arm in Midland. Two is we are very good at working corporate credits, and we wouldn't be afraid of buying portfolios of troubled assets. And three, and I think this is what you're referring to is in our asset-based lending group, we play the role of senior lender on a very secured basis for -- and basically the agent for the entire capital structure. And as pieces below us struggle, the fee opportunity for us to work those loans out on behalf of the B lenders is quite high. Furthermore, we continue to be approached by multiple B lenders to basically run their books as they look at what's coming their way. Thus far, we haven't agreed to do any of that. And were we to do it, I think it'd be quite lucrative.\nRob Reilly: And we've done that in the past.\nBill Demchak: Yes.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Mayo: Can you hear me?\nBill Demchak: Yes.\nMichael Mayo: Okay. Great. I guess all these questions get down to NIM. So are you forecasting deposits to run off for the year because you've mentioned betas are starting to move. And I missed the updated guidance because you're guiding for good NII growth. So how much deposit runoff are you assuming in your deposit growth?\nRob Reilly: I can jump on that, and we covered some of that, Mike. Generally speaking, and we recognize the fluidity. For the second half, we're calling for stable deposits, some mix change between noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing also an open question in terms of nonoperational deposits and what betas are required for that and whether we choose to keep those or not. So that all remains to be seen. But the outlook is stable. And NIM, we do expect to expand.\nMichael Mayo: And you talked about tighter loan yield spreads just because you're going up in quality. Are you getting rewarded for this more uncertain outlook? I mean, capital markets, some assets are pricing at near recession levels, but I feel like the lending markets are not doing the same. And are you getting more spread for the added chance of a recession?\nBill Demchak: It depends on the lending sector. So we are, for example, an asset-based -- straight spreads on high rated stuff has kind of stabilized. A lot of what we're seeing is just a mix shift in the quality of our book, not a change in the market in terms of spread where I think the market continues to be irrational is on the consumer side. So auto lending seems, in our view, to be a little bit of a bubble, and some of the things we're still seeing being done on the consumer side. But on the corporate side, on the real estate side, the shift is moving back towards the banks in terms of our ability to negotiate and get spread and get covenants and get structure. Just not a dramatic shift the way you've seen in some of the headline stuff on capital markets related issues.\nMichael Mayo: So you're getting some of that. Bill, can you put this in context, this looks like the fastest commercial loan growth in 14 years. And we haven't had a cycle like this in quite some time. And I guess, I'm repeating, I think what you've said in the past. It's inventory, it's credit utilization, it's capital expenditures, it's working capital, some business from capital markets back to the banks. Did I miss anything there?\nBill Demchak: No. I mean it's -- thank you for reminding. I mean that's what happened, right? We've had inventory build and CapEx and a little volume back to the banks and boom, you get big loan growth.\nRob Reilly: Yes, in particular, and it overlaps, Mike, particularly on the utilization, which has grown.\nBill Demchak: Yes. But that's coming off of their inventory, Bill, which overlaps.\nMichael Mayo: The one I didn't mention that some other banks have mentioned, you did not. So I don't want to leave the witness here, but in terms of gaining share from nonbanks, because you're seeing some nonbank entities not on a solid footing as they were in the past. Are you gaining share from them? Do you expect to gain share from them? Are there opportunities to do so? Are you shifting resources because I get it, you're the national main street bank, you're in 30 MSAs. You have a lot on your plate to try to gain share in all those markets. Meanwhile, you have some verticals where you might be able to gain share. What are you doing to try to capitalize on that?\nBill Demchak: Yes. Mike, most of those players play in a risk bucket that we don't like to play in, right? So the exception to that is, in our asset-based lending book, where borrowers who might have been able to do a cash flow loan with a BDC at one point are now going to come back to the banks and do it asset-based. But on the consumer side, the guys who are out there playing subprime consumer or even in the leverage lending side, cash flow unsecured, we just don't have a big book of business there, nor do we want one.\nMichael Mayo: Okay. And my last one, just on CECL. You didn't -- I mean you beat on credit. Your credit is great. You've always been high quality. You proved it through the global financial crisis. We get it. But with all this talk about a recession out there, doesn't that give you cover to go ahead and increase reserves. Like, I get it you're above day 1 CECL, but why not just take more reserves out of conservatism?\nBill Demchak: It's -- we have a model and we run by a model. So we're not allowed to just --\nRob Reilly: That's right.\nBill Demchak: As much as I'd like to sometimes put my thumb on the scale. We're not --\nRob Reilly: We don't do that. We don't do that. CECL is a model-driven approach. And as you pointed out, Mike, we're above our day 1. We're appropriately reserved relative to our book.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.\nJohn Pancari: On the -- back to the commercial loan growth topic, I'm sorry if I missed the detail on it, but I know you mentioned the $5 billion in high-quality, short-term loans that were brought on that you expect to mature in the second half. Can you give a little bit of color on that -- on those balances and what drove it? And maybe a little bit in terms of outlook, could you see additional flows in that type of lending as well?\nBill Demchak: We'd like to see additional flows in that type of lending.\nRob Reilly: Sure.\nBill Demchak: It's kind of -- that was client -- a handful of clients, but client-specific timing issues that we were able to serve client needs and their big balances, and they're going to run off.\nRob Reilly: And we'd like to do that.\nBill Demchak: Yes. That happens again, that's great. But these were specific ones we called out both because of their size and also because there are lower spreads in the rest of the book and that had some impact on the loan yield this quarter.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. And then also related to that, in what areas do you expect that you could see some moderation in commercial loan demand as we do get some slowing in economic activity if the Fed succeeds here with the tightening?\nBill Demchak: Eventually, what you're going to see, we've seen utilizations go up as people have built inventories. Now that will reverse itself as we get into a slowdown and people struggle to move inventories, it will peak and then they'll grind it to a halt. But I think that's going to end up being the driver. We'll continue to go work and gain share. And ultimately, against the money we put out, we look at what happens to utilization and utilization will start to drop through a slowdown, peak early into it and then slow down as they try to free up working capital.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. Got it. And then back to the most reserve front. I hear you again in terms of the adequacy of your reserve. In your scenarios, do your economic scenarios that you run that support CECL, did they get worse at all versus last quarter? Or did they -- like how did that change? And then separately, did you have any reallocations within the reserve that were noteworthy, like coming from commercial going into consumer. Can you maybe talk about that? So just trying to get a better feel of your confidence --.\nBill Demchak: Without getting into the details of CECL, I would tell you that we -- within our overall provision, we added 2 reserves as a function of the scenarios we run.\nRob Reilly: Yes. I mean, it's pretty stable, John. So no big mix changes, no big dollar changes. The percentage came down a little bit just because of largely the high credit quality, large underwritings we just spoke about improving the mix. So pretty much unchanged.\nBill Demchak: Well, no, so to clarify that. In terms of the dollar amounts and the stable. But inside of that, obviously, our scenarios built in some worsening concepts. But there's QFR as part of that process that offset that. So end of the day, stable.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess just 1 follow-up, Rob. In terms of as we think about the outlook for deposit betas and margins, if the Fed stops at the end of the year, you talked about the deposit beta and deposit growth expectation in the back half. But give us a sense of the asset sensitivity profile of the balance sheet in a world where the Fed stops hiking, the 2.10 remains inverted for 6 to 12 months. And as Bill alluded to, we may not get cuts as quickly. In that backdrop, do you still expect the margin to drift higher? Or do we start seeing some liability sensitivity where deposits are repricing higher, but you're not seeing the benefit on the asset side?\nRob Reilly: Yes, yes. We don't give explicit NIM outlook. But I would say your question is when does NIM peak. We see NIMs continuing to expand and peaking in '23. So with everything that you described we still see upside in them.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. So safe to assume that even in a backdrop where the Fed stops hiking the NIM should still at least drift higher a bit for a few more quarters. So point noted.\nRob Reilly: Yes, possibly. And again, we're in sort of that context, we're talking about '23 then. 2023.\nEbrahim Poonawala: '23, Yes. And I didn't mean to pin you down or ask for 2023 guidance. I'm just trying to conceptually think if we go into this period where we've not been where the curve remains flat to inverted for a while, what that does to the NIM and it's not unique to you, but I appreciate the color.\nRob Reilly: That's right. That's right.\nBill Demchak: Yes, you have to. The number of pieces that are moving inside of that, even if let's assume they get out there and they just freeze and you have a small inversion in the curve and you sit there, in that instance, betas probably don't move from wherever they were post the last hike. And instead, what you're going to see is a increase in fixed rate asset yields that basically roll off from very low yields into higher yields. And then the upside to the extent we want to deploy at that point. So you see a gain in yields inside of the security book in a static environment simply because everything that was purchased with 1.5% handles rolls off.\nRob Reilly: Yes. That's right. That's why we're still -- some part -- some ways from the peak.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That's fair. I appreciate the perspective. And on the lending side, just still wanted to follow up on 2 things. One, like, do you have a sense of where customers are in terms of rebuilding inventories like that's been a big driver of growth for the last 2 to 3 quarters. But compared to pre-pandemic, are customer inventories back to those levels? Like how would you frame that? And secondly, I would love to hear your thoughts about just outlook for the commercial real estate market in this backdrop, especially if we get a recession? You've been cautious in the past, so would love to hear your thoughts.\nBill Demchak: The inventory question is all over the place because you have a bunch of customers who have more inventory than they want. And you have others who are still struggling to build inventory to keep up with supply because of continued supply chain disruption. So I don't know that there's a simple answer on inventories. Real estate, with the exception of the slow burn on office, where we just -- we continue to be worried, we continue to see slow deterioration, we think we're really well reserved. But absent that kind of slow burn, the rest of it continues to kind of do okay to improve. And I think that holds even at least on the slowdown that's in the back of my mind. Again, I just don't see some big spike into a really ugly recession. So we have our eye on real estate. We have exposure into the office space that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re reserved against. It's kind of doing what we expected. And beyond that, we're not particularly worried about it.\nRob Reilly: Yes. And, to your point, we're well reserved. And multifamily, which is the biggest component of that, is very strong.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. And just 1 quick one. Sorry if I missed it. Did you talk about the pace of buybacks. How we should think about that in the back half of the year?\nRob Reilly: I did in my opening comments. We're going to continue buying back shares roughly at the average rate of what we've been doing the last couple of quarters.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Connor: As we think about loan loss reserves in, call it, a moderate recession, how high or how much add do you think you have to do? I think, for COVID, it was around $2.5 billion X the day 1 CECL impact. But obviously, there's been a mix shift, the BBVA deal and a lot of factors. But as you guys run your stress tests, what would cumulative reserve bill be for a moderate recession?\nBill Demchak: No way to answer that.\nRob Reilly: I was going to say that, Bill said there was an earlier impossible question. Yes, that 1 might be number two.\nBill Demchak: But, I mean, remember that reserve build in COVID, the scenarios we are running, I don't remember off the top of my head if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the kind of employment to 15%, higher GDP. We're not -- this has nothing to do with that, right? We're going to go into a slowdown and we're going to see an increase in reserves at some point, but they're not even going to be related to the thing we saw when COVID hit  economy down.\nRob Reilly: --recovery.\nBill Demchak: Yes, just in terms of size. So you almost have to take that whole example set and remove it from the framework of how you think about provisions going forward.\nMatt O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Connor: Right. So it seems like you're implying, and we've heard from some others that it should be a lot less. But I guess we'll see.\nBill Demchak: No, no. I can't \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Matt, I mean --\nRob Reilly: Yes, right.\nBill Demchak: Only if you think about what those forecasts were, right? I mean, do you remember, they were unemployment going to --\nRob Reilly: 15% to 20%.\nBill Demchak: 15% Yes. I mean it was I don't think there's anybody out there who thinks we have to cater the economy by that amount to get inflation under control. That was -- look, there could be some world event that causes that, but it's not going to be a function of the Fed raising rates and slowing the economy to get inflation under control.\nMatt O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Connor: Yes, agreed. I mean obviously, that's what the market\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still worried about. And it's just interesting, if you put it relative to capital, even if you did what you did for COVID, it's only 50 basis points of capital. So --\nBill Demchak: Matt, look you're bringing up -- this whole issue is the issue, I think, that investors just have completely wrong about the banking system right now. If you look at the market cap that's been pulled out of the banking system and take your worst case reserve build and charge-offs through some cycle, it's just wildly wrong. Yes. We'll have increased losses, but --\nRob Reilly: Not to that extent.\nBill Demchak: Not to anything close like what we put in during COVID. And more importantly, I think there's a growth opportunity through a mild downturn for us, just given the way we run our business and the business that will come back into the banking systems and out of the capital markets. So I am personally confused about all the concern that sits out there on banking reserves and the coming recession and the impacts on the profitability of banks. It will hurt a little bit, but --\nRob Reilly: To your point, if it's being extrapolated from COVID scenario --\nBill Demchak: It's just -- again, that's a data point that needs removed.\nRob Reilly: Right.\nMatt O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Connor: And then just the flip side got a little over $8 billion of losses in OCI. Obviously, a lot of that comes back over time, the part that's related to the bond book. Just give us a rule of thumb like how much of that accretes back each year if rates stay here on the kind of the medium, longer-term part of the curve?\nBill Demchak: Well, the held-to-maturity accretes back independent this point. And I don't know you guys --\nRob Reilly: We disclosed that, Bryan. It's a couple of hundred million.\nBryan Gill: Yes. You can say that.\nBill Demchak: I mean the way we kind of think about it internally, given how much we moved is we ought to have pulled a par on the held-to-maturity book adding to our capital base at a pace that largely hedges us against further declines in AOCI and the available-for-sale book, depending how much of a spike their rates are versus the rolled up. But we feel pretty good about the mix we have at this point. And obviously, it's not impacting our capital flexibility vis-a-vis the way we look at AOCI in terms -- inside of regulatory capital.\nMatt O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Connor: Yes. And I guess what I was asking is like if we just think over the next few years, right, like all that OCI eventually gets reversed back as the bonds mature, you are saddled with $8 billion of losses like a lot of banks, having a drag. I'm just wondering what's a good rule of thumb? Does that $8 billion come back, kind of maybe $1.5 billion, $2 billion a year or something like that?\nBill Demchak: I mean, let's say we've got a  7 years or something.\nRob Reilly: Well, the short answer is approximately $200 million a quarter, $1 billion a year. So that's the number you're looking for. But that's the right neighborhood.\nBill Demchak: Sorry, that's out of the held to maturity.\nRob Reilly: Held to the maturity. Yes, the held to maturity.\nBill Demchak: We have a separate AOCI loss available for sale.\nRob Reilly: Which is dependent on rates. Right.\nOperator:  And our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Just 1 follow-up on that, on the AFS book. I guess the underlying question is, is the duration roughly the same as the HTM book. I get that rates will move that mark around, but let's say, rates never change. Is it the same duration as HTM?\nRob Reilly: Yes, roughly. Yes, roughly.\nBetsy Graseck: Yes. Yes. Okay. And then just separately, I know there's a lot of questions earlier about deposits, et cetera. And I'm just wondering, your loan-to-deposit ratio, I think, today is around 70%, maybe 71%. And in 4Q '19, it was at 83%. So there's lots of room there in the LDR. I'm wondering how you think about it is -- are you happy to go back to 83% in the near term? Or is there a trajectory or a pace that you're comfortable with?\nBill Demchak: Look, if it's high quality, we'd love to go back to 83%. If it's in our risk box and coupled with client relationships where we have really strong cross-sell, that would be a great outcome.\nRob Reilly: Well, that also relates to the deposit pricing and what we choose to do. So yes, you're right. We have room and flexibility there as we go through these increased betas and a growing loan environment.\nBetsy Graseck: Right. So part of the question is just trying to get a sense as to the pace of LDR increase you kind of control with the deposit pricing?\nRob Reilly: Right.\nBetsy Graseck: So you could let a lot more run off before you start to --\nRob Reilly: Yes. Yes, that's my point. That's the flexibility so we can, and we can view these deposits in terms of whether we want to take for that --\nBill Demchak: No. I don't think. I mean, look, our intention here is to keep deposits and grow deposits if we can without having to be aggressive on rate. It's very simple. And inside of that, we'd like to grow loans. And if we manage to do the 2 things there and grow loan to deposits to 83%, we'll be making  load of money given the fee mix we get when we grow loans.\nRob Reilly: That's a good --\nBill Demchak: That would be a great thing to be able to do, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to work on it.\nBetsy Graseck: Yes. Well, I mean, I guess part of the question is you don't have to be more competitive on deposit rate right now, you could wait a few more quarters and then move.\nRob Reilly: Yes. That's what I said.\nBill Demchak: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Mayo: I wanted to follow up just because, Bill, you're just -- seem so adamant that the market cap that's been taken out of your stock far exceeds credit loss hits that you have in a scenario. So a personal question. You've owned a lot of stock for a long time. You have a lot of skin in the game. At what point would you put more skin in the game and buy some shares? We haven't seen that I think, by any bank CEO. And if you think this is a dislocation and you think it's so unlikely to have some kind of deep recession, global financial crisis, pandemic sort of situation, have you thought about that? I mean, would you do that?\nBill Demchak: I think about it all the time. I don't know when I go into details on my own financial situation, but it's -- I see a lot of value there. It's interesting. We've had a bunch of senior execs actually enroll in our employee stock purchase plan --\nRob Reilly: That's right.\nBill Demchak: Which maybe is a simple way for me to get a few shares here and there. But look, I think there's a lot of value. I don't know that you're going to see me make a giant purchase because, as you said, I own a lot of stock, and it's most of my net worth.\nMichael Mayo: Just an extra tone from the top, but I guess you said it on the call. Just one more time on that question. Again, you have this disconnect between pricing the capital markets with some other areas and your own expectations. So what you're saying before is that the power or the control has gone back to the banks from the borrower in terms of terms and structure, maybe not the same degree of pricing though. And I'm just -- it's that pricing element that -- it's tough for you or anyone to really know how much you should be pricing these loans if you think we might be going into a recession. So how do you get to that level?\nBill Demchak: Look, it's -- I mean pricing ultimately is market-driven. And it's -- I would expect, for a given credit quality, we're going to see small backup. Of course, pricing is also based on a grid. So as we go into a slower economy and people run another turn of leverage given their performance, we'll see jumps in spreads that's built into the existing contract because spreads are performance based on a lot of the loans that we do. So I -- -- we'll get there. More important to us, Mike, is the cross-sell that we ultimately get. At the end loan prices -- as long as we get good structure, pricing is important, but pricing along with the majority of the TM relationship and capital markets business really ups the return that you get from that client relationship.\nRob Reilly: And there's a structure component. There's a lot of good companies out there that don't have structures that we would lend into that they could change that.\nMichael Mayo: And then I guess one more. Just in terms of your 30 MSAs or your newer markets, your BBVA markets, do you have any metrics on what market share you have there versus your legacy franchise? Because that would size the opportunity.\nBill Demchak: It's small. Big opportunity. Opportunity is big.\nRob Reilly: Big opportunity. We don't need to worry about that right now. We just need to do more.\nOperator: There are no further questions.\nBill Demchak: Thanks, everybody.\nRob Reilly: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude the call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you disconnect your lines. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Rob Reilly",
            "content": "Well, thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4, and is presented on an average basis. During the quarter, loan balances averaged $305 billion, an increase of $14 billion or 5%. Investment securities grew approximately $1 billion or 1%. And our average cash balances at the Federal Reserve declined $23 billion. Deposit balances averaged $447 billion, a decline of $7 billion or 2%. Our tangible book value was $74.39 per common share as of June 30, a 7% decline linked quarter, entirely AOCI driven as a function of higher rates. And as of June 30, 2022, our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 9.6%. Given our strong capital ratios, we continue to be well positioned with significant capital flexibility. During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders through $627 million of common dividends and $737 million of share repurchases for 4.3 million shares. Our recent CCAR results underscore the strength of our balance sheet and support our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. As you know, our stress capital buffer for the fourth quarter period beginning in October 2022, is now 2.9%, and our applicable ratios are comfortably in excess of the regulatory minimums. Earlier this year, our Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase framework, which allows for up to 100 million common shares, of which approximately 59% were still available for repurchase as of June 30. This allows for the continuation of our recent average share repurchase levels in dollars as well as the flexibility to increase those levels should conditions warrant. Slide 5 shows our loans in more detail. During the second quarter, we delivered solid loan growth across our expanded franchise, particularly when compared to 2021 growth rates. 2021, as you know, was characterized by low utilization levels, PPP loan forgiveness, and in PNC's case, a repositioning of certain acquisition-related portfolios. Loan balances averaged $305 billion, an increase of $14 billion or 5% compared to the first quarter, reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans. Commercial loans, excluding PPP, grew $13 billion, driven by higher new production as well as utilization. Included in this growth was approximately $5 billion related to high-quality short-term loans that are expected to mature during the second half of the year. Notably, in our C&IB segment, the utilization rate increased more than 120 basis points, and our overall commitments were 5% higher compared to the first quarter. PPP loan balances declined $1.2 billion, and at the end of the quarter were less than $1 billion. Consumer loans increased $2 billion as higher mortgage and home equity balances were partially offset by lower auto loans. And loan yields increased 10 basis points compared to the first quarter, driven by higher interest rates. Slide 6 highlights the composition of our deposit portfolio as well as the average balance changes linked quarter. We have a strong core deposit base, which is 2/3 interest-bearing and 1/3 noninterest-bearing. Within interest-bearing, 70% are consumer, and within noninterest-bearing, 50% are commercial compensating balances and represent stable operating deposits. At the end of the second quarter, our loan-to-deposit ratio was 71%, which remains well below our pre-pandemic historic average. On the right, you can see linked quarter change in deposits in more detail. Deposits averaged $447 billion in the second quarter, a decline of nearly $7 billion or 2% linked quarter. Commercial deposits declined $8 billion or 4%, primarily in noninterest-bearing deposits due to movement to higher yielding investments and seasonality. Average consumer deposits increased seasonally by $2 billion or 1%. Overall, our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased 8 basis points linked quarter to 12 basis points. Deposit betas have lagged early in the rate rising cycle, but we expect our deposit betas to accelerate in the third quarter and throughout the remainder of the year given our increased rate forecast. And as a result, we now expect our betas to approach 30% by year-end, compared to our previous expectation of 22%. Slide 7 details our securities portfolio. On an average basis, our securities grew $800 million or 1% during the quarter, representing a slower pace of reinvestment in light of the rapidly rising interest rate environment. The yield on our securities portfolio increased 25 basis points to 1.89%, driven by higher reinvestment yields as well as lower premium amortization. On a spot basis, our securities remained relatively stable during the second quarter as net purchases were largely offset by net unrealized losses on the portfolio. As Bill mentioned, in total, we now have 60% of our securities and held to maturity as of June 30, which will help mitigate future AOCI impacts from rising interest rates. Net pretax unrealized losses on the securities portfolio totaled $8.3 billion at the end of the second quarter. This includes $5.4 billion related to securities transferred to held to maturity, which will accrete back over the remaining lives of those securities. Turning to the income statement on Slide 8. As you can see, second quarter 2022 reported net income was $1.5 billion, or $3.39 per share, which included pretax integration costs of $14 million. Excluding integration costs, adjusted EPS was $3.42. Revenue was up $424 million or 9% compared with the first quarter. Expenses increased $72 million or 2%, resulting in 7% positive operating leverage linked quarter. Provision was $36 million and our effective tax rate was 18.5%. Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Slide 9 details our revenue trends. Total revenue for the second quarter of $5.1 billion increased 9% or $424 million linked quarter. Net interest income of $3.1 billion was up $247 million or 9%. The benefit of higher yields on interest-earning assets and increased loan balances was partially offset by higher funding costs. And as a result, net interest margin increased 22 basis points to 2.5%. Second quarter fee income was $1.9 billion, an increase of $211 million or 13% linked quarter. Looking at the detail of each category. Asset management and brokerage fees decreased $12 million or 3%, reflecting lower average equity markets. Capital market-related fees rebounded as expected and increased $157 million or 62%, driven by higher M&A advisory seats. Card and cash management revenue grew $51 million or 8%, driven by higher consumer spending activity and increased treasury management product revenue. Lending and deposit services increased $13 million or 5%, reflecting seasonally higher activity and included lower integration-related fee waivers. Residential and commercial mortgage noninterest income was essentially stable linked quarter, with higher revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities offset lower residential mortgage loan sales revenue. Finally, other noninterest income declined $34 million and included a $16 million Visa negative fair value adjustment related to litigation escrow funding and derivative valuation changes. Turning to Slide 10. Our second quarter expenses were up by $72 million or 2% linked quarter, driven by increased business activity, merit increases and higher marketing spend. These increases were partially offset by seasonally lower occupancy expense and lower other expense. We remain deliberate around our expense management. And as we've previously stated, we have a goal to reduce costs by $300 million in 2022 through our continuous improvement program, and we're confident we'll achieve our full year target. As you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 11. Overall, we saw broad improvements across all categories. Nonperforming loans of $2 billion decreased $252 million or 11% compared to March 31, and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies were $1.5 billion on June 30, a $188 million decline linked quarter, reflecting lower consumer and commercial loan delinquencies, which included the resolution of acquisition-related administrative and operational delays. Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $83 million, a decrease of $54 million linked quarter, driven by lower consumer net charge-offs, primarily within the auto portfolio. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans continues to be historically low at 11 basis points. And during the second quarter, our allowance for credit losses remained essentially stable, and our reserves now total $5.1 billion or 1.7% of total loans. In summary, PNC reported a solid second quarter, and we're well positioned for the second half of 2022 as we continue to realize the potential of our coast-to-coast franchise. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we expect the pace of economic growth to slow over the remainder of 2022, resulting in 2% average annual real GDP growth. We also expect the Fed to raise rates by an additional cumulative 175 basis points through the remainder of this year to a range of 3.25% to 3.5% by year-end. Looking at the third quarter of 2022, compared to the second quarter of 2022, we expect average loan balances to be up 1% to 2%. We expect net interest income to be up 10% to 12%. We expect noninterest income to be down 3% to 5%, which results in total revenue increasing 4% to 6%. We expect total noninterest expense to be stable to up 1%. And we expect third quarter net charge-offs to be between $125 million and $175 million. Considering our reported operating results for the first half of 2022, third quarter expectations, and current economic forecast for the full year 2022 compared to the full year 2021, we expect average loan growth of approximately 13% by an 8% loan growth on a spot basis. We expect total revenue growth to be 9% to 11%. Our revenue outlook for the full year is unchanged from the guidance we provided in April. However, relative to our expectations at that time, we now expect more net interest income from higher rates, offset by somewhat lower fees. We expect expenses, excluding integration expense to be up 4% to 6%. And we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions. Yes, probably both, but a little bit more of the former. We're just at that point now where we're seeing rates rising to the point where the betas are becoming active. They were not that active on the consumer side, a little bit on the commercial side in the first quarter, and that's picked up a bit. More on the commercial side as we expected, and in our case, it's our nonoperating deposits that explains the decline there in the second quarter. So betas are beginning to move. We expected that, and we're ready for it. And some normalization. Saying just -- and Bill mentioned it, Gerard, just some normalization, which is inevitable. Yes, that's right. Well, the context -- Bill, as you know, the context of your question is historically pre sort of the rapid increase in liquidity over the last couple of years, we did run about 20% of our securities to our earning assets. We raised that because of all the liquidity in the system. So we're still pretty high on a historical basis, but it's still -- Demchak just said, that's not likely to change anytime soon. Yes. Yes. And I would just add to that. In terms of the loan growth outlook for the 12 months, we're up a bit, mostly because of the outperformance in the first half relative to our expectations. So that's sort of truing up, so to speak. Right. And I would add to that, our reserve levels are above our day 1 fee so even adjusted for the BBVA acquisition, we're appropriately reserved. Now -- and feel good about it. Yes, that's right, Ken. Yes, that's exactly right. So higher rate environment, NII and the balances that we've generated contribute to the improved NII look. And then you sort of referenced it in terms of the fees, mostly in terms of our full year expectations compared to what we thought at the beginning of the year and last quarter, some softer on AMG and mortgage, as you would expect, with the equity markets performing like they are for AMG and interest rates on the mortgage side. So it's sort of a -- the trade-off of the higher rates. So on the fee side, again, for the full year, most of the change relative to our full year expectations is within AMG and mortgage. On capital markets, you'll recall, we had a soft first quarter relative to our expectations. We did see the bounce back in the second quarter. So we're back in position with our full year expectations in the second half, obviously remains to be seen. Well, in part. I think the earlier question you might have missed it, Erika, was the improved outlook for the full year loan growth. The answer was most of that was a true-up to our outperformance in the first half. So we grew loans faster than we thought we would in the first 6 months, which is great. So we true-up that full year expectation. So all of that is built in to the full year guidance. That's another component. That's right. Yes. And our expectations, Erika, are generally stable, but Bill pointed the mix could be different. And then an open question on the nonoperational deposits, which we'll either do or not do. And importantly, are, by definition low margin. Yes. And we've done that in the past. I can jump on that, and we covered some of that, Mike. Generally speaking, and we recognize the fluidity. For the second half, we're calling for stable deposits, some mix change between noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing also an open question in terms of nonoperational deposits and what betas are required for that and whether we choose to keep those or not. So that all remains to be seen. But the outlook is stable. And NIM, we do expect to expand. Yes, in particular, and it overlaps, Mike, particularly on the utilization, which has grown. That's right. We don't do that. We don't do that. CECL is a model-driven approach. And as you pointed out, Mike, we're above our day 1. We're appropriately reserved relative to our book. Sure. And we'd like to do that. Yes. I mean, it's pretty stable, John. So no big mix changes, no big dollar changes. The percentage came down a little bit just because of largely the high credit quality, large underwritings we just spoke about improving the mix. So pretty much unchanged. Yes, yes. We don't give explicit NIM outlook. But I would say your question is when does NIM peak. We see NIMs continuing to expand and peaking in '23. So with everything that you described we still see upside in them. Yes, possibly. And again, we're in sort of that context, we're talking about '23 then. 2023. That's right. That's right. Yes. That's right. That's why we're still -- some part -- some ways from the peak. Yes. And, to your point, we're well reserved. And multifamily, which is the biggest component of that, is very strong. I did in my opening comments. We're going to continue buying back shares roughly at the average rate of what we've been doing the last couple of quarters. I was going to say that, Bill said there was an earlier impossible question. Yes, that 1 might be number two. --recovery. Yes, right. 15% to 20%. Not to that extent. To your point, if it's being extrapolated from COVID scenario -- Right.\nMatt Oa\u0302\u0080\u0099Connor: And then just the flip side got a little over $8 billion of losses in OCI. Obviously, a lot of that comes back over time, the part that's related to the bond book. Just give us a rule of thumb like how much of that accretes back each year if rates stay here on the kind of the medium, longer-term part of the curve? We disclosed that, Bryan. It's a couple of hundred million. Well, the short answer is approximately $200 million a quarter, $1 billion a year. So that's the number you're looking for. But that's the right neighborhood. Held to the maturity. Yes, the held to maturity. Which is dependent on rates. Right. Yes, roughly. Yes, roughly. Well, that also relates to the deposit pricing and what we choose to do. So yes, you're right. We have room and flexibility there as we go through these increased betas and a growing loan environment. Right. Yes. Yes, that's my point. That's the flexibility so we can, and we can view these deposits in terms of whether we want to take for that -- That's a good -- Yes. That's what I said. That's right. And there's a structure component. There's a lot of good companies out there that don't have structures that we would lend into that they could change that. Big opportunity. We don't need to worry about that right now. We just need to do more. Thank you."

            "name": "Bill Demchak",
            "content": "Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you've seen, we had a strong second quarter, highlighted by 9% revenue growth and solid positive operating leverage resulting in PPNR growth of 23%. We maintained strong credit quality and fees rebounded from the first quarter, driven primarily by capital markets activity, including Harris Williams, and continued growth in card and cash management. The strong loan growth and rising rates helped us to increase both net interest income and net interest margin meaningfully. Loan growth was driven by C&I, where new production increased significantly and utilization returned to near pre-pandemic levels. Consumer loans also grew, driven by mortgage and home equity. Higher rates continued to adversely impact the unrealized value of our securities book. In response, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve continued to reposition the portfolio during the quarter, resulting in 60% of our securities portfolio now being held and held to maturity. We returned $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders during the quarter through share repurchases and dividends. Looking forward, there is uncertainty in the environment we're operating and including the impact of higher rates, supply chain disruptions and inflation. But regardless of the path ahead macroeconomically, we believe having a strong balance sheet, a solid mix of fee-based businesses, continued focus on expense management and differentiated strategies for organic growth will continue to provide the foundation for our success. And our focus is on executing the things we can control and not getting distracted by what is beyond our control. Along those lines, we delivered well on our strategic priorities in the quarter, including the build-out of our new BBVA and expansion markets, modernizing our retail banking technology platform, bolstering our asset management offering and building differentiated and responsible capabilities for our retail and commercial customers in the payment space. As I've talked about recently at conferences, our performance in the BBVA markets has exceeded our own expectations. On Slide 3, you can see the strong growth we've generated in these markets across customer segments. In corporate banking, we've seen sales increase 40% linked quarter and maintained a 50% noncredit mix of sales since conversion. We've seen similar growth within commercial banking, where sales in the BBVA USA markets are up 32% linked quarter and noncredit sales to total sales have been approximately 55% since conversion. In retail banking, we've experienced a notable increase in sales for both small businesses and consumers of 16% and 22%, respectively. And we continue to invest in AMG, and a big part of that is building a strong customer-focused team that can deliver our brand across our footprint. We have built good momentum in our recruiting efforts over the past few quarters, hiring advisers across all areas of the business to help deliver for our clients. I'll close by thanking our employees for their hard work and dedication to our customers and communities. Moving forward, we believe that we're well positioned to continue to grow shareholder value. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our results, and then we'll take your questions. Yes. Look, I don't think there's any cliff involved. I do think that the trouble ahead lies somewhere in the middle of next year not any time in the next 6 months. But what you're seeing inside of our credit book, you got to remember that during this period of time, we continue to kind of run off a higher risk book from BBVA, and our loan growth is largely in higher quality names. So the overall quality of our book actually improves quarter-on-quarter. Eventually, that has to stop. And eventually, I think the Fed has to slow the economy to a pace to get inflation under control, and I think that's going to be harder to do than the market currently assumes, and I think it's going to take longer than the market currently assumes. And when that happens, we're going to see credit costs go up at least back to what we would call normalized levels. But I don't think -- I don't see any particular bubbles inside of the banking system as it relates to credit. I think you're just going to see a slow grind with credit losses increasing over time as we get into the slowdown. I think, over time that is probably likely if we continue to see loan growth we do. But you shouldn't mix security balances with the way we think about fixed rate exposure hedging our deposits, right? Securities are one way we do that, swaps are another way, and then, of course, our fixed rate assets themselves. And then inside of that, the duration of the securities we buy. So long story short, the balance is probably decline, but we're sitting in a period of time right now where we're very asset sensitive. You'll notice our balances basically stayed flat through the course of the quarter as we kind of purposely watch and let things roll off here given our view on what we think longer term rates are going to ultimately do. So balances could go down just as a matter of sort of algebra in the balance sheet, but our ability to invest in rising rates is still there in a large way. A lot of it just comes from our ability to win new business. Utilization rates have largely approached where we were, I think, Rob, pre pandemic at this point. So there's a little bit of room there. But these new markets and our -- just our ability to win new business. And by the way, new business that is 50% fee-based is pretty strong. And we feel confident we'll be able to continue to do that independent of what happens in the economy. That's an impossible question to answer given the dynamics of CECL. But you should assume -- we assume that, all else equal, credit quality is going to deteriorate at some pace from here through the next 2 years. I just don't think it's going to be all that dramatic. And it almost has to be a true statement given the charge-off levels that we've been seeing. We don't think about the swaps book separate from our basic investing and fixed rate exposure. Where we sit across the securities book and swaps and everything we do fixed rate, we're looking at a curve now where I kind of think the year-end rates, in my own mind, are probably largely right, but I think there's a -- I think the assumption that the Fed is going to start easing in the spring of next year is absurd, which means we're holding off at this point because we think there's going to be -- there's still value to be had in the longer end of the curve as people come to the realization that inflation isn't as easy to tame as people might assume. And separately that the Fed isn't going to immediately cut simply because the economy slows if inflation is still running high. So we're going to sit pat, but not -- we don't think swaps are one thing in bonds or another. We just -- we look at our interest rate exposure. We're very asset sensitive. We have an opportunity to deploy in multiple places. We're just not doing it. We basically let everything run down thus far this year. Part of the impact that we're seeing in NII and NIM is actually on our loan yields, where the quality of our book is it improves fairly substantially. We've put a lot of very high-grade stuff on. And spreads have actually come in quarter-on-quarter. So when we look at the out forecast on NII, together with loan growth, which will be pretty healthy, we have in there -- embedded in there this notion that spreads are tighter than they were as we basically improve the quality of the book. Yes. Yes. Well, it's a good question, and the answer remains to be seen a little bit. We've clearly seen the larger corporates move liquidity out of the banking system into money markets, government money markets. And I think, as we go forward, the combination of QT from the Fed and what they do with their repo facility is going to drive some of the yield available in those funds, which in turn is going to drive how much of that sits on bank's balance sheets or not. Outside of those deposits, it's more about a rate paid game. And I think deposits kind of inside of the retail space and the smaller mid-market commercial space, I think deposits actually grow simply because of the loan volume. But the mix shift that we've seen in commercial from a little bit less noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing, that game is going to play out. So thus far, I mean, if you look at total liquidity in the system, it really hasn't moved. And of course, the Fed hasn't really started their QT program yet. What we've seen is a movement of liquidity from banks into money funds as money fund yields started to grow. So this is going to take a while to play out. Yes. A big part of what we've seen go thus far are kind of deposits that we don't really care about. They were -- we kind of call them surge deposits internally, which were noncore clients' parking liquidity that now have kind of gone into funds. Yes. Yes. Well, first, I want to see the audit on only 16% of corporate credit being inside of banks, but I'm sure there's some way you can get that right. No, we -- its credit outside of the banking system melts. We play in that in 2 ways. One is, if it's in the real estate space, we do that inside of our special servicing arm in Midland. Two is we are very good at working corporate credits, and we wouldn't be afraid of buying portfolios of troubled assets. And three, and I think this is what you're referring to is in our asset-based lending group, we play the role of senior lender on a very secured basis for -- and basically the agent for the entire capital structure. And as pieces below us struggle, the fee opportunity for us to work those loans out on behalf of the B lenders is quite high. Furthermore, we continue to be approached by multiple B lenders to basically run their books as they look at what's coming their way. Thus far, we haven't agreed to do any of that. And were we to do it, I think it'd be quite lucrative. Yes. Yes. It depends on the lending sector. So we are, for example, an asset-based -- straight spreads on high rated stuff has kind of stabilized. A lot of what we're seeing is just a mix shift in the quality of our book, not a change in the market in terms of spread where I think the market continues to be irrational is on the consumer side. So auto lending seems, in our view, to be a little bit of a bubble, and some of the things we're still seeing being done on the consumer side. But on the corporate side, on the real estate side, the shift is moving back towards the banks in terms of our ability to negotiate and get spread and get covenants and get structure. Just not a dramatic shift the way you've seen in some of the headline stuff on capital markets related issues. No. I mean it's -- thank you for reminding. I mean that's what happened, right? We've had inventory build and CapEx and a little volume back to the banks and boom, you get big loan growth. Yes. But that's coming off of their inventory, Bill, which overlaps. Yes. Mike, most of those players play in a risk bucket that we don't like to play in, right? So the exception to that is, in our asset-based lending book, where borrowers who might have been able to do a cash flow loan with a BDC at one point are now going to come back to the banks and do it asset-based. But on the consumer side, the guys who are out there playing subprime consumer or even in the leverage lending side, cash flow unsecured, we just don't have a big book of business there, nor do we want one. It's -- we have a model and we run by a model. So we're not allowed to just -- As much as I'd like to sometimes put my thumb on the scale. We're not -- We'd like to see additional flows in that type of lending. It's kind of -- that was client -- a handful of clients, but client-specific timing issues that we were able to serve client needs and their big balances, and they're going to run off. Yes. That happens again, that's great. But these were specific ones we called out both because of their size and also because there are lower spreads in the rest of the book and that had some impact on the loan yield this quarter. Eventually, what you're going to see, we've seen utilizations go up as people have built inventories. Now that will reverse itself as we get into a slowdown and people struggle to move inventories, it will peak and then they'll grind it to a halt. But I think that's going to end up being the driver. We'll continue to go work and gain share. And ultimately, against the money we put out, we look at what happens to utilization and utilization will start to drop through a slowdown, peak early into it and then slow down as they try to free up working capital. Without getting into the details of CECL, I would tell you that we -- within our overall provision, we added 2 reserves as a function of the scenarios we run. Well, no, so to clarify that. In terms of the dollar amounts and the stable. But inside of that, obviously, our scenarios built in some worsening concepts. But there's QFR as part of that process that offset that. So end of the day, stable. Yes, you have to. The number of pieces that are moving inside of that, even if let's assume they get out there and they just freeze and you have a small inversion in the curve and you sit there, in that instance, betas probably don't move from wherever they were post the last hike. And instead, what you're going to see is a increase in fixed rate asset yields that basically roll off from very low yields into higher yields. And then the upside to the extent we want to deploy at that point. So you see a gain in yields inside of the security book in a static environment simply because everything that was purchased with 1.5% handles rolls off. The inventory question is all over the place because you have a bunch of customers who have more inventory than they want. And you have others who are still struggling to build inventory to keep up with supply because of continued supply chain disruption. So I don't know that there's a simple answer on inventories. Real estate, with the exception of the slow burn on office, where we just -- we continue to be worried, we continue to see slow deterioration, we think we're really well reserved. But absent that kind of slow burn, the rest of it continues to kind of do okay to improve. And I think that holds even at least on the slowdown that's in the back of my mind. Again, I just don't see some big spike into a really ugly recession. So we have our eye on real estate. We have exposure into the office space that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re reserved against. It's kind of doing what we expected. And beyond that, we're not particularly worried about it. No way to answer that. But, I mean, remember that reserve build in COVID, the scenarios we are running, I don't remember off the top of my head if ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s the kind of employment to 15%, higher GDP. We're not -- this has nothing to do with that, right? We're going to go into a slowdown and we're going to see an increase in reserves at some point, but they're not even going to be related to the thing we saw when COVID hit  economy down. Yes, just in terms of size. So you almost have to take that whole example set and remove it from the framework of how you think about provisions going forward.\nMatt Oa\u0302\u0080\u0099Connor: Right. So it seems like you're implying, and we've heard from some others that it should be a lot less. But I guess we'll see. No, no. I can't a\u0302\u0080\u0093 Matt, I mean -- Only if you think about what those forecasts were, right? I mean, do you remember, they were unemployment going to -- 15% Yes. I mean it was I don't think there's anybody out there who thinks we have to cater the economy by that amount to get inflation under control. That was -- look, there could be some world event that causes that, but it's not going to be a function of the Fed raising rates and slowing the economy to get inflation under control.\nMatt Oa\u0302\u0080\u0099Connor: Yes, agreed. I mean obviously, that's what the marketa\u0302\u0080\u0099s still worried about. And it's just interesting, if you put it relative to capital, even if you did what you did for COVID, it's only 50 basis points of capital. So -- Matt, look you're bringing up -- this whole issue is the issue, I think, that investors just have completely wrong about the banking system right now. If you look at the market cap that's been pulled out of the banking system and take your worst case reserve build and charge-offs through some cycle, it's just wildly wrong. Yes. We'll have increased losses, but -- Not to anything close like what we put in during COVID. And more importantly, I think there's a growth opportunity through a mild downturn for us, just given the way we run our business and the business that will come back into the banking systems and out of the capital markets. So I am personally confused about all the concern that sits out there on banking reserves and the coming recession and the impacts on the profitability of banks. It will hurt a little bit, but -- It's just -- again, that's a data point that needs removed. Well, the held-to-maturity accretes back independent this point. And I don't know you guys -- I mean the way we kind of think about it internally, given how much we moved is we ought to have pulled a par on the held-to-maturity book adding to our capital base at a pace that largely hedges us against further declines in AOCI and the available-for-sale book, depending how much of a spike their rates are versus the rolled up. But we feel pretty good about the mix we have at this point. And obviously, it's not impacting our capital flexibility vis-a-vis the way we look at AOCI in terms -- inside of regulatory capital.\nMatt Oa\u0302\u0080\u0099Connor: Yes. And I guess what I was asking is like if we just think over the next few years, right, like all that OCI eventually gets reversed back as the bonds mature, you are saddled with $8 billion of losses like a lot of banks, having a drag. I'm just wondering what's a good rule of thumb? Does that $8 billion come back, kind of maybe $1.5 billion, $2 billion a year or something like that? I mean, let's say we've got a  7 years or something. Sorry, that's out of the held to maturity. We have a separate AOCI loss available for sale. Look, if it's high quality, we'd love to go back to 83%. If it's in our risk box and coupled with client relationships where we have really strong cross-sell, that would be a great outcome. No. I don't think. I mean, look, our intention here is to keep deposits and grow deposits if we can without having to be aggressive on rate. It's very simple. And inside of that, we'd like to grow loans. And if we manage to do the 2 things there and grow loan to deposits to 83%, we'll be making  load of money given the fee mix we get when we grow loans. That would be a great thing to be able to do, and wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re going to work on it. Yes. I think about it all the time. I don't know when I go into details on my own financial situation, but it's -- I see a lot of value there. It's interesting. We've had a bunch of senior execs actually enroll in our employee stock purchase plan -- Which maybe is a simple way for me to get a few shares here and there. But look, I think there's a lot of value. I don't know that you're going to see me make a giant purchase because, as you said, I own a lot of stock, and it's most of my net worth. Look, it's -- I mean pricing ultimately is market-driven. And it's -- I would expect, for a given credit quality, we're going to see small backup. Of course, pricing is also based on a grid. So as we go into a slower economy and people run another turn of leverage given their performance, we'll see jumps in spreads that's built into the existing contract because spreads are performance based on a lot of the loans that we do. So I -- -- we'll get there. More important to us, Mike, is the cross-sell that we ultimately get. At the end loan prices -- as long as we get good structure, pricing is important, but pricing along with the majority of the TM relationship and capital markets business really ups the return that you get from that client relationship. It's small. Big opportunity. Opportunity is big. Thanks, everybody."

        "content": "Bryan Gill: Welcome to today's conference of The PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These materials are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of April 14, 2022, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Demchak : Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you've seen, we had a solid start to the year as we grew loans and securities, controlled expenses and our credit quality reserves and capital levels remain very strong. As we previously disclosed, noninterest income was below our expectations for the quarter. And while we had expected fees to be down sequentially, reflecting typical first quarter seasonality, the decline actually exceeded normal interest rate volatility and probably, the Russian-Ukraine conflict adversely impacted certain of our capital markets businesses among other areas.  As we look forward, we're clearly in an environment of uncertainty here. We're also in an environment with rising interest rates, which benefit banks with increased loan demand, which benefit banks. And in PNC's case, a business or a bank that never changed its credit box on credit terms got really easy business that has a very -- or a bank that is a very solid mix of fee-based businesses, and importantly, a bank that has substantially expanded its geographic presence. And I want to hit on that in a second just as it relates to our progress on BBVA. And I would tell you, I just -- I couldn't be more proud of what we've been able to accomplish over the last about 15 months in total now, but in particular, over the last couple of quarters. And we still have a lot of work to do, but to put it in perspective, our staffing is largely complete. And our calling effort, particularly versus the fourth quarter, has increased substantially, and our sales and pipelines are robust.  Just to give you an idea of the activity behind this, in the legacy BBVA USA geographies, corporate commercial banking costs have doubled since the fourth quarter, and sales have increased almost 50%. And as we expected across CNIB, nearly half of these sales were actually non-credit related and the BBVA USA geographies.  We switch to the retail side. We're obviously focused on building customer relationships. Just to give you an idea, our sales per branch were approximately 60% higher in March compared to what they were in December with improvements across mortgages, cards and referrals to PNC investments. In our Asset Management group, we're making great progress and strategic investments to hire key people in business development and adviser roles, and importantly, our client opportunity pipelines are really strong. From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to deploy our excess liquidity as you've seen with solid loan growth and securities purchases. Spot loans grew $6 billion in the quarter, driven by the commercial side, which saw a nice increase in utilization. In fact, if we exclude the impact of PPP loan forgiveness, spot commercial loans grew $7 billion. The fastest organic quarterly growth we've seen since the commercial defensive draws that we saw at the start of the pandemic. And by the way, we've seen that growth carry into the early part of April.  We also remain active on the security side with net purchases of almost $6 billion during the quarter. From a balance sheet perspective, the securities were offset by unrealized losses due to rising interest rates, which Rob is going to discuss in a few minutes. This doesn't impact our regulatory capital or earnings, but during the quarter, we moved approximately $20 billion of our securities available for sale to help the maturity to limit future valuation changes due to interest rate movements. Importantly, we saw a solid rebound in the yield on our securities. Overall, we believe we are well positioned for the rising interest rate environment to deliver net interest income growth and NIM expansion throughout the year. And finally, during the quarter, we returned about $1.7 billion of capital to shareholders through share repurchase dividends. And importantly, based on our performance and strong capital levels to the Board's confidence in our execution of our strategic priorities, we recently announced a substantial increase to our quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share to $1.50, or 20%. I just want to close by thanking our employees for their hard work and dedication to our customers and communities. Moving forward, as I said, we believe we are well positioned to continue to grow shareholder value as the economy normalizes stats move higher than we realized the full potential of the combined PNC and BBVA USA franchise. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our results, and then we'll take your questions.\nRob Reilly : Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis. During the quarter, loans increased by $2 billion or 1%. Investment securities grew $6 billion or 5%, and Federal Reserve cash balances declined $13 billion or 17%, reflecting higher securities and loan balances as well as lower borrowed funds. Deposit balances averaged $453 billion and were relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. Our tangible book value was $79.68 per common share as of March 31, a 15% decline linked quarter, which was entirely driven by mark-to-market adjustments in our securities and swap portfolios as a result of higher interest rates. As a category 3 institution, we opted out of recognizing AOCI and regulatory capital, and as of March 31, 2022, our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 9.9%. Given our strong capital ratios, we continue to be well positioned with significant capital flexibility. And as Bill just mentioned, our Board recently approved a $0.25 increase to our quarterly cash dividend on common stock, raising the dividend to $1.50 per share. Additionally, during the first quarter, we completed share repurchases of $1.2 billion or 6.4 million shares. Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Average loans increased $2 billion linked quarter, and on a spot basis, loans grew $6 billion, or 2%. PPP loan balances continued to decline and impacted first quarter growth by approximately $2 billion on both an average and spot basis. Looking at loan growth, excluding the impact of PPP loans, average loans increased $4 billion or 1%, driven by $5 billion of growth in commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by a $1 billion decline in commercial real estate balances and average consumer loans were stable linked quarter.  On a spot basis, loans grew $8 billion. Commercial loans grew $7 billion, driven by higher utilization as well as new production within corporate banking and business credit businesses. Notably, in our C&IB segment, the utilization rate increased 85 basis points and our overall commitments were 2% higher compared to year-end 2021. And consumer loans increased $900 million as higher mortgage balances were partially offset by lower auto and credit card loans. Moving to Slide 5. Average deposits of $453 billion remained stable compared to the fourth quarter. On the right, you can see total deposits at period end were $450 billion, a decline of $7 billion or 2% linked quarter. All of the decline was on the commercial side where deposits were $10 billion lower, primarily driven by seasonal cash deployments. Partially offsetting the commercial decline, consumer deposits increased $3 billion, reflecting seasonally higher balances related to tax refund payments. Overall, our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits remained stable at 4 basis points, and importantly, we remain core funded with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 65% at the end of the first quarter. Slide 6 details the change in our average securities and federal reserve balances. We've maintained high levels of liquidity over the past year while opportunistically purchasing securities. This trend continued into the first quarter as we added primarily U.S. treasuries and agency RMBS. As a result, average security balances increased by 5% or $6 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, and now represent 27% of interest-earning assets. Slide 7 highlights the composition of our high-quality securities portfolio as well as the balance changes from year-end March 31. During the first quarter, we added to our portfolio with net purchases of approximately $6 billion. However, the increase in rates during the first quarter resulted in higher net unrealized losses of approximately $6 billion, and accordingly, our period-end balances remained relatively state.  To moderate the impact of rising rates on security values and correspondingly AOCI, we transferred approximately $20 billion of securities from our available-for-sale portfolio and to help maturity at quarter end. Importantly, fluctuations in AOCI did not have an impact on our earnings. However, we are mindful of the AOC impact on tangible book value, and we'll continue to evaluate potential opportunities to further transit. Turning to the income statement on Slide 8. As you can see, first quarter 2022 reported EPS was $3.23, which included pre-tax integration costs of $31 million. Excluding integration costs, adjusted EPS was $3.29. During the first quarter, integration costs reduced revenue by $16 million and increased expenses by $15 million. First quarter revenue was down $435 million or 8% compared with the fourth quarter. Expenses declined $619 million or 16% linked quarter, and excluding the impact of integration expenses, noninterest expense declined 7%. The first quarter provision recapture was $208 million, primarily reflecting the impact of improved COVID-19-related economic conditions, and our effective tax rate was 17%. So in total, net income was $1.4 billion in the first quarter. Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Slide 9 details our revenue trends. Total revenue for the first quarter of $4.7 billion defined $430 million linked quarter. Net interest income of $2.8 billion was down $58 million, or 2%. Higher securities and loan balances as well as increased security yields were more than offset by a $74 million decline in PPP revenue due to loan forgiveness activity and the impact of 2 fewer days in the quarter. And net interest margin of 2.28% was up 1 basis point.  As we recently announced and effective for the first quarter, we recategorized the presentation of our noninterest income and provided an update to the related guidance. Consistent with those revisions, first quarter fee income was $1.7 billion, a decline of $296 million or 15% linked quarter. Looking at the detail of each revenue category. Asset management and brokerage fees decreased $8 million or 2%, reflecting lower average equity markets. Capital markets-related fees declined $208 million or 45%, driven by lower M&A advisory fees mostly due to elevated fourth quarter transaction levels, but also some delayed transaction activity in the first quarter. Card and Cash Management revenue decreased $26 million or 4%, driven by seasonally lower consumer spending activity.  Lending and deposit services was essentially stable linked quarter, declining only $4 million. Residential and commercial mortgage noninterest income was $50 million lower, primarily due to decreased commercial mortgage activity. And finally, other noninterest income declined $81 million, primarily due to lower private equity-related revenue and once again compared to elevated fourth quarter levels. Turning to Slide 10. Our first quarter expenses were down by $619 million or 16%. Excluding the impact of integration expenses, noninterest expense declined $243 million or 7%. The majority of the decline was a lower personnel expense, primarily reflecting the lower incentive compensation. We remain deliberate around our expense management.  At year-end 2021, we achieved our objective to reduce BBVA USA's annual operating expense run rate by $900 million. And as we previously stated, we have a goal to reduce costs by $300 million in 2022 through our continuous improvement program, and we're confident we'll achieve our full year target. As you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business on technology investments. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 11. Nonperforming loans of $2.3 billion decreased $182 million or 7% compared to December 31, and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies were $1.7 billion on March 31, a $286 million decline from year-end, reflecting lower consumer and commercial loan delinquencies. The majority of these decreases resulted from our progress in resolving BBVA USA conversion-related, administrative and operational delays.  Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $137 million, an increase of $13 million linked quarter. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans continues to be historically low at 19 basis points. And during the first quarter, we reduced our allowance for credit losses by approximately $300 million, and our reserves now total $5.2 billion or 1.8% of total loans. In summary, PNC reported a solid first quarter, and we're well positioned for the remainder of 2022 as we continue to realize the potential of our coast-to-coast franchise. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we expect strong growth over the course of 2022, resulting in 3.7% average GDP growth. We also expect the Fed to raise rates by an additional cumulative 175 basis points through the remainder of this year to a range of 2% to 2.25% by year-end, and all of this is consistent with the update in our recent 8-K filing.  Looking at the second quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2022, we expect average loan balances to be up 2% to 3%, which includes a $1.3 billion decline in PPP loans. We expect net interest income to be up 10% to 12%. We expect noninterest income to be up 6% to 8%, which results in total revenue increasing 9% to 11%. We expect total noninterest expense to be up 3% to 5%, and we expect second quarter net charge-offs to be between $125 million and $175 million.  Considering our reported first quarter operating results, second quarter expectations and current economic forecasts for the full year 2022 compared to the full year 2021, we expect average loan growth of approximately 10% and spot loan growth of 5%. We expect total revenue growth to be 9% to 11%. We expect expenses, excluding integration expense, to be at 4% to 6%. And we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.\nOperator:  Our first question is from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.\nJohn Pancari: Want to see if you could give us a little bit more color on how you're thinking about the capital markets revenues here? Obviously, you saw a pretty good step down this quarter, given the activity that the broader markets all clearly. Just wanted to get your thoughts on how we can expect to think about the remaining quarters, if you think you could see an increase from here? And if the capital markets outlook has impacted your full year revenue view, is that baked in there as well?\nRob Reilly: Yes, sure. John, it's Rob. So in regard to capital markets, you'll recall, at the beginning of the year, our expectations for capital markets was to be down approximately 20% or so from '21 levels just because the '21 levels were so elevated. The first quarter was slower than we expected even at those reduced levels, but for the full year guide, I have most of that back in there. So most of what we expected to occur in the first quarter that didn't occur is still in the full year guidance. So that's why we're still 9% to 11% growth.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. Got it. All right. That's helpful. And then, Rob, secondly, on the deposit side. Just given the move in rates that we're looking at here, clearly, a lot of focus on deposit flows. For the spot balances, you saw about a 2% decline in your deposits there. Can you maybe give us a little bit of color on what you're seeing in terms of the positive behavior here near term? Is that more commercially oriented in terms of the deposits that you saw, in terms of the decline? And then can you talk about your betas that you think you'll see in the near term as rates rise and then further after the first 100 Fed hikes?\nRob Reilly: Yes. Okay. This is Rob again, John. So on the deposits in the quarter, we saw a spot decline and all of that was on the commercial side, which we see as largely seasonal. Consumer deposits on a spot basis were actually up, reflecting tax refunds and some seasonality there. So that\u2019s the story on the deposits. So the full year in regard to the betas relative to what we expected at the beginning of the year, we have increased our betas consistent with the increase in the Fed rate hike forecast. Along the lines of what we saw in the last cycle, maybe a little bit less just because we're working off such high levels. Very quiet \u2013 as you pointed out, very quiet on the first 100 basis points or so, but showing up \u2013 if our rate forecast is correct, showing up in the third and fourth quarter.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. If I could ask just one more thing on the loan side. I mean you mentioned the higher line utilization on the commercial side. Are you beginning to see CapEx plans drive loan demand? And then lastly, are you seeing any of the volume coming back from the capital markets back to the bank loan market yet on the commercial side?\nBill Demchak: I think the utilization is part of \u2013 reflects part of the slowdown on the capital market side in bonds. Clients continue to be active. So yes, some pickup in CapEx build in inventory. The other thing we\u2019re seeing beyond the utilization change, I think we saw a similar percentage increase in just new dollars out \u2013 sorry, not percentage, but notional amount increase of new DHE commitments out. So some of its utilization, some of its winning clients, utilization driven by capital markets being a bit of disarray together with increased CapEx.\nRob Reilly: And higher inventory levels, of course, yes.\nBill Demchak: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.\nScott Siefers: So Rob, it was great to see you reiterate the full year \u201822 revenue outlook. And I think you sort of addressed this in response to the capital markets question previously, but I was hoping broadly, you could just kind of parse the guide between what comes from NII and what comes from fees? I think 90 days or so ago, you guys have been thinking maybe mid-single digit all-in growth for \u201822, if I remember correctly, but just given sort of the change in reporting and back others, et cetera. Just curious to your thoughts.\nRob Reilly: Sure. Sure. So 9 to 11 total for the full year. Compared to the beginning of the year, net interest income is a bigger component of that because of the rate increases and the higher balances. So we\u2019re looking at that to be inside of that 9 to 11, the NII and the high teens. And then on the core fee piece, looking more towards flattish to maybe down low single digits, and most of the change there being on the mortgage outlook from the beginning of the year. So most of our fee categories are tracking to what we expected for the full year, including capital markets, as I just mentioned, but mortgage were off from what we thought at the beginning of the year because of rates. So residential and commercial mortgage, we expect it to be down low single digits. We\u2019re now looking at maybe down 25% or 30% year-over-year. So that\u2019s where the fee change is largely resident.\nOperator:  Our next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: So you\u2019re guiding for 9% to 11% revenue growth at 4% to 6% expense growth. So you\u2019re guiding now for 500 basis points of positive operating leverage. I\u2019m just curious, aren\u2019t you tempted to spend some of that and invest more of those, that spread? And I relate this \u2013 I\u2019m not telling you to do or not do, I\u2019m just \u2013 there\u2019s always a trade-off. But I want to tie this back to your CEO letter, Bill, where your first goal was to gain share in especially our new markets. And your second goal was to improve share with your customers. So I guess, the concrete question is, give any metrics to say, what kind of share you like to improve by market and by corporate and consumer customer? And to do that, are you tempted to spend some of that excess of the revenue growth over expense growth?\nBill Demchak: Thanks for the question, Mike. In short, we don\u2019t have to. We\u2019ve always been investing in our franchise. So if you think about \u2013 we talk about our new markets, as I said in my comments, they are largely staffed at this point. And so if I think about our people spend, we\u2019re kind of where we need to be. If I think about our technology spend, we\u2019ve been going hard at that for a number of years, and we\u2019re more in the place of what can we actually get done in a sequence timeline, and we are about, hey, spend more money. So you\u2019re not going to see increases against what we expected in that space. So anyway, short answer to the question is, no, we don't need to spend the money, and not spending the money in no way detracts for \u2013from the growth that I think we\u2019re capable of.\nRob Reilly: Or another way, you\u2019re not spending the money on investments and that\u2019s part of the guide.\nBill Demchak: Yes. Another way to put it, yes.\nMike Mayo: So it\u2019s baked in. And can you put some numbers around your CEO letter? Like I said, it\u2019s \u2013 your 3 goals gained share by your markets, being shared by customers and technology, at least for your first 2 goals. Where is it share today? And where you hope to get it to? You have not given that before, but it\u2019d be nice to know, is it bigger than a bread  or what?\nBill Demchak: No, it\u2019s a fair question. I don\u2019t know that you were going to define share by share of C&I loans in the market. I think what we have to do, and we\u2019re working on, Mike, is presentation of just progress in underpenetrated markets compared to what we execute in one of our mature markets and then tracking that for you. I think that\u2019s the best metric. So we look at loan balances. We look at fees. We look at percent of fees as a percentage of total revenues. We look at calling volume. We look at new clients, all the things you\u2019d expect us to, and we need to figure out and I\u2019ll commit to you that we will \u2013 we need to put out metrics so you can track it through time. We do it internally.\nMike Mayo: And then lastly, as it relates to buybacks, you had the book value, regulatory capital dichotomy here, which wins out when you think about buybacks?\nBill Demchak: I\u2019m not sure I follow the question.\nMike Mayo: 9.9% CET1 ratio. So that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s good, but your book value went down. That\u2019s not as good. Do you still buy back the same amount of stock? Do you slow buyback? Do you  impact.\nBill Demchak: Yes. Yes. Yes. So if you\u2019re simply asking the question, do we view our available capital based on the 9 90, the answer to that is, yes.\nMike Mayo: Okay. And then does that mean you continue to pace the buybacks? Or how do you think about that?\nBill Demchak: We\u2019re going to be in the market. It\u2019s obviously \u2013 I think it\u2019s more attractive today to buy back shares than it was towards the end of the year. So we\u2019re going to be in the market, and I don\u2019t know what we probably said.\nRob Reilly: No, no, that\u2019s right. The answer is, it is the regulatory capital that we look at, Mike. And the current pace that we\u2019ve been on, we expect to continue. That average quarter \u2013 the average quarterly pace, we were a little bit more this past quarter.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.\nBill Carcache: Following up on your deposit beta expectations being a bit lower in this cycle, given all the liquidity in the system. You said on the last call that you'd expect to see higher betas if the Fed shrinks its balance sheet dramatically, but that loan growth would be an offset to that. Maybe could you help square those 2 points for us? And I guess just maybe discuss the risk that the pace the Fed has communicated could lead to the higher deposit flight risk?\nBill Demchak: So I mean there are 2 opposing forces, right? So when the Fed shrinks its balance sheet, which it will -- even they let it run off, they're saying whatever that number is $90 million in the month or quarter, I don't ever remember. But it will pull deposits from the system. At the same time, when there is loan growth, it puts deposits back into the system. And the reason for that, if you think about it, is just leverage on the capital. I assume everybody holds 10% on a loan. They borrow from us, they deposit somewhere else. It collectively builds deposits into the system.  Collectively, we think that's going to cause -- will cause deposit growth to slow, but we actually think deposit growth is still going to be positive for the system. And for us, -- so again, Fed balance sheet shrinks, but at the same time, we're going to see loan demand, we expect to see loan demand, we have seen loan demand at a pace that would generate deposits. So we're not particularly worried about that. Now what will happen, of course, is as the Fed gets rates substantially higher, betas are going to have to do a big catch-up move because all of a sudden, it's going to matter. Interest rates are going to get back to a place where people start paying attention again. Now I don't know what that level is. I don't know that we've ever come off of a base of 0 and trying to play catch up. The last time we thought about that, the Fed reversed course pretty quickly. So we're going to have to see how that plays out, but I think deposits in the system will still be there. We just won't see the same growth we have over the last couple of years.\nBill Carcache: Got it. That makes sense. And taking that thought process and going inside your outlook, does that contemplate the possibility of maybe simply letting some of the liquidity that you're sitting on today outflow, if necessary, rather than paying up to keep it -- to fund loan growth?\nBill Demchak: Well, we haven't had to pay up. I mean, as you see, I think our average cost of fund stays basis points. There's some percentage of that on the corporate side, in particular, that will be that looks for direct substitutes from competitors or money market funds on a given day. And we assume -- and in our forecast, we assume that, that will have very high, if not betas of one, and that's fine. That's part of our funding model. It's embedded in our forecast. And we never -- we don't consider those necessarily core deposits, even though they're core clients, if that makes sense to you.\nBill Carcache: Yes. Yes. And If I can ask --\nRob Reilly: And that's 4 basis points on core deposits, yes.\nBill Demchak: Or borrowing is a little higher.\nBill Carcache: Okay. That's helpful. If I could ask on CRE. Can you talk about the risk that tenants may remain good credits and continue to buy by their lease obligations through the end of their lease terms, but ultimately, not renew because they just don't need as much space?\nBill Demchak: Look, I think that's one of our fears. I think we're going to see that weakness in office properties flow through over a longer period of time. But -- and I think, by the way, that's very market-specific. So I would tell you, for example, I think in Pittsburgh here, we're going to struggle with that. Now we don't have exposure. Interestingly, we don't have a lot of exposure here, but practically, I think there'll be less people in the buildings in Pittsburgh, and I think that's going to be the case in many metro areas around the country.  And yes, I think that's going to cause lease rates to drop over time, and yes, I think that's going to impact office properties, but we're reserved for that, have been watching that. We pick our clients carefully, and at this point, we think most, if not all, of them have the wherewithal to make their way through that.\nBill Carcache: That's helpful. If I could squeeze in one last one. Bill, you shared in the past a vision of giving consumers the ability to use Zelle at the point of sale for retail payments. Can you update us on whether that's something that you'd still support? And how do you think about the risk of cannibalizing? Or that, that could cannibalize your debit and credit volumes?\nBill Demchak: Look, I'm not going to speak on behalf of EWS, a company simply because that's a collective decision from the ownership group of of EWS. I think everybody's interest is to make payments easier, to make payments be more fraud-resistant and look, to be able to make some return on payments. We collectively look through all those things against the current rails and as the payment landscape changes, we'll adapt with it. We are going to start using Zelle -- we and a few of the other ownership banks to allow purchase for services and for small business. So it will get out there into the peak merchant space. Just at this point, not a direct competitor to the card rails for a variety of reasons, but not yet.\nOperator:  Our next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Can you guys -- I know you talked about the capital utilization rates going up, possibly customers with capital expenditure, but can you share with us where are they now? And what would you consider to be a normal rate of capital utilization at your organization?\nRob Reilly: Yes, and we've talked about this before, Gerard. Right now, we're in the low 50s, up from the high 40s that we saw through the bulk of last year. And normal -- just whatever normal is, we might expect somewhere in the mid-50s. So we're moving towards that, not there yet.\nGerard Cassidy: And Rob, is there any difference have you discovered yet with the BBVA customer that C&I customer versus a legacy PNC customer?\nRob Reilly: No, it's interesting. On the commercial side, we were talking about that this morning. It's very, very similar in terms of the borrowing trades. So there really is no difference in terms of the utilization of the lines. They're all up in sort of similar amounts.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then I know you mentioned in your remarks about transferring over some of the available for sale securities. I think it was $20 billion into the held to maturity. Would they transfer it over at a discount? And then will that discount accrete into your capital over time?\nRob Reilly: Yes. Yes, exactly.\nGerard Cassidy: And how many discount\u2026\nRob Reilly: And again, it doesn't affect earnings. It's all going to pull. We balance between the flexibility benefit of available for sale versus the AOCI component of -- or a benefit of held to maturity. So we'll continue to look at that, but it's -- it will run its course. And again, it doesn't affect earnings.\nGerard Cassidy: Right. Okay. And just lastly, I know you guys -- when you did the BBVA transaction, you were quite excited about the the money transfer business is between, I believe, it was maybe Mexico and the U.S. Can you share with us any color on how is that going? Is it going as well as you expected? Have you been able to expand it?\nBill Demchak: No, it's -- we've actually been really happy with it. It has expanded, and we're currently looking -- it's through several countries in Latin America today, and we're actually looking at expanding that through relationships into other countries there. And I think into Europe, although I'm not certain about that, it's dependent on correspondent banking relationships in the receiving countries that are responsible for your customer. But no, it's a big business. We actually white label it for others, and we're excited by it. We've been -- it's now mainstream on our consumer apps. And importantly, we're looking at some of that functionality to be tied into some of the things that we're actually doing on the corporate side.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I'll turn the presentation back to the speakers.\nBryan Gill: Okay. Well, thank you very much. And if you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to the IR team.\nBill Demchak : Thanks, everybody.\nRob Reilly : Thanks, folks.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Rob Reilly",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis. During the quarter, loans increased by $2 billion or 1%. Investment securities grew $6 billion or 5%, and Federal Reserve cash balances declined $13 billion or 17%, reflecting higher securities and loan balances as well as lower borrowed funds. Deposit balances averaged $453 billion and were relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. Our tangible book value was $79.68 per common share as of March 31, a 15% decline linked quarter, which was entirely driven by mark-to-market adjustments in our securities and swap portfolios as a result of higher interest rates. As a category 3 institution, we opted out of recognizing AOCI and regulatory capital, and as of March 31, 2022, our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 9.9%. Given our strong capital ratios, we continue to be well positioned with significant capital flexibility. And as Bill just mentioned, our Board recently approved a $0.25 increase to our quarterly cash dividend on common stock, raising the dividend to $1.50 per share. Additionally, during the first quarter, we completed share repurchases of $1.2 billion or 6.4 million shares. Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Average loans increased $2 billion linked quarter, and on a spot basis, loans grew $6 billion, or 2%. PPP loan balances continued to decline and impacted first quarter growth by approximately $2 billion on both an average and spot basis. Looking at loan growth, excluding the impact of PPP loans, average loans increased $4 billion or 1%, driven by $5 billion of growth in commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by a $1 billion decline in commercial real estate balances and average consumer loans were stable linked quarter.  On a spot basis, loans grew $8 billion. Commercial loans grew $7 billion, driven by higher utilization as well as new production within corporate banking and business credit businesses. Notably, in our C&IB segment, the utilization rate increased 85 basis points and our overall commitments were 2% higher compared to year-end 2021. And consumer loans increased $900 million as higher mortgage balances were partially offset by lower auto and credit card loans. Moving to Slide 5. Average deposits of $453 billion remained stable compared to the fourth quarter. On the right, you can see total deposits at period end were $450 billion, a decline of $7 billion or 2% linked quarter. All of the decline was on the commercial side where deposits were $10 billion lower, primarily driven by seasonal cash deployments. Partially offsetting the commercial decline, consumer deposits increased $3 billion, reflecting seasonally higher balances related to tax refund payments. Overall, our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits remained stable at 4 basis points, and importantly, we remain core funded with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 65% at the end of the first quarter. Slide 6 details the change in our average securities and federal reserve balances. We've maintained high levels of liquidity over the past year while opportunistically purchasing securities. This trend continued into the first quarter as we added primarily U.S. treasuries and agency RMBS. As a result, average security balances increased by 5% or $6 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, and now represent 27% of interest-earning assets. Slide 7 highlights the composition of our high-quality securities portfolio as well as the balance changes from year-end March 31. During the first quarter, we added to our portfolio with net purchases of approximately $6 billion. However, the increase in rates during the first quarter resulted in higher net unrealized losses of approximately $6 billion, and accordingly, our period-end balances remained relatively state.  To moderate the impact of rising rates on security values and correspondingly AOCI, we transferred approximately $20 billion of securities from our available-for-sale portfolio and to help maturity at quarter end. Importantly, fluctuations in AOCI did not have an impact on our earnings. However, we are mindful of the AOC impact on tangible book value, and we'll continue to evaluate potential opportunities to further transit. Turning to the income statement on Slide 8. As you can see, first quarter 2022 reported EPS was $3.23, which included pre-tax integration costs of $31 million. Excluding integration costs, adjusted EPS was $3.29. During the first quarter, integration costs reduced revenue by $16 million and increased expenses by $15 million. First quarter revenue was down $435 million or 8% compared with the fourth quarter. Expenses declined $619 million or 16% linked quarter, and excluding the impact of integration expenses, noninterest expense declined 7%. The first quarter provision recapture was $208 million, primarily reflecting the impact of improved COVID-19-related economic conditions, and our effective tax rate was 17%. So in total, net income was $1.4 billion in the first quarter. Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Slide 9 details our revenue trends. Total revenue for the first quarter of $4.7 billion defined $430 million linked quarter. Net interest income of $2.8 billion was down $58 million, or 2%. Higher securities and loan balances as well as increased security yields were more than offset by a $74 million decline in PPP revenue due to loan forgiveness activity and the impact of 2 fewer days in the quarter. And net interest margin of 2.28% was up 1 basis point.  As we recently announced and effective for the first quarter, we recategorized the presentation of our noninterest income and provided an update to the related guidance. Consistent with those revisions, first quarter fee income was $1.7 billion, a decline of $296 million or 15% linked quarter. Looking at the detail of each revenue category. Asset management and brokerage fees decreased $8 million or 2%, reflecting lower average equity markets. Capital markets-related fees declined $208 million or 45%, driven by lower M&A advisory fees mostly due to elevated fourth quarter transaction levels, but also some delayed transaction activity in the first quarter. Card and Cash Management revenue decreased $26 million or 4%, driven by seasonally lower consumer spending activity.  Lending and deposit services was essentially stable linked quarter, declining only $4 million. Residential and commercial mortgage noninterest income was $50 million lower, primarily due to decreased commercial mortgage activity. And finally, other noninterest income declined $81 million, primarily due to lower private equity-related revenue and once again compared to elevated fourth quarter levels. Turning to Slide 10. Our first quarter expenses were down by $619 million or 16%. Excluding the impact of integration expenses, noninterest expense declined $243 million or 7%. The majority of the decline was a lower personnel expense, primarily reflecting the lower incentive compensation. We remain deliberate around our expense management.  At year-end 2021, we achieved our objective to reduce BBVA USA's annual operating expense run rate by $900 million. And as we previously stated, we have a goal to reduce costs by $300 million in 2022 through our continuous improvement program, and we're confident we'll achieve our full year target. As you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business on technology investments. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 11. Nonperforming loans of $2.3 billion decreased $182 million or 7% compared to December 31, and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies were $1.7 billion on March 31, a $286 million decline from year-end, reflecting lower consumer and commercial loan delinquencies. The majority of these decreases resulted from our progress in resolving BBVA USA conversion-related, administrative and operational delays.  Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $137 million, an increase of $13 million linked quarter. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans continues to be historically low at 19 basis points. And during the first quarter, we reduced our allowance for credit losses by approximately $300 million, and our reserves now total $5.2 billion or 1.8% of total loans. In summary, PNC reported a solid first quarter, and we're well positioned for the remainder of 2022 as we continue to realize the potential of our coast-to-coast franchise. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we expect strong growth over the course of 2022, resulting in 3.7% average GDP growth. We also expect the Fed to raise rates by an additional cumulative 175 basis points through the remainder of this year to a range of 2% to 2.25% by year-end, and all of this is consistent with the update in our recent 8-K filing.  Looking at the second quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2022, we expect average loan balances to be up 2% to 3%, which includes a $1.3 billion decline in PPP loans. We expect net interest income to be up 10% to 12%. We expect noninterest income to be up 6% to 8%, which results in total revenue increasing 9% to 11%. We expect total noninterest expense to be up 3% to 5%, and we expect second quarter net charge-offs to be between $125 million and $175 million.  Considering our reported first quarter operating results, second quarter expectations and current economic forecasts for the full year 2022 compared to the full year 2021, we expect average loan growth of approximately 10% and spot loan growth of 5%. We expect total revenue growth to be 9% to 11%. We expect expenses, excluding integration expense, to be at 4% to 6%. And we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions. Yes, sure. John, it's Rob. So in regard to capital markets, you'll recall, at the beginning of the year, our expectations for capital markets was to be down approximately 20% or so from '21 levels just because the '21 levels were so elevated. The first quarter was slower than we expected even at those reduced levels, but for the full year guide, I have most of that back in there. So most of what we expected to occur in the first quarter that didn't occur is still in the full year guidance. So that's why we're still 9% to 11% growth. Yes. Okay. This is Rob again, John. So on the deposits in the quarter, we saw a spot decline and all of that was on the commercial side, which we see as largely seasonal. Consumer deposits on a spot basis were actually up, reflecting tax refunds and some seasonality there. So that's the story on the deposits. So the full year in regard to the betas relative to what we expected at the beginning of the year, we have increased our betas consistent with the increase in the Fed rate hike forecast. Along the lines of what we saw in the last cycle, maybe a little bit less just because we're working off such high levels. Very quiet \u2013 as you pointed out, very quiet on the first 100 basis points or so, but showing up \u2013 if our rate forecast is correct, showing up in the third and fourth quarter. And higher inventory levels, of course, yes. Sure. Sure. So 9 to 11 total for the full year. Compared to the beginning of the year, net interest income is a bigger component of that because of the rate increases and the higher balances. So we're looking at that to be inside of that 9 to 11, the NII and the high teens. And then on the core fee piece, looking more towards flattish to maybe down low single digits, and most of the change there being on the mortgage outlook from the beginning of the year. So most of our fee categories are tracking to what we expected for the full year, including capital markets, as I just mentioned, but mortgage were off from what we thought at the beginning of the year because of rates. So residential and commercial mortgage, we expect it to be down low single digits. We're now looking at maybe down 25% or 30% year-over-year. So that's where the fee change is largely resident. Or another way, you're not spending the money on investments and that's part of the guide. No, no, that's right. The answer is, it is the regulatory capital that we look at, Mike. And the current pace that we've been on, we expect to continue. That average quarter \u2013 the average quarterly pace, we were a little bit more this past quarter. And that's 4 basis points on core deposits, yes. Yes, and we've talked about this before, Gerard. Right now, we're in the low 50s, up from the high 40s that we saw through the bulk of last year. And normal -- just whatever normal is, we might expect somewhere in the mid-50s. So we're moving towards that, not there yet. No, it's interesting. On the commercial side, we were talking about that this morning. It's very, very similar in terms of the borrowing trades. So there really is no difference in terms of the utilization of the lines. They're all up in sort of similar amounts. Yes. Yes, exactly. And again, it doesn't affect earnings. It's all going to pull. We balance between the flexibility benefit of available for sale versus the AOCI component of -- or a benefit of held to maturity. So we'll continue to look at that, but it's -- it will run its course. And again, it doesn't affect earnings. Thanks, folks."

            "name": "Bill Demchak",
            "content": "Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you've seen, we had a solid start to the year as we grew loans and securities, controlled expenses and our credit quality reserves and capital levels remain very strong. As we previously disclosed, noninterest income was below our expectations for the quarter. And while we had expected fees to be down sequentially, reflecting typical first quarter seasonality, the decline actually exceeded normal interest rate volatility and probably, the Russian-Ukraine conflict adversely impacted certain of our capital markets businesses among other areas.  As we look forward, we're clearly in an environment of uncertainty here. We're also in an environment with rising interest rates, which benefit banks with increased loan demand, which benefit banks. And in PNC's case, a business or a bank that never changed its credit box on credit terms got really easy business that has a very -- or a bank that is a very solid mix of fee-based businesses, and importantly, a bank that has substantially expanded its geographic presence. And I want to hit on that in a second just as it relates to our progress on BBVA. And I would tell you, I just -- I couldn't be more proud of what we've been able to accomplish over the last about 15 months in total now, but in particular, over the last couple of quarters. And we still have a lot of work to do, but to put it in perspective, our staffing is largely complete. And our calling effort, particularly versus the fourth quarter, has increased substantially, and our sales and pipelines are robust.  Just to give you an idea of the activity behind this, in the legacy BBVA USA geographies, corporate commercial banking costs have doubled since the fourth quarter, and sales have increased almost 50%. And as we expected across CNIB, nearly half of these sales were actually non-credit related and the BBVA USA geographies.  We switch to the retail side. We're obviously focused on building customer relationships. Just to give you an idea, our sales per branch were approximately 60% higher in March compared to what they were in December with improvements across mortgages, cards and referrals to PNC investments. In our Asset Management group, we're making great progress and strategic investments to hire key people in business development and adviser roles, and importantly, our client opportunity pipelines are really strong. From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to deploy our excess liquidity as you've seen with solid loan growth and securities purchases. Spot loans grew $6 billion in the quarter, driven by the commercial side, which saw a nice increase in utilization. In fact, if we exclude the impact of PPP loan forgiveness, spot commercial loans grew $7 billion. The fastest organic quarterly growth we've seen since the commercial defensive draws that we saw at the start of the pandemic. And by the way, we've seen that growth carry into the early part of April.  We also remain active on the security side with net purchases of almost $6 billion during the quarter. From a balance sheet perspective, the securities were offset by unrealized losses due to rising interest rates, which Rob is going to discuss in a few minutes. This doesn't impact our regulatory capital or earnings, but during the quarter, we moved approximately $20 billion of our securities available for sale to help the maturity to limit future valuation changes due to interest rate movements. Importantly, we saw a solid rebound in the yield on our securities. Overall, we believe we are well positioned for the rising interest rate environment to deliver net interest income growth and NIM expansion throughout the year. And finally, during the quarter, we returned about $1.7 billion of capital to shareholders through share repurchase dividends. And importantly, based on our performance and strong capital levels to the Board's confidence in our execution of our strategic priorities, we recently announced a substantial increase to our quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share to $1.50, or 20%. I just want to close by thanking our employees for their hard work and dedication to our customers and communities. Moving forward, as I said, we believe we are well positioned to continue to grow shareholder value as the economy normalizes stats move higher than we realized the full potential of the combined PNC and BBVA USA franchise. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our results, and then we'll take your questions. I think the utilization is part of \u2013 reflects part of the slowdown on the capital market side in bonds. Clients continue to be active. So yes, some pickup in CapEx build in inventory. The other thing we're seeing beyond the utilization change, I think we saw a similar percentage increase in just new dollars out \u2013 sorry, not percentage, but notional amount increase of new DHE commitments out. So some of its utilization, some of its winning clients, utilization driven by capital markets being a bit of disarray together with increased CapEx. Yes. Thanks for the question, Mike. In short, we don't have to. We've always been investing in our franchise. So if you think about \u2013 we talk about our new markets, as I said in my comments, they are largely staffed at this point. And so if I think about our people spend, we're kind of where we need to be. If I think about our technology spend, we've been going hard at that for a number of years, and we're more in the place of what can we actually get done in a sequence timeline, and we are about, hey, spend more money. So you're not going to see increases against what we expected in that space. So anyway, short answer to the question is, no, we don't need to spend the money, and not spending the money in no way detracts for \u2013from the growth that I think we're capable of. Yes. Another way to put it, yes. No, it's a fair question. I don't know that you were going to define share by share of C&I loans in the market. I think what we have to do, and we're working on, Mike, is presentation of just progress in underpenetrated markets compared to what we execute in one of our mature markets and then tracking that for you. I think that's the best metric. So we look at loan balances. We look at fees. We look at percent of fees as a percentage of total revenues. We look at calling volume. We look at new clients, all the things you'd expect us to, and we need to figure out and I'll commit to you that we will \u2013 we need to put out metrics so you can track it through time. We do it internally. I'm not sure I follow the question. Yes. Yes. Yes. So if you're simply asking the question, do we view our available capital based on the 9 90, the answer to that is, yes. We're going to be in the market. It's obviously \u2013 I think it's more attractive today to buy back shares than it was towards the end of the year. So we're going to be in the market, and I don't know what we probably said. So I mean there are 2 opposing forces, right? So when the Fed shrinks its balance sheet, which it will -- even they let it run off, they're saying whatever that number is $90 million in the month or quarter, I don't ever remember. But it will pull deposits from the system. At the same time, when there is loan growth, it puts deposits back into the system. And the reason for that, if you think about it, is just leverage on the capital. I assume everybody holds 10% on a loan. They borrow from us, they deposit somewhere else. It collectively builds deposits into the system.  Collectively, we think that's going to cause -- will cause deposit growth to slow, but we actually think deposit growth is still going to be positive for the system. And for us, -- so again, Fed balance sheet shrinks, but at the same time, we're going to see loan demand, we expect to see loan demand, we have seen loan demand at a pace that would generate deposits. So we're not particularly worried about that. Now what will happen, of course, is as the Fed gets rates substantially higher, betas are going to have to do a big catch-up move because all of a sudden, it's going to matter. Interest rates are going to get back to a place where people start paying attention again. Now I don't know what that level is. I don't know that we've ever come off of a base of 0 and trying to play catch up. The last time we thought about that, the Fed reversed course pretty quickly. So we're going to have to see how that plays out, but I think deposits in the system will still be there. We just won't see the same growth we have over the last couple of years. Well, we haven't had to pay up. I mean, as you see, I think our average cost of fund stays basis points. There's some percentage of that on the corporate side, in particular, that will be that looks for direct substitutes from competitors or money market funds on a given day. And we assume -- and in our forecast, we assume that, that will have very high, if not betas of one, and that's fine. That's part of our funding model. It's embedded in our forecast. And we never -- we don't consider those necessarily core deposits, even though they're core clients, if that makes sense to you. Or borrowing is a little higher. Look, I think that's one of our fears. I think we're going to see that weakness in office properties flow through over a longer period of time. But -- and I think, by the way, that's very market-specific. So I would tell you, for example, I think in Pittsburgh here, we're going to struggle with that. Now we don't have exposure. Interestingly, we don't have a lot of exposure here, but practically, I think there'll be less people in the buildings in Pittsburgh, and I think that's going to be the case in many metro areas around the country.  And yes, I think that's going to cause lease rates to drop over time, and yes, I think that's going to impact office properties, but we're reserved for that, have been watching that. We pick our clients carefully, and at this point, we think most, if not all, of them have the wherewithal to make their way through that. Look, I'm not going to speak on behalf of EWS, a company simply because that's a collective decision from the ownership group of of EWS. I think everybody's interest is to make payments easier, to make payments be more fraud-resistant and look, to be able to make some return on payments. We collectively look through all those things against the current rails and as the payment landscape changes, we'll adapt with it. We are going to start using Zelle -- we and a few of the other ownership banks to allow purchase for services and for small business. So it will get out there into the peak merchant space. Just at this point, not a direct competitor to the card rails for a variety of reasons, but not yet. No, it's -- we've actually been really happy with it. It has expanded, and we're currently looking -- it's through several countries in Latin America today, and we're actually looking at expanding that through relationships into other countries there. And I think into Europe, although I'm not certain about that, it's dependent on correspondent banking relationships in the receiving countries that are responsible for your customer. But no, it's a big business. We actually white label it for others, and we're excited by it. We've been -- it's now mainstream on our consumer apps. And importantly, we're looking at some of that functionality to be tied into some of the things that we're actually doing on the corporate side. Thanks, everybody."

        "content": "Bryan Gill: Good morning. And welcome to today's conference call for The PNC Financial Services Group. I am Bryan Gill, the Director of Investor Relations for PNC. And participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO.  Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information, as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures, are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of January 16, 2023 and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.  Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Demchak: Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. During a challenging and volatile operating environment for the banking industry, PNC performed well during 2023 and delivered a solid finish in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2023, adjusting for the fourth quarter impact of the FDIC special assessment and expenses related to a staff reduction initiative that we completed in the fourth quarter, we earned $14.10 per diluted share compared to $13.85 per diluted share in 2022. Throughout the year and amidst all the disruption, we continue to grow our customer base and deepen relationships across our coast-to-coast franchise. Importantly, we generated record revenue and controlled core expenses, which allowed us to deliver a modest amount of positive adjusted operating leverage. For the fourth quarter, we reported $883 million in net income or $1.85 diluted per share and $3.16 per share on an adjusted basis. Rob is going to take you through the financials in a moment, but I'd like to highlight a few points. First, as we announced in early October, we closed on the acquisition of the capital commitment loans from Signature, which is immediately accretive to earnings. Secondly, as we expected, we saw meaningful growth from non-interest income during the fourth quarter, driven primarily by a rebound in capital markets and advisory fees. Third, we completed the actions to reduce our workforce and we are positioned to realize $325 million of expense savings in 2024. This is in addition to our CIP savings target for 2024 that Rob will discuss in a few minutes. Expense discipline remains a top priority for us and accordingly we are targeting stable expenses for 2024 even as we continue to invest in key growth initiatives. Fourth, our credit quality remained strong during the quarter, reflecting our thoughtful approach us to growing our balance sheet. While we continue to expect credit charge offs to increase over time, particularly in the CRE office segment, we\u2019re adequately reserved. Finally, during the fourth quarter, we increased our capital position, saw solid improvement in our AOCI intangible book value and repurchased a modest amount of shares. In summary, we run our company with a focus on delivering through the cycle performance and feel very good about our strategy, our capabilities and the strength of our balance sheet as we enter 2024. And we believe we are well positioned to drive growth and deliver shareholder value in the coming year and beyond. As always, I want to thank our employees for everything they do to meet the needs of our customers and make our success possible.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob.\nRob Reilly: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis and compared to the third quarter. Loans were up 2% and averaged $325 billion, which includes the acquired Signature capital commitment loans. Investment securities declined $2 billion or 2%. Cash balances at the Federal Reserve increased $4 billion to $42 billion and deposits increased $1.4 billion and averaged $424 billion. Borrowed funds increased $5 billion to $73 billion, driven by higher FHLB borrowings and parent company senior debt issuances. At year end, P&C was fully compliant with the proposed holding company long term debt requirements. And we expect to reach compliance with the bank level metrics through our normal course of funding well in advance of the phase in period. AOCI improved $2.6 billion to negative $7.7 billion at quarter end, primarily reflecting the impact of favorable interest rate movements during the quarter. Accordingly, tangible book value increased to $85.08 per common share, up 9% linked quarter and 18% compared to the same period a year ago. We remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.9% as of December 31st, which increased 10 basis points linked quarter. Our estimated fully phased in expanded risk based CET1 ratio based on the new proposed capital rules would be approximately 8.2% at year end, which is well above our current requirement of 7%. We continue to be well positioned with capital flexibility. During the quarter, we resumed modest share repurchase activity of approximately $100 million or roughly 0.5 million. And when combined with $600 million of common dividends, we returned a total of $700 million of capital to shareholders. Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Compared to the third quarter, average loan balances increased 2%, driven by higher commercial loan balances and modest growth in consumer. Commercial loans were $223 billion, an increase of $5 billion, driven by the acquisition of the Signature capital commitment portfolio. Excluding the $8 billion full quarter average impact from the Signature loan portfolio, commercial loans declined $3 billion or 1%, driven by lower utilization and soft loan demand.  Consumer loans grew approximately $130 million driven by higher residential mortgage balances, partially offset by lower home equity and credit card balances. And loan yields increased 19 basis points to 5.94% in the fourth quarter.  Slide 5 covers our deposits in more detail. Average deposits grew $1.4 billion to $424 billion during the quarter as seasonal growth in commercial deposits was partially offset by a decline in consumer deposits. In regard to mix, consolidated non-interest bearing deposits were 25% in the fourth quarter, down slightly from 26% in the third quarter and consistent with our expectations. We continue to expect the non-interest bearing portion of our deposits to stabilize near current levels. Our current rate paid on interest bearing deposits increased to 2.48% during the fourth quarter, up from 2.26% in the prior quarter. As of December 31st, our cumulative deposit beta was 44% and in line with our expectation for the quarter. As we stated previously, we expect betas to drift modestly higher, while interest rates remain at current level. And our current forecast calls for the first rate cut to occur in mid-2024, at which point, we believe the rate paid on deposits will begin to decline. Slide 6 details our investment security and swap portfolios. Average investment securities of $137 billion decreased 2% as curtailed purchase activity was more than offset by portfolio pay downs and maturities. The securities portfolio yield increased two basis points to 2.59%, reflecting the runoff of lower yielding securities. As of December 31st, the duration of the investment securities portfolio was 4.1 years. Our received fixed swaps pointing to the commercial loan book totaled $33 billion on December 31st. The weighted-average received fixed rate of our swap portfolio increased three basis points to 2.1% and the duration of the portfolio was 2.3 years. AOCI improved by $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower interest rates. Importantly, as lower rate securities and swaps roll-off, we expect a continued meaningful improvement to tangible book value from AOCI accretion. Turning to the income statement on Slide 7. Fourth quarter net income was $883 million or $1.85 per share, which included pre-tax non-core expenses of $665 million or $525 million after tax related to the FDIC special assessment and the workforce reduction charges incurred in the fourth quarter. Excluding non-core expenses, adjusted EPS was $3.16. Total revenue of $5.4 billion increased $128 million or 2% compared to the third quarter of 2023. Net interest income declined modestly by $15 million. And our net interest margin was 2.66%, a decline of five basis points.  Non-interest income increased to $143 million, or 8%. Non-interest expense of $4.1 billion increased $829 million or 26% and included $665 million of non-core expenses. Core non-interest expense was $3.4 billion and increased $164 million or 5%. Provision was $232 million in the fourth quarter and our effective tax rate was 16.3%. Full year 2023 revenue grew 2% compared to 2022. Core non-interest expense was well controlled and grew 1%. Importantly, our disciplined expense management and CIP savings allowed us to deliver modest positive operating leverage and PPNR growth of 2% on an adjusted basis. Turning to Slide 8, we highlight our revenue trends. Fourth quarter revenue was up $128 million, or 2% compared with the third quarter, driven by strong fee income as net interest income of $3.4 billion was down modestly. Fee income was $1.8 billion and increased $99 million or 6% linked quarter. Looking at the detail, capital markets and advisory fees rebounded as expected and increased $141 million, or 84%, driven by higher M&A advisory fees. Asset Management and Brokerage revenue grew $12 million or 3%, reflecting favorable market conditions. And residential and commercial mortgage revenue declined $52 million or 26%, primarily due to a decrease in the valuation of net mortgage servicing rights. Other non-interest income of $138 million increased $44 million or 47% and included favorable valuation adjustments and gains on sales. The fourth quarter also included a $100 million negative Visa fair value adjustment compared to a $51 million negative adjustment in the third quarter. As a reminder, at December 31st, PNC owned 3.5 million Visa Class B shares with an unrecognized gain of approximately $1.5 billion. Turning to Slide 9, our fourth quarter non-interest expense of $4.1 billion was up $829 million and included $665 million of non-core charges. Core non-interest expense of $3.4 billion increased to $164 million, or 5% linked quarter, reflecting higher business activity, seasonality and asset [impairments]. During the quarter, we incurred $42 million of impairment charges, which were largely related to building write-offs. Notably, in 2023, we reduced our non-branch footprint by 2 million square feet, or approximately 17%. For the full year, core non-interest expense of $13.3 billion increased $177 million or 1%. Expense growth was well controlled due in part to the $50 million midyear increase in our CIP goal to $450 million, which we exceeded. As a result, we generated 41 basis points of adjusted positive operating leverage for the full year. Looking forward to 2024, our annual CIP target is $425 million. This program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments. And as of year-end, we completed actions related to the workforce reduction that will drive $325 million of cost savings in 2024.  Taken together, we're implementing $750 million of expense management actions, all of which are reflected in our 2024 guidance that I will cover in a few minutes. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 10. While overall credit quality remained strong across our portfolio, we did see a slight uptick in NPLs and delinquencies. Non-performing loans increased $57 million or 3% linked quarter and included a $12 million increase in CRE. Total delinquencies of $1.4 billion increased $97 million, or 8% linked quarter. The increase included seasonally higher consumer delinquencies, the majority of which have already been resolved. Net loan charge offs were $200 and in the fourth quarter and came in at the low end of our expectations. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans ratio was 24 basis points. And our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.5 billion or 1.7% of total loans on December 31st, stable with September 30th. The CRE office portfolio is where we continue to see the most stress and fourth quarter's net loan charge offs were $56 million. We continue to expect future losses on this portfolio. However, we believe we've adequately reserved for those potential losses. As of December 31st, our reserves on the office portfolio were 8.7% of total office loans and inside of that 12.9% on the multi tenant portfolio. Importantly, our overall CRE office portfolio declined 6% or approximately $550 million linked quarter, reflecting a higher level of payoff. Criticized office loans were flat and nonperforming loans increased 2% linked quarter. Naturally, we'll continue to monitor and review our assumptions to ensure they reflect current market conditions. And a full update of this portfolio is included in the appendix slides. In summary, PNC reported a solid fourth quarter and full year 2023. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we're expecting a mild recession starting in mid-2024 with a contraction in real GDP of less than 1%. We expect the federal funds rate to remain unchanged between 5.25% and 5.5% through mid-2024 when we expect the fed to begin to cut rates. We expect a reduction of 75 basis points in 2024 with a 25 basis point decrease in July, November and December. Looking ahead, our outlook for full year 2024 compared to 2023 results is as follows. We expect spot loan growth of 3% to 4%, which equates to average loan growth of approximately 1%. Total revenue to be stable to down 2%. Inside of that, our expectation is for net interest income to be down in the range of 4% to 5% and non-interest income to be up 4% to 6%, core non-interest expenses to be stable and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18.5%. Our outlook for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 is as follows. We expect average loans to be stable, net interest income to be down 2% to 3%, fee income to be down 6% to 8% due to seasonally lower first quarter client activity as well as elevated fourth quarter capital markets and advisory levels. Other noninterest income to be in the range of $150 million and $200 million excluding Visa activity. Taking the component pieces of revenue together, we expect total revenue to be down 3% to 4%. We expect total core noninterest expense to be down 3% to 4%. We expect first quarter net charge offs to be between $200 million and $250 million.  And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research.\nJohn McDonald: I wanted to ask, Rob and Bill, about the loan growth outlook for 2024, the spot guidance of up 3% to 4% seems a bit better than what we're seeing in H8 currently? And I thought you could give some color on the drivers of your outlook there.\nRob Reilly: On the outlook, so average loans up 1%, spot 3% to 4%, as you mentioned. We see most of that being on the commercial side and most of that being on the back end of the year. Consumer, we do have some growth throughout the year but pretty modest.\nJohn McDonald: And Rob, on the net interest income guidance, it sounds like you're assuming three rate cuts, a little bit less than what the forward curve has. Just kind of wondering what would be the sensitivity if the forward curve played out and we saw more rate cuts than what you're assuming. Is that helpful to the NII outlook, all else equal or relatively neutral? Could you update us on the sensitivity there, please?\nRob Reilly: Yes, the short answer is it's relatively neutral because, as you know, we've worked hard to get our balance sheet into a neutral sensitivity position. So not a lot of variance in terms of the forwards and our own expectations in terms of the impact on NII. The big question, obviously, is going to be on deposit pricing and how that behaves as the year plays out, but we don't expect a lot of variance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore.\nJohn Pancari: On the capital markets revenue, the numbers certainly came in really solid this quarter. As you look into 2024 and in the context of your up 4% to 6% non-interest income guidance for the full year. How are you thinking about capital markets trajectory through the year off of this level?\nRob Reilly: So with capital markets, we did get the rebound that we were expecting in the fourth quarter and the bulk of that is in our Harris Williams, our M&A advisory business. As far as '24 guidance goes, we expect -- the pipelines are good. We expect sort of the fourth quarter and the first quarter of '23 to be the range of what we would see on a quarterly basis going through in 2024. The anomalies were the soft quarters of Q2 and Q3 in 2023. So take a look at the first quarter of '23, the fourth quarter of '23, and that's the range of what we would expect the quarterly run rate to be through '24.\nJohn Pancari: All right, thanks for that. And then separately\u2026\nRob Reilly: I'll even help you, it's up about 20% year-over-year. I'll save you the math there.\nJohn Pancari: And then on the -- your guidance for 2024 implies about 100 basis points negative operating leverage using the midpoint of the guidance, which actually screens relatively well versus your peers. How sustainable is that if the rate environment does not pan out as you're modeling and -- or better put, if your revenue outlook is worse. Do you think you can sustain at that expected negative 100 basis points operating leverage or could it be worse?\nBill Demchak: Look, we're fairly neutral to the -- for our NII forecast toward as a function of rate cuts or not. So the outcome ought to be the same.\nRob Reilly: Well, I would add to that, John. So we worked hard. We took some actions to position ourselves to have stable expenses year-over-year. So that's a lot. And then as Bill pointed out on the revenue side, the NII is fairly predictable on a relative basis outside of rates and the fees, we feel good about the guidance. So that's what we think is going to occur.\nBill Demchak: I think if there's variance anywhere, it's going to be on our assumptions as it relates to deposit betas, the continued shift to interest bearing versus non-interest bearing and ultimately, the steepness of the yield curve, the rates at the long end of the curve as opposed to the front end of the curve. We've tried to be to the best of our ability a little bit on the conservative side of all of those things and we feel pretty good about where our forecast is.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.\nScott Siefers: I was hoping you might be able to share just some updated thoughts on sort of where and when NII might bottom and I think perhaps more importantly, magnitude of rebound that it might see thereafter. I know you sort of suggested last month that NII ultimately could be a record in 2025. I guess I'd just be curious for any updated context around your thoughts there.\nBill Demchak: So as we pointed out, we do see NII going down in the first half of the year, troughing around the time of the cuts and then growing from there and beyond. So think about where we are now, go down on a bit and then grow back to where we are now. And then in '25 what gives us a lot of confidence around record NII is we will get the compounded effect of the repricing of our fixed rate assets as that continues into '25. So that's what we laid out a month ago and that's still what we think.\nScott Siefers: And then I guess just on the notion of deposit pricing, it sounds like you're expecting deposit cost to ease right around the time the Fed starts cutting. What's your sense for the sort of the pace of deposit betas on the way down vis-a-vis what they were on the way up?\nRob Reilly: Well, I would say on the commercial and the high net worth side fast, and then we talked about on the consumer, sort of the core consumer, we could -- and this is what Bill was alluding to there earlier, we could continue to see some drift up in rate paid even though we get some cuts. So that's a big variable, obviously, and we'll have to play it out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley.\nManan Gosalia: Thanks for outlining the macro assumptions behind the outlook, and I appreciate your comments on loan growth being more back end loaded. But can you give us some more color on how you're thinking about it? Because you also mentioned a mild recession midyear. So is it really a big uptick in CNI, maybe like 4Q as rates begin to come down and as we come out of that mild recession? So I was hoping you could give us some more color on both commercial and consumer there.\nRob Reilly: So I would just say just to follow up on that. So yes, back half of the year. On the commercial side, we see the uptick in the third and the fourth quarter. A big part of that being expected increase in utilization, which is a little bit lower right now and then just some pickup in general economic activity, not a lot, 3% to 4% spot to average up 1%. And then on the consumer, just sort of slow, steady growth, nothing big there, maybe a little bit more in card and auto and a little bit less in resi.\nManan Gosalia: And then just on the credit side, last quarter you had some CRE loans move from criticized into NPLs. And it looks like things have been pretty steady this quarter on both criticized and NPLs. So do you think at this stage you guys have scrubbed the books and it should remain steady over the next few quarters with just NCOs ticking up or is it likely to be lumpy? The question is more, given the new outlook for rates to come down, do you think the worst is behind us?\nBill Demchak: Well, not on charge-offs. We think we're reserved correctly. But you have to remember that as these loans go to NPL and eventually if we have charges against them, we'll charge them off. It won't run through P&L because we've already created a reserve for it, but the work set on actually maturing the loans and dealing with the outcome is yet to come.\nRob Reilly: And I would just add to that the key number to look at there is the criticized percentage, which has not changed much. To Bill's point, that's the first bucket. The the movement of that to nonperforming or charge-offs will occur, but it's that criticized number that's the key number.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Can you guys share with us -- you talked, Rob, about the commercial loan growth in the quarter when you ex out the Signature purchase was down slightly. I know you have prospects for growth here in 2024, as you pointed out. But can you share with us, do you guys see much competition from the private credit market, the private equity guys that have been much more aggressive recently in lending? And second, on part of that, you have them as customers as well, so do you have to balance them as competitors as well as customers?\nBill Demchak: We don't compete with them head-to-head with the types of loans that are typically -- and because we don't play that that much in the unsecured leverage space. Most of the decline at Signature we saw was in utilization. As we go forward, more and more of the lending markets are moving into private hands and longer term that is of a concern if they kind of move up scale in what they do. We do serve them. I would say that our client base, just call it, private equity or private managers at large, they're probably our largest clients between what we do with and for them from Harris Williams and Solebury and business credit and treasury management with their portfolio companies and on and on and on. So they are good clients. And I guess, at the margin, we could end up competing with them in certain things.\nRob Reilly: But not so much today.\nBill Demchak: Yes.\nGerard Cassidy: And then, Rob, the follow-up with your comments and you gave us the Visa ownership and the unrealized gain. If I recall correctly, I think first quarter of '24 the owners of those shares are permitted to monetize that. Can you give us your updated thoughts on what you guys are thinking with your position in Visa?\nRob Reilly: So our position is, we have $1.5 billion in unrealized gains, 3.5 million b-shares. As you pointed out, there's a vote by the Visa shareholders at the end of this month to approve an action to enable the b-holders to monetize maybe up to 50%. So we don't control that. We see when the vote is scheduled, should it be approved, then we'll move forward with our monetization plans that would be allowed under whatever is approved.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.\nBill Carcache: Following up on credit, if we play out what the soft landing scenario could look like and the Fed starts cutting rates in mid-24, would you expect to be in a position to possibly start releasing reserves? Or are there sort of likely to still be late cycle concerns that would lead you to want to maintain the reserve levels that you've already established?\nRob Reilly: So first, our reserves are appropriate for what we expect to occur. So that's number one. Number two, if things should substantially improve yes, sure. We're running at 1.7% right now, which historically is on the high side. So if things normalize out in your definition of normal, we could be lower.\nBill Carcache: And then, Bill, following up on your comment about feeling good about your reserve levels, but that we haven't necessarily seen peak charge-off rates yet. If we were to go down the mild recession scenario path, should we expect there to be some lag between when those charge-offs would actually hit the P&L and when the corresponding reserves would get released, or would the releases kind of occur concurrent with the increase in charge-offs?\nBill Demchak: So remember, the charge-offs don't hit P&L. There seems to be a lot of confusion on that. The provisions we take hit P&L. And we've provided for our best expectation of future charge-offs in a scenario that assumes a mild recession. So if our scenario comes true, we're fully reserved for everything that might happen to us. Charge-offs will flow through but not hit our P&L because they're effectively neutralized against the debit to the provision.\nBill Carcache: Understood\u2026\nRob Reilly: That's worth pointing out\u2026\nBill Demchak: There always seems to be some confusion on that, but does that make sense?\nBill Carcache: No, I understand. I guess where I was going with that is that some have sort of alluded to you allowing as -- if the credit environment does indeed deteriorate, allowing some of those losses to flow through without necessarily releasing reserves. And so even though they've established reserves, they would kind of maintain those reserves and allow the higher charge-offs to flow through before before ultimately releasing. And I was just hoping to get your thoughts on kind of the timing of those different pieces.\nBill Demchak: So it's a mechanical calculation that's dependent on our view of the economy at the time. So if you got to a place where the charge-offs occur and somehow we thought the economy was worse than our current expectation, we would be providing for the remainder of the portfolio at a higher level than we are today, but right now we don't expect that to happen. So if the economy is worse, simply put, if the economy is worse than a mild recession, then you would expect our total reserve to increase.\nRob Reilly: Because it's forward-looking per CECL\u2026\nBill Carcache: If I could squeeze in one last one on capital return. I appreciate Slide 19. Can you speak to how you're thinking about that 150 basis point impact from Basel III endgame in light of some of the pushback that it's received? And is that 8.2% a level you feel comfortable running at or would you target a slightly higher buffer? And then sort of underlying all of that, are you thinking -- how are you thinking about buybacks in light of all the moving pieces?\nBill Demchak: We'll answer the easy question first. 8.2 would be too low, I think, in this new environment, assuming Basel III endgame goes so we'd run some higher number than that for certain. There does appear to be substantial commentary on the proposal such that I would expect that if it isn't reproposed, there still would be some relief in certain asset categories and risk weighted assets and maybe on operating risk capital, we'll see. Having said that, we don't know. So at the moment, what we know is we're going to continue to grow earnings. We're going to accrete AOCI back into our capital base and we're going to pull that 8.2% up. We think we have flexibility inside of that to be active in the share repurchase market between now and then and the more certainty we have, the more certain will be and explicit on what we might buy back during a given period of time.\nRob Reilly: And I would just add to that. You saw we did -- we bought just under $100 million of -- share repurchases in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, we would expect to do at least that, maybe a little bit more depending on market indications.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS.\nErika Najarian: I just wanted to ask one follow-up question on NII, if I may. A lot of investors were really excited about the graphic that you put together at Goldman, the Nike Swoosh, if you will, that had sort of the first rate cut embedded under the Nike Swoosh 25 basis points in 3Q '24. And I completely understand this is abstract in a way. But I just wanted to put together everything that you guys said I think it surprises investors that when you overlay the forward curve that it is neutral to this outcome, at least for '24. But just looking back at the slides, Rob, and on Slide 6 of this earnings season, it does seem like a lot of your receipts fixed swaps don't really meaningfully mature until 4Q '24. So I guess, in terms of like the mechanical repricing that you keep talking about, the way to really ask this question is, it sounds like it is possible to have potentially a lower trough than people expected in '24 and still have that record net interest income in '25 because of those fixed rate dynamics, and who knows what can happen on the liability side and the deposit repricing side, if the Fed cuts sooner. But it feels like that swap maturity is part of why that Nike Swoosh could be steeper. Am I thinking about it the right way?\nBill Demchak: I don't know that we expect it to be deeper. We purposely drew the line to be a little bit thick because we don't know exactly when that trough might occur. I think all of the commentary on '25 is in some ways, mechanical. We're simply taking our fixed rate assets and replacing them at market and we know what the maturities of those assets are. So in short form, one of the reasons we highlight that and also show the steepness of the curve is our balance sheet, the fixed rate assets on our balance sheet are shorter than virtually all of our peers and at a yield level that is somewhat lower. So we have a big pickup in fixed rate earning yields sooner than I think the market expects, which is in turn what gives rise to the slope of that curve, whether it troughs in the second quarter or the first week in the third quarter or the fourth week and -- who knows\u2026\nErika Najarian: I don't think it's the perfect timing though that investors are worried about in terms of second quarter and third quarter. It's just that your new guidance would imply sort of after the first quarter that your average NII would be like 3%, 3.7% or something like that, right? So to get to a record net interest income, it would have to be a pretty significant progression from there. So that's sort of -- I'm trying to set the stage for you guys to build that bridge, because I think that investors really believe that you can reach that?\nBill Demchak: I think that, that if you want to call it the Swoosh, I think the Swoosh is still accurate, I think. So I\u2019d say -- what else to say, it's consistent with our guidance and it's still accurate.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: Just a follow-up on that swaps book on Page 6 of the deck, couple of billion dollar decline in the receive fixed. Any changes this quarter, whether terminations or new adds? And any thoughts in terms of like how you change and utilize that in terms of last answer of trying to move that forward?\nBill Demchak: I don't know that we had changes this quarter\u2026\nRob Reilly: Going into Q1 '24. Is that the question, Ken?\nKen Usdin: No, just did you terminate any swaps this quarter and add any new, and just kind of to remind us of the understanding of what's still yet to go after with the\u2026\nRob Reilly: Yes, we terminated some, we added some net down. But that's all in the normal course.\nBill Demchak: I mean I think we're missing your question. What are you trying to get at?\nKen Usdin: Yes, I was just trying to get at just what changes you've made inside of the portfolio outside of the normal maturity schedule, which I think we see in disclosures quarterly. Just wondering did you terminate swaps, did you add some new ones and then just remind us about the way forward\u2026\nBill Demchak: We terminated 3.6 and added some. And just to remind you, when you terminate you basically lock in a loss to the life of the original contract and we'll do that at times simply to reposition where we have exposure.\nKen Usdin: Second question, just on the fee outlook. Good to see, first of all, in the fourth quarter, the capital markets improvement that you saw. Just wondering how much of a driver is that of your expected fee growth next year, your pipelines in Harris Williams, et cetera? And what other pieces do you expect to see growth in this year?\nRob Reilly: Ken, just as I said earlier, on the capital markets, a nice rebound in our Harris Williams activity. Pipelines are good, they support year-over-year growth of close to 20%, which is what I mentioned earlier. In terms of the other fee categories, asset management flattish up a bit, that will be market dependent. Card and cash management up low to mid-single digits. Lending and deposit services that will be down mid-single digits, and that's reflective of anticipated lower service charges on deposits. There was a number of items that we did in '23 to reduce overdraft charges for our clients, so that's good for our clients, but that will be some lower fees, about mid-single digit down. And then mortgage outside of hedge gains, flattish, down if you include the hedge gains.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Bill, December 5th, your [earnings] words. I quote skill matters today more than it ever has prior to March and the mini crisis. We knew the technology mattered. We knew scale and brand mattered. We just eliminated tailoring and regulation for all intents and purposes, et cetera, et cetera. You just go on to say that this will never be reversed. Scale is more important than ever. I could give the whole speech, but it was -- it seemed like a passioned speech, more than I've ever heard you say before. So why now? And along those lines, I mean, if you had better scale when you get positive operating leverage in 2024 with a chance you could do that, but I think you're talking further out. I think you're talking about organic and maybe inorganic expansion, but help me out there, if you could.\nBill Demchak: No, I was. Look, if you just look back at what happened this year on top of kind of eight or nine years of history post the financial crisis. We've seen, your words Goliath win, in terms of organic deposit share growth. That trend line has accelerated as a function of the mini crisis in March, where corporates bluntly don't necessarily trust the regulatory environment to ensure that their deposits at a bank are safe. And so we've seen those deposits flow uphill. And if you aren't a primary relationship with that corporate deeply embedded with treasury management and other services you net-net lose corporate deposits. I think when you combine that with the cost of technology, the removal of some of the tiering and regulation and capital requirements and liquidity, scale matters. I think we are -- on net benefited from the mini crisis, but just barely. And I think below us, people struggle with that conversation with corporate clients. Above us, perhaps it's easy but I think we need to move into that next level such that we are seen coast-to-coast is a ubiquitous standard brand with the quasi support that the giant banks have in terms of times of crisis. I think it's critical.\nMike Mayo: So what does that mean -- okay, so you've identified the need and desire. So what does that mean, does it mean\u2026\nBill Demchak: So naturally, over time, we are gaining share on our newer markets at a rapid pace. And we see that client acquisition and growth in all forms from deposits to loans to fees to so forth. I think through time, you're going to see a clear differentiation of this dynamic played out across the market. But I think there's going to be banks that are looking for strong partners, and I think we are a strong partner. I'm not going to force that issue. But I think longer term, we are a natural player in the consolidation of an industry where scale matters.\nMike Mayo: And if you can't get the deals done and you've been opportunistic with National City and et cetera, since then. Organic ubiquity, how can you get there? Do we start seeing you advertise during the Super Bowl, do you double or triple your marketing spend? What do you do then?\nBill Demchak: You just have to execute. I mean there's a -- which simplifies the process. If you think about what's happening in the banking industry today, there's a couple or some other issues with the large banks. But on the deposit share side, there's a couple of clear winners. There's one that probably should be over time. There's some people neutral and there's people losing. There's 5,000 banks in the country that I can take from and grow, right? That's just a longer period of time, which we will pursue than what we might see if there's inorganic opportunities when people come to the realization that they're kind of riding something down in a deteriorating franchise. I can see the trends. I know how we would react to opportunities and the trends. I know what we'll do to execute on our own, and I'm confident in that. But I\u2019ll go all the way back, scale matters. We're going to have to play that\u2026\nMike Mayo: Just one follow-up. I got several e-mails from people saying, well, I don't know if I want to own PNC stock because I'm afraid of what kind of deal they might do. What do you say to that?\nBill Demchak: I think they should look at our history is my simplest explanation. I think somebody asked that question once before, and I assure everybody, I still don't want to do math and I think the opportunities will come our way. I don't think we'll have to chase them. One of the reasons people say why am I as vocal about this as I am. And part of the reason is to make the public aware, the public being regulators, politicians, boards of other banks aware of what's happening in the banking industry and the need for consolidation. It doesn't mean I'm going to do something stupid in the pursuit of it. I just think it's going to happen.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess just maybe one to follow up on your discussion with Mike around M&A. I guess do you think the regulatory backdrop today is conducive for doing M&A or do we need a very different sort of DoJ just philosophical approach towards larger bank deals before we could see a pickup in deal activity?\nBill Demchak: I don't think there's a simple answer to that, because I think if you listen carefully to the various speeches that have been done that they'll talk about the recognition of the need for M&A, but they'll also talk about good mergers and bad mergers, good outcomes and bad outcomes along several metrics. So put differently, I think certain deals will get approved and others wouldn't. I think we have proven as an acquirer that we know what we're doing and that the result in institution is, in fact, stronger than the one we might acquire.\nEbrahim Poonawala: And I guess just taking a step back around your view around the mild recession. I'm just wondering how much of that is just theoretical informing your reserving model versus the weakness that you are seeing across your customers and that leads you to believe that we will have a recession in the middle of the year. Because once we go down that path, who knows how bad things could get. So I just would love to hear whether the recession assumption is just your conservatism or are you seeing weakness across your customers?\nBill Demchak: It's not -- I mean you see the credit metrics, it's not a concern in terms of customers. We've seen with the margin -- profit margins decrease with certain clients. If you look at soft inputs, surveys and so forth that are coming out of the Fed districts, the economy is definitely weakening, not at a alarming pace. It's kind of what we had expected given how tight the Fed has gotten with monetary policy. So we kind of see a mild recession. We actually see employment remaining strong through that, which ultimately is the thing that keeps the economy from going deeply into recession, just the strength of the labor market and consumer spending. So this is kind of following the path of what we thought for some period of time now.\nEbrahim Poonawala: And one quick follow-up -- yes, go ahead.\nRob Reilly: I was just going to add to that to Bill. So I mean, we can have a slowdown continue and technically hit a recession without adding a whole lot of credit risk or increased credit structure.\nEbrahim Poonawala: And just one thing, Rob, you mentioned that you expect non-interest bearing deposits to stabilize from here. Just playing devil's advocate, why should they stabilize from here? If rates remain if we are in a 3% plus Fed funds world, should we not expect the mix of deposits to move towards interest-bearing, towards more CDs, or is your view different?\nRob Reilly: Well, I think, obviously, we've been watching that for the better part of the year here in terms of the decline in non-interest bearing in absolute terms and relative percentages. Why we think it's largely happened is because it's been so long. And much of that base is our businesses and individuals that run on non-interest bearing deposits. So they're not necessarily shopping for a higher rate. There's something around the institution in terms of they pay for their services through deposits or on the consumer side, small transaction accounts.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor: Just wondering your thoughts on kind of medium term loan growth, a bit of a bigger picture question. You obviously gave details for this year. But as you think out like the next couple of years, are you in the camp that there needs to be some structural deleveraging. So loan growth might be below GDP or where normally it would be or just any thoughts that you have on that?\nBill Demchak: I mean, I don't think there's going to be any structural delevering here. We're obviously seeing a lot of banks kind of on my prior point, coming to the conclusion that some of the ancillary lending activities they took on, on the back of the big stimulus, don't make sense anymore. So there's deleveraging maybe across the industry by certain groups, but not here.\nMatt O'Connor: And I guess I meant from customers, right? Look, even if rates go down a little bit, they're still structurally a lot higher than they've been for the last almost 15 years. So if you just think about like the lending demand that's out there, obviously, there's lots of factors. But just thoughts on if higher rates structurally have a meaningful impact on that?\nBill Demchak: On loan growth?\nMatt O'Connor: Correct. Right, as you think about corporate borrowers, right, they just can't afford potentially to borrow as much with rates higher. Obviously, the same for consumer mortgage is the most obvious. So thinking more like on the commercial side.\nBill Demchak: Well, I think at the end of the day, our generic corporate client needs to redo their facilities and the price has gone up and that will occur. I think some of the activity that we saw on the back of just really low cost of capital in the private equity markets where it kind of leverages free, that's going to go by the wayside at a higher rate environment. But if you look at the composition of our book, we're kind of the bread and butter of America. So I wouldn't expect that we would necessarily see a decline in loan growth simply because the front end of the -- [SOFR] rate is higher.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Rochester with Compass Point.\nDave Rochester: Just back on the M&A discussion, I know you mentioned building in a bigger buffer than that 8.2% you have on your adjusted CET1 ratio today. But is the plan to also maybe retain more capital than you normally would to better position you for taking advantage of any inorganic opportunities, which might keep the buyback activity more muted this year? Just curious to get your thoughts there, how you might balance that.\nBill Demchak: Well, there -- I mean both of those thoughts are consistent. 8.2 is too low, so we're going to grow. Whether we're growing to be in faster compliance or growing because maybe something shows up where we could use some, we're still going to grow and it's going to mute our capital return below it and otherwise might be absent the Basel III endgame changes.\nDave Rochester: So you would expect buyback activity maybe to remain muted for the rest of the year, not just the first quarter?\nBill Demchak: There's too much up in the air. I mean, it's depending what the Fed does, look, they could have to repropose that. It could go through the elections, they could change it materially. We don't know, right? All we know is all else equal, 8.2 is probably too low. We're still burning through our AOCI, we don't think that's going to change. So we stay the course and we'll adapt based on what we learn.\nDave Rochester: And then back on your deposit betas you're assuming in the guide, are you thinking you can move those commercial rates down materially more like right out of the gate with the first cut, or are you baking in some sort of a lag at least for the first couple of cuts?\nBill Demchak: It'd be pretty fast.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. We do have a question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Just a follow-up on your commercial loan growth, like why you're punching your weight in the growth rate, and which areas of commercial loan growth? And I know you've deployed teams to all these cities near the Nashville Main Street Bank and you're trying to gain share and all that. Is it that effort the market share by city, is it kind of smaller middle market, is it that effect you talked about scale versus the smaller competitors? I mean how much we put in each bucket as far as your delta versus peer when it comes to commercial loan growth?\nBill Demchak: Look, I would tell you that we're winning more than we're losing on pitches, and that's more true today than it was pre-March. We're winning at a higher percentage just because there's more shots on goal in the new markets than we are in the old markets. So the growth there is higher, and that's -- those new markets and the fact that we have them fully staffed, including products might differentiates us in a world where total loan growth may be somewhat tepid. And importantly, we've said this for years as we go into new markets, we are not leading with credit in these new markets. Fee based growth actually outpaces our loan based growth in those markets as we cross sell into TM and other products and services. So we look at pipelines, we look at line of sight into what we have in each market. I don't know that there's any particular product that stands out as something that's growing faster than another one. It's just we're winning clients.\nMike Mayo: Last follow-up. How much faster would your commercial loan growth be if there were no private capital competitors right now?\nBill Demchak: I think the only way that impacts us directly -- I mean that the margin may be something in business credit and as you know, we partner with a lot of the private credit guys inside of that business. And then to the extent companies are taken private, which I think is going to slow down given the cost of capital, we sometimes will lose a client to a leverage lender because they were taken private,but that's kind of\u2026\nRob Reilly: A structure we [Multiple Speakers] that's it right, that would be the margin. If that wasn't available that would otherwise be a conventional loan.\nOperator: And we have a question from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.\nVivek Juneja: Bill, question for you. I mean when -- your deposits at the Fed keeps growing, at what point are you thinking about putting some of that or locking some of the yields on that? What's your thinking there, especially given all your other commentary about rates peaking, mild recession, loan growth, et cetera, triangulating all of those factors?\nBill Demchak: Well, in the near term, we think the market's got ahead of itself. I think until we're clear of the outcome here we\u2019re clear. Inflation and Fed actions, we're happy to kind of stay neutral. I think my own expectation here, Vivek, is notwithstanding what the Fed does through the course of '24 with the Fed funds rate. My expectation is you're not going to see a lot of action in the longer rate simply because of the supply calendar and the fact that inflation will have a tail and while the Fed could ease somewhat, I think inflation is still going to be running against versus their goal. We'll have a lot of issues. So long story short, we don't see a burning desire to put money to work here because we think that opportunity is going to remain and the durations we typically invest in, and probably get a little bit better just given how hot the market got post the last Fed meeting.\nVivek Juneja: And second one, you talked about a lot of companies going into private hands and obviously, that creating competition from private credit for loans. But on the other hand, you've got increasing capital requirements, so which is translating into higher spreads, so as to maintain returns. How do you balance that out, on the one hand, not losing share to the private market and on the other hand, maintaining that? Do you see -- given that, do you see spreads staying high or do you think that turns course the other way?\nBill Demchak: So again, we're kind of talking about two different universes of credit. But having said that, and I'm sure you've heard this inside of your own shop. Lending money for the sake of lending money doesn't give us an adequate return on capital. Didn't before, it doesn't now. What gives us a return on capital is the relationship, the annuity-like fees you get from TM, the additive fees you get from capital markets related activity, and price is kind of a third order effect on the return on capital we get with that client relationship. Private credit at the moment sees a return in private credit because they could put some leverage on it, and there's not a big opportunity in private equity and yields are high. And I'll chase that for a period of time. I don't know that, that's a particularly great investment through the cycle and we don't try to compete with it in that lending environment.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time.\nBryan Gill: Well, thank you very much for participating in the call. And if you have any follow-ups, feel free to reach out to the IR team. Thank you, and good luck this quarter.\nBill Demchak: Thanks, everybody.\nRob Reilly: Thank you.\nOperator: That does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line. Have a great day, everyone.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rob Reilly",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis and compared to the third quarter. Loans were up 2% and averaged $325 billion, which includes the acquired Signature capital commitment loans. Investment securities declined $2 billion or 2%. Cash balances at the Federal Reserve increased $4 billion to $42 billion and deposits increased $1.4 billion and averaged $424 billion. Borrowed funds increased $5 billion to $73 billion, driven by higher FHLB borrowings and parent company senior debt issuances. At year end, P&C was fully compliant with the proposed holding company long term debt requirements. And we expect to reach compliance with the bank level metrics through our normal course of funding well in advance of the phase in period. AOCI improved $2.6 billion to negative $7.7 billion at quarter end, primarily reflecting the impact of favorable interest rate movements during the quarter. Accordingly, tangible book value increased to $85.08 per common share, up 9% linked quarter and 18% compared to the same period a year ago. We remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.9% as of December 31st, which increased 10 basis points linked quarter. Our estimated fully phased in expanded risk based CET1 ratio based on the new proposed capital rules would be approximately 8.2% at year end, which is well above our current requirement of 7%. We continue to be well positioned with capital flexibility. During the quarter, we resumed modest share repurchase activity of approximately $100 million or roughly 0.5 million. And when combined with $600 million of common dividends, we returned a total of $700 million of capital to shareholders. Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Compared to the third quarter, average loan balances increased 2%, driven by higher commercial loan balances and modest growth in consumer. Commercial loans were $223 billion, an increase of $5 billion, driven by the acquisition of the Signature capital commitment portfolio. Excluding the $8 billion full quarter average impact from the Signature loan portfolio, commercial loans declined $3 billion or 1%, driven by lower utilization and soft loan demand.  Consumer loans grew approximately $130 million driven by higher residential mortgage balances, partially offset by lower home equity and credit card balances. And loan yields increased 19 basis points to 5.94% in the fourth quarter.  Slide 5 covers our deposits in more detail. Average deposits grew $1.4 billion to $424 billion during the quarter as seasonal growth in commercial deposits was partially offset by a decline in consumer deposits. In regard to mix, consolidated non-interest bearing deposits were 25% in the fourth quarter, down slightly from 26% in the third quarter and consistent with our expectations. We continue to expect the non-interest bearing portion of our deposits to stabilize near current levels. Our current rate paid on interest bearing deposits increased to 2.48% during the fourth quarter, up from 2.26% in the prior quarter. As of December 31st, our cumulative deposit beta was 44% and in line with our expectation for the quarter. As we stated previously, we expect betas to drift modestly higher, while interest rates remain at current level. And our current forecast calls for the first rate cut to occur in mid-2024, at which point, we believe the rate paid on deposits will begin to decline. Slide 6 details our investment security and swap portfolios. Average investment securities of $137 billion decreased 2% as curtailed purchase activity was more than offset by portfolio pay downs and maturities. The securities portfolio yield increased two basis points to 2.59%, reflecting the runoff of lower yielding securities. As of December 31st, the duration of the investment securities portfolio was 4.1 years. Our received fixed swaps pointing to the commercial loan book totaled $33 billion on December 31st. The weighted-average received fixed rate of our swap portfolio increased three basis points to 2.1% and the duration of the portfolio was 2.3 years. AOCI improved by $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower interest rates. Importantly, as lower rate securities and swaps roll-off, we expect a continued meaningful improvement to tangible book value from AOCI accretion. Turning to the income statement on Slide 7. Fourth quarter net income was $883 million or $1.85 per share, which included pre-tax non-core expenses of $665 million or $525 million after tax related to the FDIC special assessment and the workforce reduction charges incurred in the fourth quarter. Excluding non-core expenses, adjusted EPS was $3.16. Total revenue of $5.4 billion increased $128 million or 2% compared to the third quarter of 2023. Net interest income declined modestly by $15 million. And our net interest margin was 2.66%, a decline of five basis points.  Non-interest income increased to $143 million, or 8%. Non-interest expense of $4.1 billion increased $829 million or 26% and included $665 million of non-core expenses. Core non-interest expense was $3.4 billion and increased $164 million or 5%. Provision was $232 million in the fourth quarter and our effective tax rate was 16.3%. Full year 2023 revenue grew 2% compared to 2022. Core non-interest expense was well controlled and grew 1%. Importantly, our disciplined expense management and CIP savings allowed us to deliver modest positive operating leverage and PPNR growth of 2% on an adjusted basis. Turning to Slide 8, we highlight our revenue trends. Fourth quarter revenue was up $128 million, or 2% compared with the third quarter, driven by strong fee income as net interest income of $3.4 billion was down modestly. Fee income was $1.8 billion and increased $99 million or 6% linked quarter. Looking at the detail, capital markets and advisory fees rebounded as expected and increased $141 million, or 84%, driven by higher M&A advisory fees. Asset Management and Brokerage revenue grew $12 million or 3%, reflecting favorable market conditions. And residential and commercial mortgage revenue declined $52 million or 26%, primarily due to a decrease in the valuation of net mortgage servicing rights. Other non-interest income of $138 million increased $44 million or 47% and included favorable valuation adjustments and gains on sales. The fourth quarter also included a $100 million negative Visa fair value adjustment compared to a $51 million negative adjustment in the third quarter. As a reminder, at December 31st, PNC owned 3.5 million Visa Class B shares with an unrecognized gain of approximately $1.5 billion. Turning to Slide 9, our fourth quarter non-interest expense of $4.1 billion was up $829 million and included $665 million of non-core charges. Core non-interest expense of $3.4 billion increased to $164 million, or 5% linked quarter, reflecting higher business activity, seasonality and asset [impairments]. During the quarter, we incurred $42 million of impairment charges, which were largely related to building write-offs. Notably, in 2023, we reduced our non-branch footprint by 2 million square feet, or approximately 17%. For the full year, core non-interest expense of $13.3 billion increased $177 million or 1%. Expense growth was well controlled due in part to the $50 million midyear increase in our CIP goal to $450 million, which we exceeded. As a result, we generated 41 basis points of adjusted positive operating leverage for the full year. Looking forward to 2024, our annual CIP target is $425 million. This program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments. And as of year-end, we completed actions related to the workforce reduction that will drive $325 million of cost savings in 2024.  Taken together, we're implementing $750 million of expense management actions, all of which are reflected in our 2024 guidance that I will cover in a few minutes. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 10. While overall credit quality remained strong across our portfolio, we did see a slight uptick in NPLs and delinquencies. Non-performing loans increased $57 million or 3% linked quarter and included a $12 million increase in CRE. Total delinquencies of $1.4 billion increased $97 million, or 8% linked quarter. The increase included seasonally higher consumer delinquencies, the majority of which have already been resolved. Net loan charge offs were $200 and in the fourth quarter and came in at the low end of our expectations. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans ratio was 24 basis points. And our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.5 billion or 1.7% of total loans on December 31st, stable with September 30th. The CRE office portfolio is where we continue to see the most stress and fourth quarter's net loan charge offs were $56 million. We continue to expect future losses on this portfolio. However, we believe we've adequately reserved for those potential losses. As of December 31st, our reserves on the office portfolio were 8.7% of total office loans and inside of that 12.9% on the multi tenant portfolio. Importantly, our overall CRE office portfolio declined 6% or approximately $550 million linked quarter, reflecting a higher level of payoff. Criticized office loans were flat and nonperforming loans increased 2% linked quarter. Naturally, we'll continue to monitor and review our assumptions to ensure they reflect current market conditions. And a full update of this portfolio is included in the appendix slides. In summary, PNC reported a solid fourth quarter and full year 2023. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we're expecting a mild recession starting in mid-2024 with a contraction in real GDP of less than 1%. We expect the federal funds rate to remain unchanged between 5.25% and 5.5% through mid-2024 when we expect the fed to begin to cut rates. We expect a reduction of 75 basis points in 2024 with a 25 basis point decrease in July, November and December. Looking ahead, our outlook for full year 2024 compared to 2023 results is as follows. We expect spot loan growth of 3% to 4%, which equates to average loan growth of approximately 1%. Total revenue to be stable to down 2%. Inside of that, our expectation is for net interest income to be down in the range of 4% to 5% and non-interest income to be up 4% to 6%, core non-interest expenses to be stable and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18.5%. Our outlook for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 is as follows. We expect average loans to be stable, net interest income to be down 2% to 3%, fee income to be down 6% to 8% due to seasonally lower first quarter client activity as well as elevated fourth quarter capital markets and advisory levels. Other noninterest income to be in the range of $150 million and $200 million excluding Visa activity. Taking the component pieces of revenue together, we expect total revenue to be down 3% to 4%. We expect total core noninterest expense to be down 3% to 4%. We expect first quarter net charge offs to be between $200 million and $250 million.  And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions. On the outlook, so average loans up 1%, spot 3% to 4%, as you mentioned. We see most of that being on the commercial side and most of that being on the back end of the year. Consumer, we do have some growth throughout the year but pretty modest. Yes, the short answer is it's relatively neutral because, as you know, we've worked hard to get our balance sheet into a neutral sensitivity position. So not a lot of variance in terms of the forwards and our own expectations in terms of the impact on NII. The big question, obviously, is going to be on deposit pricing and how that behaves as the year plays out, but we don't expect a lot of variance. So with capital markets, we did get the rebound that we were expecting in the fourth quarter and the bulk of that is in our Harris Williams, our M&A advisory business. As far as '24 guidance goes, we expect -- the pipelines are good. We expect sort of the fourth quarter and the first quarter of '23 to be the range of what we would see on a quarterly basis going through in 2024. The anomalies were the soft quarters of Q2 and Q3 in 2023. So take a look at the first quarter of '23, the fourth quarter of '23, and that's the range of what we would expect the quarterly run rate to be through '24. I'll even help you, it's up about 20% year-over-year. I'll save you the math there. Well, I would add to that, John. So we worked hard. We took some actions to position ourselves to have stable expenses year-over-year. So that's a lot. And then as Bill pointed out on the revenue side, the NII is fairly predictable on a relative basis outside of rates and the fees, we feel good about the guidance. So that's what we think is going to occur. Well, I would say on the commercial and the high net worth side fast, and then we talked about on the consumer, sort of the core consumer, we could -- and this is what Bill was alluding to there earlier, we could continue to see some drift up in rate paid even though we get some cuts. So that's a big variable, obviously, and we'll have to play it out. So I would just say just to follow up on that. So yes, back half of the year. On the commercial side, we see the uptick in the third and the fourth quarter. A big part of that being expected increase in utilization, which is a little bit lower right now and then just some pickup in general economic activity, not a lot, 3% to 4% spot to average up 1%. And then on the consumer, just sort of slow, steady growth, nothing big there, maybe a little bit more in card and auto and a little bit less in resi. And I would just add to that the key number to look at there is the criticized percentage, which has not changed much. To Bill's point, that's the first bucket. The the movement of that to nonperforming or charge-offs will occur, but it's that criticized number that's the key number. But not so much today. So our position is, we have $1.5 billion in unrealized gains, 3.5 million b-shares. As you pointed out, there's a vote by the Visa shareholders at the end of this month to approve an action to enable the b-holders to monetize maybe up to 50%. So we don't control that. We see when the vote is scheduled, should it be approved, then we'll move forward with our monetization plans that would be allowed under whatever is approved. So first, our reserves are appropriate for what we expect to occur. So that's number one. Number two, if things should substantially improve yes, sure. We're running at 1.7% right now, which historically is on the high side. So if things normalize out in your definition of normal, we could be lower. That's worth pointing out... Because it's forward-looking per CECL... And I would just add to that. You saw we did -- we bought just under $100 million of -- share repurchases in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, we would expect to do at least that, maybe a little bit more depending on market indications. Going into Q1 '24. Is that the question, Ken? Yes, we terminated some, we added some net down. But that's all in the normal course. Ken, just as I said earlier, on the capital markets, a nice rebound in our Harris Williams activity. Pipelines are good, they support year-over-year growth of close to 20%, which is what I mentioned earlier. In terms of the other fee categories, asset management flattish up a bit, that will be market dependent. Card and cash management up low to mid-single digits. Lending and deposit services that will be down mid-single digits, and that's reflective of anticipated lower service charges on deposits. There was a number of items that we did in '23 to reduce overdraft charges for our clients, so that's good for our clients, but that will be some lower fees, about mid-single digit down. And then mortgage outside of hedge gains, flattish, down if you include the hedge gains. I was just going to add to that to Bill. So I mean, we can have a slowdown continue and technically hit a recession without adding a whole lot of credit risk or increased credit structure. Well, I think, obviously, we've been watching that for the better part of the year here in terms of the decline in non-interest bearing in absolute terms and relative percentages. Why we think it's largely happened is because it's been so long. And much of that base is our businesses and individuals that run on non-interest bearing deposits. So they're not necessarily shopping for a higher rate. There's something around the institution in terms of they pay for their services through deposits or on the consumer side, small transaction accounts. A structure we [Multiple Speakers] that's it right, that would be the margin. If that wasn't available that would otherwise be a conventional loan. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. During a challenging and volatile operating environment for the banking industry, PNC performed well during 2023 and delivered a solid finish in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2023, adjusting for the fourth quarter impact of the FDIC special assessment and expenses related to a staff reduction initiative that we completed in the fourth quarter, we earned $14.10 per diluted share compared to $13.85 per diluted share in 2022. Throughout the year and amidst all the disruption, we continue to grow our customer base and deepen relationships across our coast-to-coast franchise. Importantly, we generated record revenue and controlled core expenses, which allowed us to deliver a modest amount of positive adjusted operating leverage. For the fourth quarter, we reported $883 million in net income or $1.85 diluted per share and $3.16 per share on an adjusted basis. Rob is going to take you through the financials in a moment, but I'd like to highlight a few points. First, as we announced in early October, we closed on the acquisition of the capital commitment loans from Signature, which is immediately accretive to earnings. Secondly, as we expected, we saw meaningful growth from non-interest income during the fourth quarter, driven primarily by a rebound in capital markets and advisory fees. Third, we completed the actions to reduce our workforce and we are positioned to realize $325 million of expense savings in 2024. This is in addition to our CIP savings target for 2024 that Rob will discuss in a few minutes. Expense discipline remains a top priority for us and accordingly we are targeting stable expenses for 2024 even as we continue to invest in key growth initiatives. Fourth, our credit quality remained strong during the quarter, reflecting our thoughtful approach us to growing our balance sheet. While we continue to expect credit charge offs to increase over time, particularly in the CRE office segment, we're adequately reserved. Finally, during the fourth quarter, we increased our capital position, saw solid improvement in our AOCI intangible book value and repurchased a modest amount of shares. In summary, we run our company with a focus on delivering through the cycle performance and feel very good about our strategy, our capabilities and the strength of our balance sheet as we enter 2024. And we believe we are well positioned to drive growth and deliver shareholder value in the coming year and beyond. As always, I want to thank our employees for everything they do to meet the needs of our customers and make our success possible.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Look, we're fairly neutral to the -- for our NII forecast toward as a function of rate cuts or not. So the outcome ought to be the same. I think if there's variance anywhere, it's going to be on our assumptions as it relates to deposit betas, the continued shift to interest bearing versus non-interest bearing and ultimately, the steepness of the yield curve, the rates at the long end of the curve as opposed to the front end of the curve. We've tried to be to the best of our ability a little bit on the conservative side of all of those things and we feel pretty good about where our forecast is. So as we pointed out, we do see NII going down in the first half of the year, troughing around the time of the cuts and then growing from there and beyond. So think about where we are now, go down on a bit and then grow back to where we are now. And then in '25 what gives us a lot of confidence around record NII is we will get the compounded effect of the repricing of our fixed rate assets as that continues into '25. So that's what we laid out a month ago and that's still what we think. Well, not on charge-offs. We think we're reserved correctly. But you have to remember that as these loans go to NPL and eventually if we have charges against them, we'll charge them off. It won't run through P&L because we've already created a reserve for it, but the work set on actually maturing the loans and dealing with the outcome is yet to come. We don't compete with them head-to-head with the types of loans that are typically -- and because we don't play that that much in the unsecured leverage space. Most of the decline at Signature we saw was in utilization. As we go forward, more and more of the lending markets are moving into private hands and longer term that is of a concern if they kind of move up scale in what they do. We do serve them. I would say that our client base, just call it, private equity or private managers at large, they're probably our largest clients between what we do with and for them from Harris Williams and Solebury and business credit and treasury management with their portfolio companies and on and on and on. So they are good clients. And I guess, at the margin, we could end up competing with them in certain things. Yes. So remember, the charge-offs don't hit P&L. There seems to be a lot of confusion on that. The provisions we take hit P&L. And we've provided for our best expectation of future charge-offs in a scenario that assumes a mild recession. So if our scenario comes true, we're fully reserved for everything that might happen to us. Charge-offs will flow through but not hit our P&L because they're effectively neutralized against the debit to the provision. There always seems to be some confusion on that, but does that make sense? So it's a mechanical calculation that's dependent on our view of the economy at the time. So if you got to a place where the charge-offs occur and somehow we thought the economy was worse than our current expectation, we would be providing for the remainder of the portfolio at a higher level than we are today, but right now we don't expect that to happen. So if the economy is worse, simply put, if the economy is worse than a mild recession, then you would expect our total reserve to increase. We'll answer the easy question first. 8.2 would be too low, I think, in this new environment, assuming Basel III endgame goes so we'd run some higher number than that for certain. There does appear to be substantial commentary on the proposal such that I would expect that if it isn't reproposed, there still would be some relief in certain asset categories and risk weighted assets and maybe on operating risk capital, we'll see. Having said that, we don't know. So at the moment, what we know is we're going to continue to grow earnings. We're going to accrete AOCI back into our capital base and we're going to pull that 8.2% up. We think we have flexibility inside of that to be active in the share repurchase market between now and then and the more certainty we have, the more certain will be and explicit on what we might buy back during a given period of time. I don't know that we expect it to be deeper. We purposely drew the line to be a little bit thick because we don't know exactly when that trough might occur. I think all of the commentary on '25 is in some ways, mechanical. We're simply taking our fixed rate assets and replacing them at market and we know what the maturities of those assets are. So in short form, one of the reasons we highlight that and also show the steepness of the curve is our balance sheet, the fixed rate assets on our balance sheet are shorter than virtually all of our peers and at a yield level that is somewhat lower. So we have a big pickup in fixed rate earning yields sooner than I think the market expects, which is in turn what gives rise to the slope of that curve, whether it troughs in the second quarter or the first week in the third quarter or the fourth week and -- who knows... I think that, that if you want to call it the Swoosh, I think the Swoosh is still accurate, I think. So I'd say -- what else to say, it's consistent with our guidance and it's still accurate. I don't know that we had changes this quarter... I mean I think we're missing your question. What are you trying to get at? We terminated 3.6 and added some. And just to remind you, when you terminate you basically lock in a loss to the life of the original contract and we'll do that at times simply to reposition where we have exposure. No, I was. Look, if you just look back at what happened this year on top of kind of eight or nine years of history post the financial crisis. We've seen, your words Goliath win, in terms of organic deposit share growth. That trend line has accelerated as a function of the mini crisis in March, where corporates bluntly don't necessarily trust the regulatory environment to ensure that their deposits at a bank are safe. And so we've seen those deposits flow uphill. And if you aren't a primary relationship with that corporate deeply embedded with treasury management and other services you net-net lose corporate deposits. I think when you combine that with the cost of technology, the removal of some of the tiering and regulation and capital requirements and liquidity, scale matters. I think we are -- on net benefited from the mini crisis, but just barely. And I think below us, people struggle with that conversation with corporate clients. Above us, perhaps it's easy but I think we need to move into that next level such that we are seen coast-to-coast is a ubiquitous standard brand with the quasi support that the giant banks have in terms of times of crisis. I think it's critical. So naturally, over time, we are gaining share on our newer markets at a rapid pace. And we see that client acquisition and growth in all forms from deposits to loans to fees to so forth. I think through time, you're going to see a clear differentiation of this dynamic played out across the market. But I think there's going to be banks that are looking for strong partners, and I think we are a strong partner. I'm not going to force that issue. But I think longer term, we are a natural player in the consolidation of an industry where scale matters. You just have to execute. I mean there's a -- which simplifies the process. If you think about what's happening in the banking industry today, there's a couple or some other issues with the large banks. But on the deposit share side, there's a couple of clear winners. There's one that probably should be over time. There's some people neutral and there's people losing. There's 5,000 banks in the country that I can take from and grow, right? That's just a longer period of time, which we will pursue than what we might see if there's inorganic opportunities when people come to the realization that they're kind of riding something down in a deteriorating franchise. I can see the trends. I know how we would react to opportunities and the trends. I know what we'll do to execute on our own, and I'm confident in that. But I'll go all the way back, scale matters. We're going to have to play that... I think they should look at our history is my simplest explanation. I think somebody asked that question once before, and I assure everybody, I still don't want to do math and I think the opportunities will come our way. I don't think we'll have to chase them. One of the reasons people say why am I as vocal about this as I am. And part of the reason is to make the public aware, the public being regulators, politicians, boards of other banks aware of what's happening in the banking industry and the need for consolidation. It doesn't mean I'm going to do something stupid in the pursuit of it. I just think it's going to happen. I don't think there's a simple answer to that, because I think if you listen carefully to the various speeches that have been done that they'll talk about the recognition of the need for M&A, but they'll also talk about good mergers and bad mergers, good outcomes and bad outcomes along several metrics. So put differently, I think certain deals will get approved and others wouldn't. I think we have proven as an acquirer that we know what we're doing and that the result in institution is, in fact, stronger than the one we might acquire. It's not -- I mean you see the credit metrics, it's not a concern in terms of customers. We've seen with the margin -- profit margins decrease with certain clients. If you look at soft inputs, surveys and so forth that are coming out of the Fed districts, the economy is definitely weakening, not at a alarming pace. It's kind of what we had expected given how tight the Fed has gotten with monetary policy. So we kind of see a mild recession. We actually see employment remaining strong through that, which ultimately is the thing that keeps the economy from going deeply into recession, just the strength of the labor market and consumer spending. So this is kind of following the path of what we thought for some period of time now. I mean, I don't think there's going to be any structural delevering here. We're obviously seeing a lot of banks kind of on my prior point, coming to the conclusion that some of the ancillary lending activities they took on, on the back of the big stimulus, don't make sense anymore. So there's deleveraging maybe across the industry by certain groups, but not here. On loan growth? Well, I think at the end of the day, our generic corporate client needs to redo their facilities and the price has gone up and that will occur. I think some of the activity that we saw on the back of just really low cost of capital in the private equity markets where it kind of leverages free, that's going to go by the wayside at a higher rate environment. But if you look at the composition of our book, we're kind of the bread and butter of America. So I wouldn't expect that we would necessarily see a decline in loan growth simply because the front end of the -- [SOFR] rate is higher. Well, there -- I mean both of those thoughts are consistent. 8.2 is too low, so we're going to grow. Whether we're growing to be in faster compliance or growing because maybe something shows up where we could use some, we're still going to grow and it's going to mute our capital return below it and otherwise might be absent the Basel III endgame changes. There's too much up in the air. I mean, it's depending what the Fed does, look, they could have to repropose that. It could go through the elections, they could change it materially. We don't know, right? All we know is all else equal, 8.2 is probably too low. We're still burning through our AOCI, we don't think that's going to change. So we stay the course and we'll adapt based on what we learn. It'd be pretty fast. Look, I would tell you that we're winning more than we're losing on pitches, and that's more true today than it was pre-March. We're winning at a higher percentage just because there's more shots on goal in the new markets than we are in the old markets. So the growth there is higher, and that's -- those new markets and the fact that we have them fully staffed, including products might differentiates us in a world where total loan growth may be somewhat tepid. And importantly, we've said this for years as we go into new markets, we are not leading with credit in these new markets. Fee based growth actually outpaces our loan based growth in those markets as we cross sell into TM and other products and services. So we look at pipelines, we look at line of sight into what we have in each market. I don't know that there's any particular product that stands out as something that's growing faster than another one. It's just we're winning clients. I think the only way that impacts us directly -- I mean that the margin may be something in business credit and as you know, we partner with a lot of the private credit guys inside of that business. And then to the extent companies are taken private, which I think is going to slow down given the cost of capital, we sometimes will lose a client to a leverage lender because they were taken private,but that's kind of... Well, in the near term, we think the market's got ahead of itself. I think until we're clear of the outcome here we're clear. Inflation and Fed actions, we're happy to kind of stay neutral. I think my own expectation here, Vivek, is notwithstanding what the Fed does through the course of '24 with the Fed funds rate. My expectation is you're not going to see a lot of action in the longer rate simply because of the supply calendar and the fact that inflation will have a tail and while the Fed could ease somewhat, I think inflation is still going to be running against versus their goal. We'll have a lot of issues. So long story short, we don't see a burning desire to put money to work here because we think that opportunity is going to remain and the durations we typically invest in, and probably get a little bit better just given how hot the market got post the last Fed meeting. So again, we're kind of talking about two different universes of credit. But having said that, and I'm sure you've heard this inside of your own shop. Lending money for the sake of lending money doesn't give us an adequate return on capital. Didn't before, it doesn't now. What gives us a return on capital is the relationship, the annuity-like fees you get from TM, the additive fees you get from capital markets related activity, and price is kind of a third order effect on the return on capital we get with that client relationship. Private credit at the moment sees a return in private credit because they could put some leverage on it, and there's not a big opportunity in private equity and yields are high. And I'll chase that for a period of time. I don't know that, that's a particularly great investment through the cycle and we don't try to compete with it in that lending environment. Thanks, everybody."

And participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak, and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information, as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures, are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of October 13, 2023, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Demchak: Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. As you can see on the slide, we delivered strong results in the third quarter, generating $1.6 billion in net income, or $3.60 in diluted earnings per share. Rob is going to take you through the numbers in a moment, but I'd like to touch on a few highlights. First, in a challenging operating environment, we generated 3 points of positive operating leverage through disciplined expense management. Our credit quality remained strong during the quarter, reflecting our thoughtful approach to managing risk, customer selection, and long-term relationship development, all of which have historically served us well in challenging economic cycles. Next, we strengthened our capital and liquidity positions even further during the quarter. While we continue to monitor discussions regarding regulatory changes in these areas, based on our current estimates, we are well positioned to meet the proposed requirements without meaningful changes to how we operate. We continue to execute on our key strategic priorities, including our expansion market efforts in upgrading our digital capabilities. And we leveraged our strong balance sheet to take advantage of opportunities such as the Signature Bank loans that we recently acquired. Finally, we are focused on expense management, particularly in the current environment, and have taken actions to maintain disciplined expense control. We increased our Continuous Improvement goal last quarter from $400 million to $450 million, and we are on track to achieve that goal in 2023. Looking ahead, we expect to have CIP savings within a similar range for 2024. And as a reminder, we used savings from this program to fund investments in key growth markets and technology. In addition, earlier this month, we began executing on staff reductions, which will reduce our 2024 expenses by $325 million and will fall to the bottom-line. All told, we are implementing more than $725 million of expense management actions that will have impact on 2024. While decisions involving personnel are never easy, we believe they will help us more effectively and efficiently deliver for our customers and our stakeholders, and we'll continue to be diligent in our expense management going forward. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob.\nRob Reilly: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis and comparing to the second quarter. Loans were down 2% and averaged $320 billion. Investment securities declined $1 billion or 1%. Cash balances at the Federal Reserve increased $7 billion to $38 billion. Deposits of $423 billion declined $3 billion or 1%. Borrowed funds increased $2 billion, primarily due to senior debt issuances near the end of the second quarter. At quarter-end, AOCI was a negative $10.3 billion compared to a negative $9.5 billion at June 30, reflecting higher interest rates. However, tangible book value increased to $78.16 per common share as retained earnings growth exceeded the negative impact of AOCI. Common dividends in the quarter totaled approximately $600 million. And we remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.8% as of September 30, 2023, which increased 30 basis points linked quarter. Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Third quarter loans averaged $320 billion and increased $6.5 billion or 2% compared to the same period a year ago, reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans. Compared to the second quarter, average loan balances declined 2% as growth in consumer was more than offset by a decline in commercial. Consumer loans grew approximately $500 million, reflecting higher residential mortgage and credit card balances. Commercial loans averaged $218 billion, a decline of $5.5 billion, driven by lower utilization as well as paydowns outpacing new production. Loan yields increased 18 basis points to 5.75% in the third quarter, predominantly driven by the higher rate environment. Slide 5 covers our deposits in more detail. Average deposits decreased $3 billion, or 1%, due to a decline in consumer deposits that was somewhat offset by a growth in commercial deposits. In regard to mix, consolidated noninterest-bearing deposits were 26% in the third quarter, down slightly from 27% in the second quarter, and consistent with our expectations. And we still expect the noninterest-bearing portion of our deposits to stabilize in the mid-20% range. Commercial noninterest-bearing deposits represented 42% of total commercial deposits in the third quarter compared to 45% in the second quarter. And our consumer deposit noninterest-bearing mix remains stable at 10%. Our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 2.26% during the third quarter, up from 1.96% in the prior quarter. And as of September 30, our cumulative deposit beta was 41%, which was slightly better than our July expectation. Slide 6 details our investment security and swap portfolios. Average investment securities of $140 billion decreased $1 billion, or 1%, as curtailed purchase activity was more than offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities. The securities portfolio yield increased 5 basis points to 2.57%, reflecting new purchase yields of 5.5% and the runoff of lower-yielding securities. As of September 30, the duration of investment securities portfolio was 4.2 years. Our received fixed swaps pointed to the commercial loan book totaled $35 billion on September 30. The weighted average received fixed rate of our swap portfolio increased 34 basis points to 2.07% and the duration of the portfolio was 2.4 years as of September 30. Accumulated other comprehensive loss increased by approximately $800 million in the third quarter as a negative impact of higher rates more than offset paydowns and maturities during the quarter. Importantly, as lower rate securities and swaps roll off, we expect our securities yield to continue to increase, resulting in a meaningful improvement to tangible book value from AOCI accretion. Turning to the income statement on Slide 7. For the first nine months of 2023, revenue grew 5% compared to the same period a year ago, reflecting higher interest rates and business growth. Noninterest expense grew 2% and was well controlled despite a higher FDIC assessment rate and inflationary pressures. As a result, we generated 3% positive operating leverage, and PPNR grew 9%. For the third quarter, net income was $1.6 billion, or $3.60 per share. Total revenue of $5.2 billion decreased $60 million, or 1%, compared to the second quarter of 2023. Net interest income declined $92 million, or 3%. And our net interest margin was 2.71%, a decline of 8 basis points. Noninterest income increased $32 million, or 2%, as higher fee income was partially offset by lower other noninterest income. Third quarter expenses decreased $127 million, or 4% linked quarter. Provision was $129 million in the third quarter. And our effective tax rate was 15.5%, which included a favorable impact of certain tax matters in the third quarter. For the full year, we now expect our tax rate to be approximately 16.5%. Turning to Slide 8, we highlight our revenue trends. Third quarter revenue was down $60 million, or 1%, compared with the second quarter. Net interest income of $3.4 billion decreased $92 million or 3%, as higher yields on interest earning assets were more than offset by increased funding costs. Fee income was $1.7 billion and increased $67 million or 4% linked quarter. The primary driver of the increase in fee income was residential and commercial mortgage revenue, which was up $103 million, the majority of which, or $97 million, was related to an increase in the valuation of net mortgage servicing rights. Partially offsetting this, capital markets and advisory revenue decreased $45 million, or 21%, driven by lower trading revenue. M&A advisory activity continued to remain softer in the third quarter despite robust pipelines. Going forward, we do expect this activity to increase in the fourth quarter, which is included in our guidance that I will cover in a few minutes. Other noninterest income of $94 million declined $35 million linked quarter, driven by lower private equity revenue and included negative Visa fair value adjustments totaling $51 million. As a reminder, at September 30, PNC owned 3.5 million Visa Class B shares with an unrecognized gain of approximately $1.3 billion. Turning to Slide 9, our third quarter expenses were down $127 million or 4% linked quarter, which in part reflected our increased CIP program. And we generated 3% positive operating leverage on both the year-to-date and the linked-quarter basis. Importantly, every expense category remained stable or declined compared to the second quarter of 2023. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 10. While overall credit quality remains strong across our portfolio, the pressures we anticipated within the commercial real estate office sector have begun to materialize. Non-performing loans increased $210 million, or 11%, linked quarter. The increase was driven by multi-tenant office, CRE, which increased $373 million, but was partially offset by a decline of $163 million in non-CRE NPLs. In regard to the CRE office portfolio, total criticized loans remained essentially flat quarter-over-quarter at 23%. The difference this quarter is the migration of certain multi-tenant office loans to NPL status, which is an expected outcome as we work to resolve the occupancy and rate challenges inherent to this portfolio. Ultimately, we expect future losses on this portfolio, and we believe we have reserved against those potential losses accordingly. As of September 30, our reserves on the office portfolio were 8.5% of total office loans and, inside of that, 12.5% on the multi-tenant portfolio. Naturally, we'll continue to monitor and review our assumptions, especially in the higher rate environment, to ensure they reflect the real-time market conditions. And a full update of the portfolio is included in the appendix slides. Total delinquencies of $1.3 billion increased $75 million, or 6% linked quarter, driven by higher consumer loan delinquencies. Net loan charge-offs of $121 million declined $73 million, or 38% linked quarter. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans ratio was 15 basis points in the third quarter. And our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.4 billion or 1.7% of total loans on September 30, essentially stable with June 30. Turning to Slide 11. From a capital perspective, we're well positioned with a CET1 ratio of 9.8% as of September 30. This slide illustrates the impact to our capital levels, assuming the Basel III Endgame proposed rules were effective as of September 30. The inclusion of AOCI reduces our ratio by approximately 190 basis points. And the impact of all other proposed Basel III Endgame components are estimated to have an additional negative 40 to 50 basis point impact to our CET1. Taken together, the current Basel III Endgame proposal would increase our risk-weighted assets by approximately 3% to 4%. And our estimated fully phased-in expanded risk-based CET1 ratio would be approximately 7.4%, which is above our current requirement of 7%. In light of the fluidity of the capital proposals, our share repurchase activity remains on pause. We'll continue to evaluate the potential impact of the proposed rules and may resume share repurchases activity depending on market and economic conditions as well as other factors. In regard to the long-term debt proposal, if the rule was effective at the end of the third quarter, our binding constraint would be the long-term debt to risk-weighted assets ratio at both the holding company and the bank level. We estimate our current shortfall at the holding company and the bank to be approximately $1 billion and $8 billion, respectively. And we expect to reach compliance at both the consolidated and bank level through our current funding plan, as well as the restructuring of existing inter-company debt. We acknowledge and want to emphasize that proposals are still in their comment period and the final rules are subject to change. That being said, we're well positioned to comply with the proposals as drafted. Slide 12 provides more detail on the $16 billion portfolio of capital commitment facilities we acquired from Signature Bridge Bank earlier this month. PNC has been active in the capital commitment business for many years. We believe the acquisition will enhance our broader efforts in the private equity sponsor industry. Signature's origination strategy was similar to PNC's, which is focused on building relationships with large and established fund managers. As such, we expect to retain 75% of the portfolio. This acquisition is financially attractive given the purchase price of 99% of par and the high credit quality of the portfolio. Importantly, the transaction does not have a material impact to our capital ratios or tangible book value per share. Slide 13 details our focus on controlling expenses. As Bill mentioned, we remain diligent in our expense management efforts, particularly when considering the current revenue environment. Our Continuous Improvement Program has been in place for over a decade, and through this program we've utilized expense savings to fund our ongoing business growth and technology investments. Over the past 10 years, through CIP, we've identified and completed actions to reinvest $3.7 billion in our company. As you know, we have a 2023 CIP target of $450 million, and we're on track to meet that target. Looking to 2024, even though we've just begun our budgeting process, we do expect a 2024 annual CIP goal of similar magnitude to the 2023 program. Our CIP efforts over the years have allowed us to substantially invest in our company while still delivering low single digit annual expense growth. However, the current environment poses meaningful pressures necessitating expense control measures beyond our annual CIP program. As a result, we took a hard look at our organizational structure and identified opportunities to operate more efficiently through staff reductions, which we began implementing earlier this month. This initiative will decrease the workforce by 4% and is expected to reduce 2024 expenses by approximately $325 million. One-time costs associated with this plan are expected to be approximately $150 million and will be incurred during the fourth quarter of 2023. We believe these actions will position PNC for stronger efficiency going forward. As a result, even though our budgeting cycle isn't complete, we have an objective to keep core expenses stable in 2024, which by definition would exclude the fourth quarter one-time charges. In summary, PNC reported a solid third quarter 2023. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we're expecting a mild recession starting in the first half of 2024, with a contraction in real GDP of less than 1%. We expect the federal funds rate to remain unchanged in the near term between 5.25% and 5.5% through mid-2024 when we expect the Fed to begin cutting rates. Looking ahead, our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2023 is as follows. We expect average loans to be up approximately 3%, including the acquisition of the Signature Bank capital commitment facilities. Net interest income to be down 1% to 2%. Fee income to be up approximately 1% as increased capital markets activity is expected to more than offset the impact of the elevated MSR hedge gains during the third quarter. Other noninterest income to be in the range of $150 million and $200 million, excluding net securities and Visa activity. We expect total core non-interest expense to be up 3% to 4%, which excludes charges related to the workforce reduction. Additionally, this guidance does not contemplate the pending FDIC special assessment, which could occur during the fourth quarter. And we expect fourth quarter net charge-offs to be between $200 million and $250 million. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning.\nBill Demchak: Hey, John. Good morning.\nJohn Pancari: On the -- just regarding the office increase in non-performers that you discussed a bit, can you just give us a little bit more detail? Is that more indicative of -- did you see an acceleration in the deterioration of these credits that were noteworthy in the quarter and that necessitated the move to non-accrual? Or was this more of a function of an ongoing scrub of your portfolio as you're re-evaluating collateral values or whatnot behind properties? And as you do that as well, can you maybe talk about some of the value depreciation you're beginning to see on some properties that have traded? Thanks.\nBill Demchak: I guess what I would say is what you're seeing is kind of our expected cycle through deteriorating credit. So, our criticized list didn't really move. We moved inside of that loans to non-performing. By the way, I think they're actually all still accruing. We just kind of get there because we don't think they're re-financeable in the current market. The move to non-performing from already being criticized comes about as you just watch cap rates creeping higher and adjust the underlying value of the properties accordingly. So, I don't -- I mean, none of this is a surprise. We have heavy reserves against it. We kind of saw it coming. It's the big bulk of these properties moving through the [indiscernible]...\nRob Reilly: Just the migration of the past. We do expect losses, as I said in my comments, but we believe that we're appropriately reserved.\nBill Demchak: There's no -- it's not like there's some new scrubbing, John. I mean, we've been -- we're live on every one of these properties every day. So, it's not like we opened a drawer and found something. We know exactly what each of these are...\nJohn Pancari: Got it. Okay. Thanks, Bill. And then separately on the expense side, can you really help us think about how the $325 million you expect to fall out of the bottom-line from the headcount rationalization, how that would impact the growth rate that you expect overall for expenses in 2024 versus 2023? How should we think about that growth?\nRob Reilly: Yeah. So, I mentioned in my opening comments when we walk down both the CIP that we anticipate implementing in '24, along with this workforce reduction that our objective is to keep '24 expenses stable year-over-year. We haven't completed our budget process. In fact, we're at the beginning of our budget process. So, we don't have a lot of '24 guidance for you other than that is our objective and that will be our expectation.\nBill Demchak: John, the other thing, the reason we kind of put the Continuous Improvement in there is, it's a number that we typically reinvest into our growth businesses in the future of the company. So, that's sort of what's been driving our investment game for the last bunch of years, that continues. What's new is basically dropping the run rate related to personnel and just tightening the ship and what is it a tougher revenue environment.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. I'm sorry, if I could ask just one more. On the Signature acquisition -- of the Signature loans that is, the $0.10 of accretion that you mentioned on that, can you maybe walk us through the components of that? How do you arrive at that amount?\nRob Reilly: Oh, sure. That's basically the yield in terms of the portfolio that we purchased. They are short-term, about a year. So, we do expect that $0.10 a share that we talked about in the fourth quarter and then going into '24. But when we get to '24, of course, we'll include that in our full year guidance.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. Okay, thanks, Rob.\nRob Reilly: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nNate Stein: Hey, guys. This is Nate Stein on behalf of Matt O'Connor. Just one quick follow-up on the expense program. We talked about the $725 million total cost actions. So, outside of the workplace reduction, can you just talk about the -- just the other areas of efficiencies you're investing in? Thanks.\nBill Demchak: I mean, the workforce reduction is a specific number we mentioned of the $325 million inside of Continuous Improvement, which we do every year. We're focused on contract renewals, on management [indiscernible], building occupancy efficiencies, all the things you'd expect us to be focused on in the ordinary course of running the business.\nRob Reilly: And that's a program that we've had in place, as I mentioned, for several years, and allows us to -- and has allowed us to grow annual expenses in the low single-digit range, even with all those investments. And in point of fact, this year, we're pointing to 1% growth year-over-year '23 over '22, and a large part of that is because of our Continuous Improvement Program.\nNate Stein: Great, thanks. And then if I could just ask you a follow-up question on the capital markets fees. So, they came in weaker than expected this quarter. You talked about, I think, stable versus the last quarter. One of your larger peers reported stronger capital markets this morning. Can you just talk about the driver of this? Was it mostly mixed related? And then maybe touch on the outlook near-term, given the macro outlook is better than a few months ago? Thanks.\nBill Demchak: I didn't -- I'm not sure what anybody else reported. My guess was that the trading line item was better than peer fees. But in our case, the bulk of our capital markets income come from various advisory fees from Harris Williams or Solebury or syndications and so forth. And while the pipelines remain robust, if not at record levels, the activity level, while there's been some green shoots, just hasn't been strong. Eventually it flows through. But we're getting a little tired of predicting when it will be.\nRob Reilly: But I would add to that, our capital market is weighted towards our M&A advisory Harris Williams. We had a soft second quarter. At the end of the second quarter, our pipelines were higher than the first quarter. So, we thought naturally that the third quarter would be higher, but it wasn't. So, we find ourselves at the end of the third quarter with even higher pipelines than we had at the beginning of the quarter. But inside of that, a subset of the pipeline are signed deals, which that part is higher than it was at this point last quarter. So, we do expect to see the lift, and our expectations are that we get back to first quarter levels.\nNate Stein: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nScott Siefers: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the call.\nRob Reilly: Hey, Scott.\nScott Siefers: I wanted to ask sort of a broad question -- hey, kind of a broad question on NII. Are we getting to a point where that will start to trough? So, maybe Rob, just sort of some of the puts and takes. It seems like your deposit betas are coming in as expected or better. I know there should be some asset repricing as we look into next year, but some of the larger banks have been sort of vocal about the degree to which they're still over earning on NII, which I think is kind of kept these fears of still bleeding out NII alive sort of industry-wide. Maybe just some thoughts on how you see things playing out for PNC in particular.\nBill Demchak: I'll start.\nRob Reilly: Okay.\nBill Demchak: All of it ends up being dependent on what you think the Fed is going to do. Personally, I think the Fed is higher for longer, even higher for longer than the market expects. In our official forecast, I guess we have two cuts towards the back half of next year. As short rates stay higher, you will continue to see betas creep up, both because we're going to reprice the back book and secondly because you'll just not on betas but just on the shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing. So, when that inflection point is -- has in some ways to do the most with what's going on with the yield curve in the Fed, as the curve continues to flatten by the long-end selling off, all else equal, that helps, notwithstanding the marks on our existing bonds, it helps with the price we get on the roll down and reinvestment. There's too many variables in there, but the basic notion that we're -- at the inflection point, I think, is entirely dependent on what happens with the Fed in the coming year. And we haven't done our budget yet, so we're not going to call it.\nRob Reilly: Yeah. I would just add to that, just observations. Deposits continue to decline. We expected that, but that decline is slowing. Betas have gone up, but the increase has slowed. In fact, in the third quarter, the actuals came in lower than what we expected for the first time since rates have been increasing rapidly. So things have slowed as far as that trajectory is, and then obviously the inflection point issues that Bill just covered are valid.\nScott Siefers: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then maybe a question on credit as well. I guess just in the last few weeks, there's been a couple commercial hiccups in the industry in the shared national credit space. Just was hoping you might be able to remind us about PNC's exposure in this next space, and then just generalization sort of how that portfolio quality compares to the rest of the book, how much you lead, et cetera?\nRob Reilly: Yeah, pretty good there, Scott, in terms of credit. So, all of the noise, so to speak, is in the commercial real estate office space that we spoke about. As far as the shared national credit results went, they're complete. They're represented in our numbers. And it was pretty benign in terms of total deals. Upgrades were more than downgrades, but they were a handful of each.\nScott Siefers: All right. Thank you very much.\nRob Reilly: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: You guys gave us good color on the burn-off of the securities portfolio. And the question I had is, it looked like this quarter you put more up at the Fed. So, what are you guys doing with the cash flows from the portfolio now in terms of where you're putting it in other securities? And then, second, once the Basel III Endgame is finalized, how do you think you guys will approach in carrying your securities? Will you carry less than available for sale or more? Can you share with us your thoughts there as well?\nBill Demchak: I guess just with the existing book, it's running down. We've run down the DV01 in our securities and swaps through the course of the entire year. We've had some purchases, but not to the extent we've had maturities. And we've been buying, I don't know what average yield is, but stuff that roughly carries flat versus leaving it in the Fed. Going forward, the switch from available for sale to held to maturity doesn't really affect anything. It's an accounting entry. So, we'll keep some amount unavailable for sale to the extent we trade around that book, but we don't trade around that book all that much, and the rest will just buy into held to maturity, which is, by the way, what we've been doing thus far since rates have gone up.\nRob Reilly: There's a couple things to add there. One of the uses of cash, Gerard, was the purchase of the Signature loans. So that was our biggest...\nBill Demchak: Yeah, that was biggest...\nRob Reilly: Yeah, that was our biggest outlay. And then on the [split] (ph). Bill has it right. Where we are now is probably about where we are plus or minus to your views in terms of what -- but where we got to holding it all to 100% of AFS was the tailoring, which has passed us. So, we're back to sort of the normal [split] (ph).\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then as a follow-up, you just mentioned about the purchase of the Signature loans. You guys are in a good position that you're not being impacted by Basel III Endgame, RWA, inflation like some of the big money centers, of course. Do you think there's going to be opportunities for you guys to buy other portfolios, not from the FDIC per se, but from some of your peers or banks that do mitigation strategies to get to these RWA targets they need to get to?\nBill Demchak: Yeah, I suppose there could be. I don't know that we've actually seen any. We get pitched by everybody to execute one, which we have no need for.\nRob Reilly: Right.\nBill Demchak: But the purchase side of that is actually pretty attractive. They're giving away a lot of economics. So, it's actually a good thought. I'll go look around.\nRob Reilly: No, we have the capital flexibility to do it, and people know our telephone number.\nGerard Cassidy: Yeah. And then specifically, it would be more in the C&I space or consumer? Or do you guys have a preference should they call that phone number, Rob?\nBill Demchak: It's -- look, we're intelligent -- hopefully, intelligent takers of risk at the right price.\nGerard Cassidy: Got it.\nBill Demchak: We can evaluate what's out there.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. All right. Thank you, gentlemen.\nBryan Gill: Next question, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBill Carcache: Thanks. Good morning. Bill and Rob, I wanted to follow up on your office CRE comments. How much of an impact to debt service coverage are P&C customers experiencing from swaps that are rolling off, say in cases where they issued floating rate debt under SERP two to three years ago, and put on swaps to lock in low fixed rates at the time but are now facing a significant reset as those swaps mature? I'm just curious if how significant that maturing swap dynamic is inside of the portfolio and whether you feel like you have a good handle on that dynamic?\nBill Demchak: I don't know the answer to that. I would tell you, though, the bulk of our stuff, and you see it in our maturity schedules, we're kind of stabilization loans-ish project loans. And so in that instance, the hedge dynamics of somebody would put on that loan, in my experience, would be less than what they would have done on a term, 10-year CNBS alternative. So, my guess is it's not -- I think they're just in trouble for floating rate loans from lease rates going down, from vacancies going up, and from the rehab costs of redoing floors for...\nRob Reilly: Capital improvements.\nBill Demchak: Yeah. Just dropping the value of the buildings.\nBill Carcache: Understood. That's helpful. Thank you. And if I could follow up on that, if refinancing loans at current market rates would cause debt service coverage ratios to fall below 1, can you discuss how much leeway there is inside of P&C to refinance loans under potentially more favorable terms to allow debt service coverage ratios to remain satisfactory? And then maybe just more broadly across the industry, do you think so-called extend and pretend dynamics could become pervasive, particularly since banks have made it clear they don't want to own office buildings and we've seen some commentary from regulators sort of urging banks to work with their customers?\nBill Demchak: I think the extend part is possible. I think the pretend part, that doesn't work.\nRob Reilly: Not so good.\nBill Demchak: Yeah. We work with borrowers to figure out how to maximize the value of the property because that's ultimately going to maximize the value of our loan. In some instances that means taking the building and selling it. In some instances that means getting more equity capital, extending a loan at a debt service coverage ratio we normally wouldn't under the theory that they can lease it up itself. But each and every one of those decisions is a decision tree based on what's the net present value of what we PNC can get against our loan. In any event, if we do something that is uneconomic relative to the original loan, that shows up in our reserves or charge-offs or so on and so forth. There's no pretend involved.\nBill Carcache: Understood. That's very helpful, Bill. Thank you. And if I could squeeze in one last one on the point about whether we're at an inflection point on deposit betas sort of depending on the Fed. Does it [correlate that] (ph) suggest that we could see terminal beta expectations potentially drift higher relative to prior guidance, again, depending on how much higher for longer persists?\nBill Demchak: Yeah, I think. And by the way, this isn't a forecast. I think it's just common sense, right? To the extent that we still have a back book of business as does everybody that hasn't necessarily repriced, and if rates are pinned at 5% forever in time, that beta will continue to go up. It's a function of how high does the Fed go and how long do they stay there. And everybody's been wrong so far. So, yeah, it's a possibility.\nBill Carcache: Understood. I wanted to ask you another one about the CFPB sort of open banking proposal bill, but I'll queue back up for that one. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Peter Troisi with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nPeter Troisi: Hi. Thanks very much for the disclosure on the long-term debt shortfalls in the slides. You talked about $10 billion of debt issuance annually, but do you anticipate needing to issue more than $10 billion to close the shortfalls that you disclosed in the slides? Or can the $8 billion shortfall at the bank be met just by restructuring existing internal debt? And I guess the question really is, do you expect to issue debt at the holding company specifically to invest in the internal debt of the bank?\nRob Reilly: Yeah. This is Rob. So, good question. So, in regard to the long-term debt, our message is, independent of the rules, as we resume a more conventional funding structure in terms of our debt to our deposits that was pre-COVID, we would be compliant. So that's the takeaway. In regard to how we get there, it's a combination of everything that you outlined. There will be issuances at the holding company as part of our ongoing plan that will then ultimately be papered down to the bank, but there's a lot of moving parts there. The message is we'll get there and we would have gotten there independent of these rules.\nPeter Troisi: Okay. Thank you.\nRob Reilly: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBill Carcache: Yeah, thanks for taking my follow-up. So, Bill, I was hoping you could just share your thoughts on the CFPB's plans to propose an open banking rule. There's a view that open banking essentially forces the industry to hand over the keys to the customer relationship. You've talked in the past about sort of the dynamic of like passwords and all that kind of stuff, but I was just hoping you could speak broadly to that point or that topic.\nBill Demchak: Yeah, I think, what I've seen thus far out of CFPB commentary is they're largely focused on some of the right things. Make it easier for customers, agree with that. Secure data, agree with that. Don't allow data to be sold and commercialized without customer permission, agree with that. Make customers agree to specific data items that they want to share in a secure environment. So, all of that stuff versus where we are today where it's a free for all and there's a lot of fraud, actually I'm in favor of. The notion of kind of open banking where somehow I can just lift and shift my account from one bank to another because now there's technology to do it, I'm not that afraid of that. It's more in the technology to allow it in a secure manner, dependent of what rule is written, doesn't exist today. And I kind of look at what they're doing and hope it's a step in the right direction on security and the safety and soundness of customer information, leading to a reduction in fraud across the industry. And the sound bites are, that's where they're going.\nBill Carcache: Okay, that's helpful. I had heard something along the lines of some of the actions they're taking are intended to make it easier for customers to \"break up with their banks.\" And so, I was wondering if there was anything in the language. You mentioned how you're not worried about the ability to shift the relationship...\nBill Demchak: Look, at the end of the day -- by the way, if that happened, terrific. We compete every day and we have good customer service and great products, we'll be a net beneficiary. Practically, the technology to allow that to happen, so just think about the notion of, okay, now you have connected APIs that allow somebody to gather information and move information. Now you need to build a program that keeps track of the back book while you open a new book on a checking account, transfers, balances on cards and all. So, eventually somebody will come up with a cool business model that might be able to do that on the back of laws that allow it on the back of APIs that haven't been written yet on the back of technology that links all the banks in question together. But that hasn't happened yet.\nBill Carcache: That's great. Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nBill Demchak: Hey, Mike.\nMike Mayo: Sorry about that earlier. So, in terms of the decline in commercial loans, how much of that decline is due to softer demand and how much of that is deliberate as you look to shore up capital more than you previously would have intended?\nBill Demchak: Well, none of it's deliberate per se. We've seen some drop in utilization. We've seen a drop in kind of refinance rate as people are -- think about a corporate loan revolver where it's a three-year and every two years you renew it for the next three years. Everybody's kind of extending out under the hope that things are going to get better on spreads. So, there's just been less activity. At the margin, we are extending less credit into credit-only new relationships on the hope that we're going to get fees versus protecting our wallet where we already have a lot of fees and get cross-sell. But that's kind of at the margin thing.\nBill Demchak: Yeah, that's small. It's on the demand side.\nMike Mayo: Okay. And you're very clear about the expense guidance and the tough actions you're taking with personnel. Did you give an outlook for operating leverage over next year? Do you think the pace of expense decline will be faster than any decline in revenues? And specifically to the fourth quarter, the SBNY loan acquisition, looks like it adds a couple percent to your fourth quarter NII, but you're guiding down 1% to 2%. So that decline might be a little bit more than some had expected. It's more than you had expected. The quarter decline looks like 2% to 4% in the fourth quarter. Is that math correct? Why is it down maybe more than you thought? And the big question, though, is revenues versus expenses over the next year?\nRob Reilly: Bill, do you want me to? I can. Well, on the expense issue, we did say that we expect '24 expenses to be stable. And we haven't finished our budgeting cycle, so we can't really answer in terms of anything beyond that in '24. In regard to the NII and the fourth quarter guide, it does include the Signature acquisition, which we said was about $0.10 a share. Recall, in the third quarter, we had expected 3% to 5% decline. We ended up down 3%. So, when we look to the fourth quarter, roll all that together, that's how we get down 1% to 2%.\nMike Mayo: Got it. Okay, thank you.\nRob Reilly: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKen Usdin: Thanks. Good morning, guys. One follow-up on the Signature acquisition as well. So just wondering if you can provide a little more context on the portfolio, seeing the line that you're expecting to hold on to -- or expecting to hold on to 75% of the relationships over time, are you bringing on new team members? Is there expenses along with that? And just anything you can help us in terms of like the duration of the loans and is there just kind of a natural run-off that happens given I think that they're generally a pretty short duration type of loan? Thanks.\nBill Demchak: Yeah. It's de minimis adds of people that we're bringing on. We're already in the business. We have the technology to be in the business. We know the clients. The rundown, we're kind of saying, 75% probably survives. Most of that is simply a function of where we have overlap with clients and the size hold that we want to have for a particular client, we'd syndicate more of it as we kind of right-size our hold. There may be inside of that book of business a handful of people that we would choose not to renew, but their credit quality is pristine. We know we underwrote every fund that is in that. And through time, you would expect that as they mature, we'll renew and some period of time out a couple of years, we'll end up with 75% of the notional that we started with, and you'll have no clue between now and then how much it was.\nRob Reilly: But that's right. De minimis expense is involved with it, and we're excited about it.\nKen Usdin: Yeah, that's a fair point on we won't know. That's what I was trying to ask. The second question is...\nBill Demchak: But to be clear, I mean, it'll be lost inside of our book of business.\nRob Reilly: It becomes part of our...\nBill Demchak: It becomes part of our C&I balances.\nKen Usdin: Completely understood. The second question I had, Bill, is you mentioned in a higher longer for environment, we got to see what the Fed does in terms of where deposit betas and mix goes. On the asset side, however, though, can you help us understand what happens in terms of fixed rate loan repricing versus -- and how much you might still have left in that versus obviously when we get to a peak in Fed funds, we'll know that the variable rates have -- will have gotten there?\nBill Demchak: Yeah. So we have, I mean, beyond our securities book and swaps, which obviously we will reprice over the next several years, we have, I don't know the percentage off the top of my head, percentage of our loan book, either fixed rate to begin with, think of an auto loan, or with swaps on top of it, floating rate loan, we swap to fix, and those fixed rate loans and swaps are shorter duration typically than what we have in the securities book and there's a lot of dry powder there that we'll reprice. We are back to this notion that, hey, we're out there competing and growing this company, we will be originating those loans as they reprice. We're not dumping assets and getting out of things. It's going to shrink the total volume that's on our book.\nKen Usdin: Yeah. No, I totally understand. I would think it would be a net positive as an offset to whatever has happened.\nBill Demchak: You have the competing parts, right? We're going to have repricings of fixed rate assets fighting reprices of our liabilities. At some point, that's going to cross, and banks are going to grow NII at high percentages. I just can't tell you when that is yet, and we haven't done our budget next year.\nKen Usdin: Yeah, that's fair. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And there are no further questions on the phone lines at this time.\nBryan Gill: Okay. Well, thank you...\nBill Demchak: Thanks, everybody.\nBryan Gill: Yeah. Thanks for participating. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to the IR team. Thanks.\nRob Reilly: Thank you.\nOperator: That does conclude the conference call for today, and we do thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Rob Reilly",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis and comparing to the second quarter. Loans were down 2% and averaged $320 billion. Investment securities declined $1 billion or 1%. Cash balances at the Federal Reserve increased $7 billion to $38 billion. Deposits of $423 billion declined $3 billion or 1%. Borrowed funds increased $2 billion, primarily due to senior debt issuances near the end of the second quarter. At quarter-end, AOCI was a negative $10.3 billion compared to a negative $9.5 billion at June 30, reflecting higher interest rates. However, tangible book value increased to $78.16 per common share as retained earnings growth exceeded the negative impact of AOCI. Common dividends in the quarter totaled approximately $600 million. And we remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.8% as of September 30, 2023, which increased 30 basis points linked quarter. Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Third quarter loans averaged $320 billion and increased $6.5 billion or 2% compared to the same period a year ago, reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans. Compared to the second quarter, average loan balances declined 2% as growth in consumer was more than offset by a decline in commercial. Consumer loans grew approximately $500 million, reflecting higher residential mortgage and credit card balances. Commercial loans averaged $218 billion, a decline of $5.5 billion, driven by lower utilization as well as paydowns outpacing new production. Loan yields increased 18 basis points to 5.75% in the third quarter, predominantly driven by the higher rate environment. Slide 5 covers our deposits in more detail. Average deposits decreased $3 billion, or 1%, due to a decline in consumer deposits that was somewhat offset by a growth in commercial deposits. In regard to mix, consolidated noninterest-bearing deposits were 26% in the third quarter, down slightly from 27% in the second quarter, and consistent with our expectations. And we still expect the noninterest-bearing portion of our deposits to stabilize in the mid-20% range. Commercial noninterest-bearing deposits represented 42% of total commercial deposits in the third quarter compared to 45% in the second quarter. And our consumer deposit noninterest-bearing mix remains stable at 10%. Our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 2.26% during the third quarter, up from 1.96% in the prior quarter. And as of September 30, our cumulative deposit beta was 41%, which was slightly better than our July expectation. Slide 6 details our investment security and swap portfolios. Average investment securities of $140 billion decreased $1 billion, or 1%, as curtailed purchase activity was more than offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities. The securities portfolio yield increased 5 basis points to 2.57%, reflecting new purchase yields of 5.5% and the runoff of lower-yielding securities. As of September 30, the duration of investment securities portfolio was 4.2 years. Our received fixed swaps pointed to the commercial loan book totaled $35 billion on September 30. The weighted average received fixed rate of our swap portfolio increased 34 basis points to 2.07% and the duration of the portfolio was 2.4 years as of September 30. Accumulated other comprehensive loss increased by approximately $800 million in the third quarter as a negative impact of higher rates more than offset paydowns and maturities during the quarter. Importantly, as lower rate securities and swaps roll off, we expect our securities yield to continue to increase, resulting in a meaningful improvement to tangible book value from AOCI accretion. Turning to the income statement on Slide 7. For the first nine months of 2023, revenue grew 5% compared to the same period a year ago, reflecting higher interest rates and business growth. Noninterest expense grew 2% and was well controlled despite a higher FDIC assessment rate and inflationary pressures. As a result, we generated 3% positive operating leverage, and PPNR grew 9%. For the third quarter, net income was $1.6 billion, or $3.60 per share. Total revenue of $5.2 billion decreased $60 million, or 1%, compared to the second quarter of 2023. Net interest income declined $92 million, or 3%. And our net interest margin was 2.71%, a decline of 8 basis points. Noninterest income increased $32 million, or 2%, as higher fee income was partially offset by lower other noninterest income. Third quarter expenses decreased $127 million, or 4% linked quarter. Provision was $129 million in the third quarter. And our effective tax rate was 15.5%, which included a favorable impact of certain tax matters in the third quarter. For the full year, we now expect our tax rate to be approximately 16.5%. Turning to Slide 8, we highlight our revenue trends. Third quarter revenue was down $60 million, or 1%, compared with the second quarter. Net interest income of $3.4 billion decreased $92 million or 3%, as higher yields on interest earning assets were more than offset by increased funding costs. Fee income was $1.7 billion and increased $67 million or 4% linked quarter. The primary driver of the increase in fee income was residential and commercial mortgage revenue, which was up $103 million, the majority of which, or $97 million, was related to an increase in the valuation of net mortgage servicing rights. Partially offsetting this, capital markets and advisory revenue decreased $45 million, or 21%, driven by lower trading revenue. M&A advisory activity continued to remain softer in the third quarter despite robust pipelines. Going forward, we do expect this activity to increase in the fourth quarter, which is included in our guidance that I will cover in a few minutes. Other noninterest income of $94 million declined $35 million linked quarter, driven by lower private equity revenue and included negative Visa fair value adjustments totaling $51 million. As a reminder, at September 30, PNC owned 3.5 million Visa Class B shares with an unrecognized gain of approximately $1.3 billion. Turning to Slide 9, our third quarter expenses were down $127 million or 4% linked quarter, which in part reflected our increased CIP program. And we generated 3% positive operating leverage on both the year-to-date and the linked-quarter basis. Importantly, every expense category remained stable or declined compared to the second quarter of 2023. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 10. While overall credit quality remains strong across our portfolio, the pressures we anticipated within the commercial real estate office sector have begun to materialize. Non-performing loans increased $210 million, or 11%, linked quarter. The increase was driven by multi-tenant office, CRE, which increased $373 million, but was partially offset by a decline of $163 million in non-CRE NPLs. In regard to the CRE office portfolio, total criticized loans remained essentially flat quarter-over-quarter at 23%. The difference this quarter is the migration of certain multi-tenant office loans to NPL status, which is an expected outcome as we work to resolve the occupancy and rate challenges inherent to this portfolio. Ultimately, we expect future losses on this portfolio, and we believe we have reserved against those potential losses accordingly. As of September 30, our reserves on the office portfolio were 8.5% of total office loans and, inside of that, 12.5% on the multi-tenant portfolio. Naturally, we'll continue to monitor and review our assumptions, especially in the higher rate environment, to ensure they reflect the real-time market conditions. And a full update of the portfolio is included in the appendix slides. Total delinquencies of $1.3 billion increased $75 million, or 6% linked quarter, driven by higher consumer loan delinquencies. Net loan charge-offs of $121 million declined $73 million, or 38% linked quarter. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans ratio was 15 basis points in the third quarter. And our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.4 billion or 1.7% of total loans on September 30, essentially stable with June 30. Turning to Slide 11. From a capital perspective, we're well positioned with a CET1 ratio of 9.8% as of September 30. This slide illustrates the impact to our capital levels, assuming the Basel III Endgame proposed rules were effective as of September 30. The inclusion of AOCI reduces our ratio by approximately 190 basis points. And the impact of all other proposed Basel III Endgame components are estimated to have an additional negative 40 to 50 basis point impact to our CET1. Taken together, the current Basel III Endgame proposal would increase our risk-weighted assets by approximately 3% to 4%. And our estimated fully phased-in expanded risk-based CET1 ratio would be approximately 7.4%, which is above our current requirement of 7%. In light of the fluidity of the capital proposals, our share repurchase activity remains on pause. We'll continue to evaluate the potential impact of the proposed rules and may resume share repurchases activity depending on market and economic conditions as well as other factors. In regard to the long-term debt proposal, if the rule was effective at the end of the third quarter, our binding constraint would be the long-term debt to risk-weighted assets ratio at both the holding company and the bank level. We estimate our current shortfall at the holding company and the bank to be approximately $1 billion and $8 billion, respectively. And we expect to reach compliance at both the consolidated and bank level through our current funding plan, as well as the restructuring of existing inter-company debt. We acknowledge and want to emphasize that proposals are still in their comment period and the final rules are subject to change. That being said, we're well positioned to comply with the proposals as drafted. Slide 12 provides more detail on the $16 billion portfolio of capital commitment facilities we acquired from Signature Bridge Bank earlier this month. PNC has been active in the capital commitment business for many years. We believe the acquisition will enhance our broader efforts in the private equity sponsor industry. Signature's origination strategy was similar to PNC's, which is focused on building relationships with large and established fund managers. As such, we expect to retain 75% of the portfolio. This acquisition is financially attractive given the purchase price of 99% of par and the high credit quality of the portfolio. Importantly, the transaction does not have a material impact to our capital ratios or tangible book value per share. Slide 13 details our focus on controlling expenses. As Bill mentioned, we remain diligent in our expense management efforts, particularly when considering the current revenue environment. Our Continuous Improvement Program has been in place for over a decade, and through this program we've utilized expense savings to fund our ongoing business growth and technology investments. Over the past 10 years, through CIP, we've identified and completed actions to reinvest $3.7 billion in our company. As you know, we have a 2023 CIP target of $450 million, and we're on track to meet that target. Looking to 2024, even though we've just begun our budgeting process, we do expect a 2024 annual CIP goal of similar magnitude to the 2023 program. Our CIP efforts over the years have allowed us to substantially invest in our company while still delivering low single digit annual expense growth. However, the current environment poses meaningful pressures necessitating expense control measures beyond our annual CIP program. As a result, we took a hard look at our organizational structure and identified opportunities to operate more efficiently through staff reductions, which we began implementing earlier this month. This initiative will decrease the workforce by 4% and is expected to reduce 2024 expenses by approximately $325 million. One-time costs associated with this plan are expected to be approximately $150 million and will be incurred during the fourth quarter of 2023. We believe these actions will position PNC for stronger efficiency going forward. As a result, even though our budgeting cycle isn't complete, we have an objective to keep core expenses stable in 2024, which by definition would exclude the fourth quarter one-time charges. In summary, PNC reported a solid third quarter 2023. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we're expecting a mild recession starting in the first half of 2024, with a contraction in real GDP of less than 1%. We expect the federal funds rate to remain unchanged in the near term between 5.25% and 5.5% through mid-2024 when we expect the Fed to begin cutting rates. Looking ahead, our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2023 is as follows. We expect average loans to be up approximately 3%, including the acquisition of the Signature Bank capital commitment facilities. Net interest income to be down 1% to 2%. Fee income to be up approximately 1% as increased capital markets activity is expected to more than offset the impact of the elevated MSR hedge gains during the third quarter. Other noninterest income to be in the range of $150 million and $200 million, excluding net securities and Visa activity. We expect total core non-interest expense to be up 3% to 4%, which excludes charges related to the workforce reduction. Additionally, this guidance does not contemplate the pending FDIC special assessment, which could occur during the fourth quarter. And we expect fourth quarter net charge-offs to be between $200 million and $250 million. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions. Just the migration of the past. We do expect losses, as I said in my comments, but we believe that we're appropriately reserved. Yeah. So, I mentioned in my opening comments when we walk down both the CIP that we anticipate implementing in '24, along with this workforce reduction that our objective is to keep '24 expenses stable year-over-year. We haven't completed our budget process. In fact, we're at the beginning of our budget process. So, we don't have a lot of '24 guidance for you other than that is our objective and that will be our expectation. Oh, sure. That's basically the yield in terms of the portfolio that we purchased. They are short-term, about a year. So, we do expect that $0.10 a share that we talked about in the fourth quarter and then going into '24. But when we get to '24, of course, we'll include that in our full year guidance. Sure. And that's a program that we've had in place, as I mentioned, for several years, and allows us to -- and has allowed us to grow annual expenses in the low single-digit range, even with all those investments. And in point of fact, this year, we're pointing to 1% growth year-over-year '23 over '22, and a large part of that is because of our Continuous Improvement Program. But I would add to that, our capital market is weighted towards our M&A advisory Harris Williams. We had a soft second quarter. At the end of the second quarter, our pipelines were higher than the first quarter. So, we thought naturally that the third quarter would be higher, but it wasn't. So, we find ourselves at the end of the third quarter with even higher pipelines than we had at the beginning of the quarter. But inside of that, a subset of the pipeline are signed deals, which that part is higher than it was at this point last quarter. So, we do expect to see the lift, and our expectations are that we get back to first quarter levels. Hey, Scott. Okay. Yeah. I would just add to that, just observations. Deposits continue to decline. We expected that, but that decline is slowing. Betas have gone up, but the increase has slowed. In fact, in the third quarter, the actuals came in lower than what we expected for the first time since rates have been increasing rapidly. So things have slowed as far as that trajectory is, and then obviously the inflection point issues that Bill just covered are valid. Yeah, pretty good there, Scott, in terms of credit. So, all of the noise, so to speak, is in the commercial real estate office space that we spoke about. As far as the shared national credit results went, they're complete. They're represented in our numbers. And it was pretty benign in terms of total deals. Upgrades were more than downgrades, but they were a handful of each. Sure. There's a couple things to add there. One of the uses of cash, Gerard, was the purchase of the Signature loans. So that was our biggest... Yeah, that was our biggest outlay. And then on the [split] (ph). Bill has it right. Where we are now is probably about where we are plus or minus to your views in terms of what -- but where we got to holding it all to 100% of AFS was the tailoring, which has passed us. So, we're back to sort of the normal [split] (ph). Right. No, we have the capital flexibility to do it, and people know our telephone number. Capital improvements. Not so good. Yeah. This is Rob. So, good question. So, in regard to the long-term debt, our message is, independent of the rules, as we resume a more conventional funding structure in terms of our debt to our deposits that was pre-COVID, we would be compliant. So that's the takeaway. In regard to how we get there, it's a combination of everything that you outlined. There will be issuances at the holding company as part of our ongoing plan that will then ultimately be papered down to the bank, but there's a lot of moving parts there. The message is we'll get there and we would have gotten there independent of these rules. Sure. Bill, do you want me to? I can. Well, on the expense issue, we did say that we expect '24 expenses to be stable. And we haven't finished our budgeting cycle, so we can't really answer in terms of anything beyond that in '24. In regard to the NII and the fourth quarter guide, it does include the Signature acquisition, which we said was about $0.10 a share. Recall, in the third quarter, we had expected 3% to 5% decline. We ended up down 3%. So, when we look to the fourth quarter, roll all that together, that's how we get down 1% to 2%. Sure. But that's right. De minimis expense is involved with it, and we're excited about it. It becomes part of our... Thank you."

            "name": "Bill Demchak",
            "content": "Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. As you can see on the slide, we delivered strong results in the third quarter, generating $1.6 billion in net income, or $3.60 in diluted earnings per share. Rob is going to take you through the numbers in a moment, but I'd like to touch on a few highlights. First, in a challenging operating environment, we generated 3 points of positive operating leverage through disciplined expense management. Our credit quality remained strong during the quarter, reflecting our thoughtful approach to managing risk, customer selection, and long-term relationship development, all of which have historically served us well in challenging economic cycles. Next, we strengthened our capital and liquidity positions even further during the quarter. While we continue to monitor discussions regarding regulatory changes in these areas, based on our current estimates, we are well positioned to meet the proposed requirements without meaningful changes to how we operate. We continue to execute on our key strategic priorities, including our expansion market efforts in upgrading our digital capabilities. And we leveraged our strong balance sheet to take advantage of opportunities such as the Signature Bank loans that we recently acquired. Finally, we are focused on expense management, particularly in the current environment, and have taken actions to maintain disciplined expense control. We increased our Continuous Improvement goal last quarter from $400 million to $450 million, and we are on track to achieve that goal in 2023. Looking ahead, we expect to have CIP savings within a similar range for 2024. And as a reminder, we used savings from this program to fund investments in key growth markets and technology. In addition, earlier this month, we began executing on staff reductions, which will reduce our 2024 expenses by $325 million and will fall to the bottom-line. All told, we are implementing more than $725 million of expense management actions that will have impact on 2024. While decisions involving personnel are never easy, we believe they will help us more effectively and efficiently deliver for our customers and our stakeholders, and we'll continue to be diligent in our expense management going forward. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Hey, John. Good morning. I guess what I would say is what you're seeing is kind of our expected cycle through deteriorating credit. So, our criticized list didn't really move. We moved inside of that loans to non-performing. By the way, I think they're actually all still accruing. We just kind of get there because we don't think they're re-financeable in the current market. The move to non-performing from already being criticized comes about as you just watch cap rates creeping higher and adjust the underlying value of the properties accordingly. So, I don't -- I mean, none of this is a surprise. We have heavy reserves against it. We kind of saw it coming. It's the big bulk of these properties moving through the [indiscernible]... There's no -- it's not like there's some new scrubbing, John. I mean, we've been -- we're live on every one of these properties every day. So, it's not like we opened a drawer and found something. We know exactly what each of these are... John, the other thing, the reason we kind of put the Continuous Improvement in there is, it's a number that we typically reinvest into our growth businesses in the future of the company. So, that's sort of what's been driving our investment game for the last bunch of years, that continues. What's new is basically dropping the run rate related to personnel and just tightening the ship and what is it a tougher revenue environment. I mean, the workforce reduction is a specific number we mentioned of the $325 million inside of Continuous Improvement, which we do every year. We're focused on contract renewals, on management [indiscernible], building occupancy efficiencies, all the things you'd expect us to be focused on in the ordinary course of running the business. I didn't -- I'm not sure what anybody else reported. My guess was that the trading line item was better than peer fees. But in our case, the bulk of our capital markets income come from various advisory fees from Harris Williams or Solebury or syndications and so forth. And while the pipelines remain robust, if not at record levels, the activity level, while there's been some green shoots, just hasn't been strong. Eventually it flows through. But we're getting a little tired of predicting when it will be. I'll start. All of it ends up being dependent on what you think the Fed is going to do. Personally, I think the Fed is higher for longer, even higher for longer than the market expects. In our official forecast, I guess we have two cuts towards the back half of next year. As short rates stay higher, you will continue to see betas creep up, both because we're going to reprice the back book and secondly because you'll just not on betas but just on the shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing. So, when that inflection point is -- has in some ways to do the most with what's going on with the yield curve in the Fed, as the curve continues to flatten by the long-end selling off, all else equal, that helps, notwithstanding the marks on our existing bonds, it helps with the price we get on the roll down and reinvestment. There's too many variables in there, but the basic notion that we're -- at the inflection point, I think, is entirely dependent on what happens with the Fed in the coming year. And we haven't done our budget yet, so we're not going to call it. I guess just with the existing book, it's running down. We've run down the DV01 in our securities and swaps through the course of the entire year. We've had some purchases, but not to the extent we've had maturities. And we've been buying, I don't know what average yield is, but stuff that roughly carries flat versus leaving it in the Fed. Going forward, the switch from available for sale to held to maturity doesn't really affect anything. It's an accounting entry. So, we'll keep some amount unavailable for sale to the extent we trade around that book, but we don't trade around that book all that much, and the rest will just buy into held to maturity, which is, by the way, what we've been doing thus far since rates have gone up. Yeah, that was biggest... Yeah, I suppose there could be. I don't know that we've actually seen any. We get pitched by everybody to execute one, which we have no need for. But the purchase side of that is actually pretty attractive. They're giving away a lot of economics. So, it's actually a good thought. I'll go look around. It's -- look, we're intelligent -- hopefully, intelligent takers of risk at the right price. We can evaluate what's out there. I don't know the answer to that. I would tell you, though, the bulk of our stuff, and you see it in our maturity schedules, we're kind of stabilization loans-ish project loans. And so in that instance, the hedge dynamics of somebody would put on that loan, in my experience, would be less than what they would have done on a term, 10-year CNBS alternative. So, my guess is it's not -- I think they're just in trouble for floating rate loans from lease rates going down, from vacancies going up, and from the rehab costs of redoing floors for... Yeah. Just dropping the value of the buildings. I think the extend part is possible. I think the pretend part, that doesn't work. Yeah. We work with borrowers to figure out how to maximize the value of the property because that's ultimately going to maximize the value of our loan. In some instances that means taking the building and selling it. In some instances that means getting more equity capital, extending a loan at a debt service coverage ratio we normally wouldn't under the theory that they can lease it up itself. But each and every one of those decisions is a decision tree based on what's the net present value of what we PNC can get against our loan. In any event, if we do something that is uneconomic relative to the original loan, that shows up in our reserves or charge-offs or so on and so forth. There's no pretend involved. Yeah, I think. And by the way, this isn't a forecast. I think it's just common sense, right? To the extent that we still have a back book of business as does everybody that hasn't necessarily repriced, and if rates are pinned at 5% forever in time, that beta will continue to go up. It's a function of how high does the Fed go and how long do they stay there. And everybody's been wrong so far. So, yeah, it's a possibility. Yeah, I think, what I've seen thus far out of CFPB commentary is they're largely focused on some of the right things. Make it easier for customers, agree with that. Secure data, agree with that. Don't allow data to be sold and commercialized without customer permission, agree with that. Make customers agree to specific data items that they want to share in a secure environment. So, all of that stuff versus where we are today where it's a free for all and there's a lot of fraud, actually I'm in favor of. The notion of kind of open banking where somehow I can just lift and shift my account from one bank to another because now there's technology to do it, I'm not that afraid of that. It's more in the technology to allow it in a secure manner, dependent of what rule is written, doesn't exist today. And I kind of look at what they're doing and hope it's a step in the right direction on security and the safety and soundness of customer information, leading to a reduction in fraud across the industry. And the sound bites are, that's where they're going. Look, at the end of the day -- by the way, if that happened, terrific. We compete every day and we have good customer service and great products, we'll be a net beneficiary. Practically, the technology to allow that to happen, so just think about the notion of, okay, now you have connected APIs that allow somebody to gather information and move information. Now you need to build a program that keeps track of the back book while you open a new book on a checking account, transfers, balances on cards and all. So, eventually somebody will come up with a cool business model that might be able to do that on the back of laws that allow it on the back of APIs that haven't been written yet on the back of technology that links all the banks in question together. But that hasn't happened yet. Hey, Mike. Well, none of it's deliberate per se. We've seen some drop in utilization. We've seen a drop in kind of refinance rate as people are -- think about a corporate loan revolver where it's a three-year and every two years you renew it for the next three years. Everybody's kind of extending out under the hope that things are going to get better on spreads. So, there's just been less activity. At the margin, we are extending less credit into credit-only new relationships on the hope that we're going to get fees versus protecting our wallet where we already have a lot of fees and get cross-sell. But that's kind of at the margin thing. Yeah, that's small. It's on the demand side. Yeah. It's de minimis adds of people that we're bringing on. We're already in the business. We have the technology to be in the business. We know the clients. The rundown, we're kind of saying, 75% probably survives. Most of that is simply a function of where we have overlap with clients and the size hold that we want to have for a particular client, we'd syndicate more of it as we kind of right-size our hold. There may be inside of that book of business a handful of people that we would choose not to renew, but their credit quality is pristine. We know we underwrote every fund that is in that. And through time, you would expect that as they mature, we'll renew and some period of time out a couple of years, we'll end up with 75% of the notional that we started with, and you'll have no clue between now and then how much it was. But to be clear, I mean, it'll be lost inside of our book of business. It becomes part of our C&I balances. Yeah. So we have, I mean, beyond our securities book and swaps, which obviously we will reprice over the next several years, we have, I don't know the percentage off the top of my head, percentage of our loan book, either fixed rate to begin with, think of an auto loan, or with swaps on top of it, floating rate loan, we swap to fix, and those fixed rate loans and swaps are shorter duration typically than what we have in the securities book and there's a lot of dry powder there that we'll reprice. We are back to this notion that, hey, we're out there competing and growing this company, we will be originating those loans as they reprice. We're not dumping assets and getting out of things. It's going to shrink the total volume that's on our book. You have the competing parts, right? We're going to have repricings of fixed rate assets fighting reprices of our liabilities. At some point, that's going to cross, and banks are going to grow NII at high percentages. I just can't tell you when that is yet, and we haven't done our budget next year. Thanks, everybody."

        "content": "Bryan Gill: Good morning, and welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of July 18, 2023, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Demchak: Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. As you can see on the slide, we delivered solid results in the second quarter generating exactly $1.5 billion in net income or $3.36 in diluted earnings per share. While the macro environment and the competitive dynamics playing out within the banking sector pressured our revenue during the quarter, our results reflect the overall strength of our franchise and balance sheet. And importantly, through it all, we remain focused on executing on our strategic priorities. Our momentum across our markets remains strong, especially in the Southwest. We are growing households and commercial customers throughout our footprint.  Rob will take you through the details of our second quarter results in a moment, but I'd like to call out a few highlights. First, we grew our capital during the quarter and feel very good about our positioning of our balance sheet in the current environment. In the next few weeks, we expect the Fed will announce changes to the Basel III capital framework. We believe our strong capital and liquidity levels, as well as our earnings power provide the strength and flexibility to address upcoming regulatory changes. At the same time, we continue to support our customers, grow our business, and deliver returns for our shareholders. And in line with our focus on shareholder returns, we recently increased our quarterly common stock dividend by $0.05. Our financial strength and stability are evidenced in the Fed's latest stress tests resulting in an improvement in our stress capital buffer to the regulatory minimum level of 2.5% in October.  Second, expense control is in focus. Rob will touch on this in a moment. We have increased our continuous improvement program target for 2023, and are taking a hard look at opportunities for even further expense improvements across the franchise.  Third, credit quality for the quarter remained strong reflecting our diversified lending franchise and our focus on developing valuable, sustainable businesses based on long term customer relationships.  And finally, I'd like to thank our employees for their efforts and contributions during the quarter.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob. \nRobert Reilly: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and we're presenting on an average basis and comparing to the first quarter. Loans were stable at $325 billion. Investment securities declined $2 billion or 2%. Cash balances at the Federal Reserve were $31 billion and decreased $3 billion, deposits of $426 billion declined $10 billion or 2%. Borrowed funds increased $3 billion. As an aside, since 2021, we've been deliberate in issuing TLAC compliant debt. So we're confident we'll meet the upcoming TLAC requirements through our normal course of funding.  At quarter end, AOCI was a negative $9.5 billion, and tangible book value was $77.80 per common share, an increase of 5% compared to the same period a year ago. We remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.5% as of June 30, 2023, which increased 30 basis points linked quarter. We returned approximately $700 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter, which included $600 million of common dividends and approximately a $100 million of share repurchases or 1.1 million shares.  And as Bill just mentioned, our Board recently approved a $0.05 increase to our quarterly cash dividend on common stock, raising the dividend to a $1.55 per share. Our recent CCAR results underscore the strength of our balance sheet. And as previously announced, our current stress capital buffer of 2.9% will improve to the regulatory minimum of 2.5% for the four quarter period beginning in October 2023. Due to the expected issuance by the Federal banking agencies of proposed rules to adjust the Basel III capital framework, share repurchase activity in the third quarter is expected to remain modest. We will continue to monitor this and may adjust share repurchase activity as appropriate.  Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Second quarter loans averaged $325 billion and increased $20 billion or 6% compared to the same period a year ago. This growth reflected strong loan demand during the back half of 2022 and our ability to capitalize on opportunities in our expanded franchise. Average loan balances were stable linked quarter as growth in consumer was offset by a decline in commercial, with commercial balances reflecting generally weaker demand.  Consumer loans grew $400 million compared to the first quarter, reflecting higher residential mortgage, credit card and auto balances. Commercial loans averaged $223 billion in the second quarter, a decline of $1 billion, as limited new production was more than offset by paydowns. Loan yields increased 28 basis points to 5.57% in the second quarter, predominantly driven by the higher rate environment.  Slide 5 covers our deposits in more detail. Deposits declined 2% on both a spot and average basis linked quarter, reflecting the continuing pressure of quantitative tightening and increased spending activity as well as consumer tax payments. Deposits continue to move from non-interest bearing to interest bearing accounts. As expected, the mix shift is being driven by commercial deposits. In the second quarter, commercial non-interest bearing deposits represented 45% of total commercial deposits compared to 47% in the first quarter. Our consumer deposit non-interest bearing mix has been stable remaining at 10%.  On a consolidated basis, our level of non-interest bearing deposits was 27% in the second quarter, down slightly from 28% in the first quarter consistent with our expectations, and we still expect the non-interest bearing portion of our deposits to stabilize in the mid 20% range.  Our rate paid on interest bearing deposits increased to 1.96% during the second quarter, up from 1.66% in the prior quarter. And as of June 30, our cumulative deposit beta was 39%.  Looking forward, we expect the Federal Reserve to raise the benchmark rate by 25 basis points in July. We believe this will put additional pressure on betas. And as a result, we expect our third quarter and year end cumulative betas to be 42% and 44% respectively.  Slide 6 details our investment securities and swap portfolios. Average investment securities of $141 billion decreased $2.4 billion or 2%, as limited purchase activity during the quarter was more than offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities. The securities portfolio yield increased 3 basis points to 2.52%, reflecting the runoff of lower yielding securities. And as of June 30, the duration of the investment securities portfolio was 4.2 years.  Our received fixed swaps pointed to the commercial loan book totaled $40 billion at the end of the second quarter. The weighted average received fixed rate of our swap portfolio increased 25 basis points linked quarter to 1.73%, and the portfolio duration was 2.3 years as of June 30.  During the second quarter, our accumulated other comprehensive loss increased by $400 million. Paydowns and maturities were in line with our expectations, but were more than offset by the negative impact from higher than expected rates throughout the quarter.  Notwithstanding this AOCI impact, our tangible book value increased 1% to $77.80 compared to March 31.  Importantly, as lower rate securities and swaps roll off, we expect our securities yields to continue to increase, resulting in a meaningful improvement to tangible book value from AOCI accretion.  Turning to the income statement on Slide 7. For the first half of 2023, revenue grew 11% compared to the same period a year ago, reflecting higher interest rates and overall business growth. Non-interest expense grew 4% and was well controlled despite a higher FDIC assessment rate and inflationary pressures. As a result, PPNR grew 24%.  For the second quarter, net income was $1.5 billion or $3.36 per share. Total revenue of $5.3 billion decreased $310 million or 6% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Net interest income declined 75 million or 2%, and our net interest margin was 2.79%, a decline of 5 basis points.  Non-interest income declined $235 million or 12%, driven by both lower fee income and other non-interest income, which included Visa fair value adjustments of a negative $83 million that I will discuss in a moment. Second quarter expenses increased $51 million or 2% linked quarter.  Provision was $146 million in the second quarter, reflecting portfolio activity and changes in macroeconomic variables, and our effective tax rate was 15.5%, which included the favorable impact of certain tax matters in the second quarter.  Turning to Slide 8, we highlight our revenue trends. Second quarter revenue was down $310 million or 6% compared with the first quarter. Net interest income of $3.5 billion decreased $75 million or 2%, with higher yields on interest earning assets were more than offset by increased funding costs and lower loan and security balances. Fee income was $1.7 billion and decreased $106 million or 6% linked quarter. The primary driver of the decline in fee income was residential and commercial mortgage revenue, which was down $79 million. Inside of that $58 million was related to lower net valuation of mortgage servicing rights. Beyond that, capital markets and advisory revenue decreased $49 million or 19% driven by lower merger and acquisition advisory fees and loan syndication revenue. Going forward, we expect this activity to meaningfully increase in the second half of the year, which is included in our guidance that I will cover in a few minutes.  Partially offsetting these declines was a $38 million or 6% increase in card and cash management fees, reflecting seasonally higher consumer transaction volumes, and increased treasury management product revenue. Other non-interest income of $129 million declined 50% linked quarter driven by lower private equity revenue and included negative Visa fair value adjustments related to litigation, escrow funding, and other valuation changes totaling $83 million.  Turning to Slide 9, our second quarter expenses were up $51 million or 2% linked quarter and remain well controlled. The growth was primarily due to a $35 million increase in marketing expense reflecting seasonality. Personnel expense increased by $20 million or 1%, which included the full quarter impact of annual employee merit increases. Every other expense category remained stable or declined compared to the first quarter of 2023.  As Bill mentioned, we remain diligent in our expense management efforts, particularly when considering the current revenue environment. At the beginning of the year, we set a continuous improvement program goal of $400 million. Recently, we've identified initiatives that support increasing our CIP by an additional $50 million, raising our full year target to $450 million.  Further, we'll continue to look for additional efficiencies during the remainder of 2023, and importantly, as we begin to plan for 2024.  Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 10, our credit quality remains strong, and notably, the leading indicators for credit quality continue to perform well. Non-performing loans were down $97 million or 5% and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans and total delinquencies of $1.2 billion decreased $114 million or 9% linked quarter. Net charge offs of $194 million were stable linked quarter. Our annualized net charge offs to average loans ratio was 24 basis points in the second quarter, and our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.4 billion or 1.7% of total loans on June 30, essentially stable with March 31.  While overall credit quality remains strong across our portfolio, the office category within commercial real estate continues to be a key area of concern. As expected, we saw increases in charge offs related to office during the quarter. However, the portfolio metrics remain largely similar to those presented in our comprehensive view last quarter. Naturally, we'll continue to monitor and review our assumptions to ensure they reflect real time market conditions and a full update is included in the appendix slides.  In summary, PNC reported a solid second quarter 2023. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we're expecting a mild recession starting in early 2024 with a contraction in real GDP of less than 1%. Our rate path assumption includes a 25 basis point increase in the Fed funds rate in July. Following that, we expect the Fed to pause rate actions until March 2024 when we expect the Fed to begin to cut rates.  Looking ahead, our outlook for the third quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2023 is as follows: We expect average loans to decline approximately 1%; net interest income to be down 3% to 4%; non-interest income to be up 10% to 11%. Taking the component pieces, we expect total revenue to be up approximately 1%. We expect total non-interest expense to be stable and we expect second quarter net charge offs to be between $200 million and $250 million.  Considering our reported operating results for the first half of 2023, third quarter expectations and current economic forecasts for the full year 2023 compared to full year 2022, we expect spot loans to be relatively stable, which equates to average loan growth of 5% to 6%; total revenue growth to be approximately 2% to 2.5%. Inside of that, our expectation is for net interest income to be in the range of up 5% to 6%. This is a move to the lower end of our previous guidance, largely driven by anticipated deposit costs moving a bit faster than we expected and slightly lower loan growth expectations.  We expect non-interest income to decline 2% to 4%, which is down from our earlier expectations of stable. This change is resulting from softer than expected capital markets revenue in the second quarter and $127 million of Visa related charges that have been incurred year-to-date. Expenses are expected to be up approximately 2%. Credit quality is trending better than expected, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18%.  And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.\nJohn Pancari : On the fee income side, if you could just maybe elaborate a little bit on your -- change in your expectation to down 2% to 4% for the year. I know it represents a change in your view on capital markets as well as the impact of Visa. But I know you indicated you expect a meaningful increase in capital markets in the back half. So maybe if you could kind of talk about what's impacting that and maybe help size it up a bit?\nRobert Reilly : Yes, sure. John, this is Rob. So in regard to our total noninterest income guidance for the full year, we did change it from stable to down 2% to 4%. Most of that -- in terms of that decline has occurred. So it's really reflective of what occurred in the second quarter in regard to capital market fees, underperforming our expectations and the Visa charge that we talked about, which is not in fees, but is it other noninterest income. Going forward, we do expect a pickup in capital markets fees, and that's in our guidance, both for the third quarter and the balance of the year. Just to give you some more color around that, we expect capital markets to get back to in the third quarter, the first quarter levels run rate that we were at and then some meaningful growth on top of that as well. And that's all in our guidance. So in short order, the decline in the guidance has already occurred, and we've blended that into the full year.\nJohn Pancari : Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then separately on the capital return side, I know you indicated that you expect buybacks trending somewhat minimal. So just pending Basel III, is that mean perhaps in that million range? Or is there another way to think about that? And then separately, maybe, Bill, if you can talk about any thought around M&A appetite, both on the nonbank side and the bank side?\nRobert Reilly : I can handle the first 1 there, I guess, in terms of the capital and then Bill, you can talk about some of the changes. Yes, no surprise there. We feel good about our capital levels. Our CET capital ratio increased 30 basis points in the quarter. So we're at 9.5. We did well on the stress test, the most recent stress test where our stress capital buffer decreased. So we're in an excess capital position. The part of that thinking was the increase in the dividend that we announced recently. As far as share repurchases, like I said, it's not a surprise. We're on pause. It's sensible to see what these new rules mean, understand the details and then build that into our capital return plan. So we're positioned for share repurchases going forward, but it's just sensible to take a pause right now.\nBill Demchak: I think on the M&A side, we continue to look, as we have done for the last several years. It's small things that might augment our client offerings, the volume of things that are being shown to us has actually probably increased. Our appetite to do them has probably decreased a little bit at the margin. Larger things are going to be kind of a function of the environment and what the regulatory landscape looks like. But all else equal, we would be interested in expanding our franchise.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Dave George with Baird.\nDavid George : Kind of a big picture question for both Bill and Rob. I wanted to get a sense as to how you're thinking about managing the balance sheet today, given where the cost of new money is relative to a year ago with loans and securities down a bit. I would guess, economics and perhaps some capital relief are driving some of that, but I'm curious as to how you're thinking about balancing spread revenue growth relative to managing the balance sheet for returns. I assume you're continuing to run the bank at the same ROE targets you always have. But I'm curious, conceptually, guys how you're thinking about that dynamic.\nBill Demchak: I think at the 10,000-foot level, our appetite to lend and support our clients isn't affected by short-term funding costs and so forth. There's -- you're seeing somewhat tepid loan growth largely because there's tepid loan demand. I think as a practical matter, there's a backlog building. A lot of our clients have been hesitant to do refinance under some hope that spreads would come back down. I don't think that's going to happen. So I think you'll see activity towards the back half of the year. But in any event, we just -- we support clients. We don't manage the balance sheet and the clients get the result of the other way. With respect to interest rates, we are as neutral as we can otherwise be. And I think what you're going to see through time as deposits move back towards historical norms in terms of noninterest-bearing moving to interest bearing, and we reached that kind of cumulative beta, that's going to be offset by swaps and securities, fixed rate assets are rolling off and repricing. And that's kind of what we target as we run the balance sheet in a neutral position right now.\nRobert Reilly : I'd just add to that is -- so we ran for many years substantially asset sensitive, and that's changed. So we're slightly asset sensitive but really neutral right now.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS.\nErika Najarian : I guess the first question here, and I just want to emphasize this and this squares with your 10-Q disclosure, you mentioned a neutrally positioned balance sheet. So as we think about that exit run rate that is implied for your guidance on net interest income of about $3.25 billion for the fourth quarter of '23. Without taking into account balance sheet growth, it sounds like if we do get the rate cuts that the market is expecting that the -- you're going to be able to stay within that range of $3.2 billion, $3.25 billion, again, excluding any assumed growth?\nRobert Reilly : Yes, that's fair. That's fair. Of course, our own plans are, as I mentioned in our opening comments that we wouldn't see rate cuts until first quarter of next year, but you're in the right neighborhood.\nErika Najarian : Got it. And -- thank you so much for all the disclosure on Slide 6. I'm wondering when do you think is the time to start thinking about adding and protecting from that downside risk with regards to maybe adding new received fixed swaps at obviously a higher floor than where they're coming off of? And what's the pricing like for those securities for those swaps rather?\nBill Demchak: Again, we are, at the moment, basically neutral to rates. So a duration of equity that's been bouncing around plus or minus half a year. So adding in this environment would be choosing to get long. Choosing to get long would basically be saying that we think the forward curve is correctively like term rates. And I'm not sure we do that, we agree with that yet, which is why you've seen security balances roll down. I think the big unknown for us and everybody is if and when the Fed pauses and then cuts rates, what actually happens to the shape of the yield curve in term rates and expectations would be you'd see a massive flattening. So I'm not sure at the moment that there's value to be had in extending duration to the extent we do, we're doing it in a very short end, you'd in fact see that in our swaps book, while balances are down, we canceled some and put some other ones on the yield, but very short dated.\nOperator: [Operator Instruction] Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.\nScott Siefers : I just wanted to ask sort of a conceptual question on deposit pricing. The pressures seem, I guess, a little bit uneven by company. I was hoping you could spend a moment discussion sort of how you think about the balance between not necessarily needing to show liquidity the way some others do, but still being bound just naturally by competitive dynamics within the footprint.\nBill Demchak: Sure. I follow the question. I mean the basic -- our deposit outflows, I guess, maybe I'll answer it this way, are largely following the expectations I think you'd see across the industry with QT. Inside of that, we try to keep our client base and price them competitively, and you're seeing that in the mix shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing and the increase in the beta. We're not out chasing, trying to do broker deposits or big CD pushes or something to boost deposits, if that's kind of where your question was going.\nRobert Reilly : But mostly protecting our core consumer -- customer and commercial customer.\nScott Siefers : Yes. No, I mean you hit on it. I guess, I probably could have worded it better. But if I look at your cumulative beta assumption is lower than some others, but it seems sort of realistic also just within the sort of confines of what you're actually experiencing. So I was just curious about how the competitive dynamic sort of weighed in there, and I think you touched on it, so I appreciate that.\nBill Demchak: I think if your base flows were higher than what was otherwise happening because of QTs, in other words, you were losing deposits at a pace. In that instance, your replacement cost is full rate.\nRobert Reilly : 100%.\nBill Demchak: And I think you're going to see that play out as earnings come out this week where you're going to see some pretty extreme differences in what's happened to funding cost. But our flows have been largely kind of following QT trend. \nRobert Reilly : Maybe a little better.\nBill Demchak: Yes.\nScott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. And I was hoping we could peel back a little more into the sort of the expected capital markets recovery. I guess as I look at from a top level, if there are sort of three big chunks in the capital markets, DCM, seems like it's sort of fine ECM, maybe is found firmer footing, but M&A is the piece that's still sort of in a logjam. I guess maybe as you think about the nuance for that recovery in the back half of the year, just what are the main drivers that you see?\nRobert Reilly : Yes, sure. Scott, this is Rob. Yes, particularly for us, the M&A piece, Harris Williams is a high percentage of our capital market fees. We're going off of pipeline. So the pipeline in our advisory businesses and largely extrapolate that the capital markets in total is up 20% over the first quarter and 6% year-over-year. And as you know, they had a pretty good second half of 2022. So we're basing it on that.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Mayo : I thought you might push a little harder on this. So your revised 2023 guidance using midpoints is for NII to be 150 basis points less, fees to be 300 basis points less and expenses only 50 basis points less. So I'm just wondering how much harder you might push on the expenses? You did mention the CIP going from $400 million to $450 million of savings this year, so I guess that helps. But are you preserving infrastructure and resources for potential growth? Is it just not that variable? Or what else can you do to get expenses more in sync with the revised lower revenue guidance. And I mean that's all recognized, and I think you're still guiding for positive operating leverage this year. It's just not as high as it once was.\nBill Demchak: Thanks for the question, Mike. The short answer is we are going to push harder on it. The practical answer is, I'm not entirely sure that the benefits of what we will be doing will show up in the run rate in '23. If you look at our costs, right? We're basically down in every category other than personnel. And we're going to have to take a hard look at where we can generate savings in this company without cutting the potential for growth and the opportunity we continue to see in our growth markets and just business activity. But we're going to look at that really hard. I'm just not sure it shows up in.\nRobert Reilly : Just in terms of the timing because there's only six months left, so actions that you take don't show up in that run rate. But we did reduce, as you pointed out, we did reduce the expectation to up 2% year-over-year. That includes the FDIC special assessment that was in there and obviously inflationary pressure. So that's pretty good, but we're not going to stop there.\nMichael Mayo : All right. Well, one follow-up then as we -- how does this set you up for 2024? I guess, is it too early to say? And just in general, you guys have been -- you and the industry, it's been about six to nine months of negative downward guidance. Is loan spreads for you guys one quarter, higher interest rates than others, capital markets a little bit this quarter. And these are factors outside of your control, at least those are. Do you think you're level-setting enough now? Are we there? Or there's still more risk to the downside than to the upside?\nBill Demchak: '24 seems so far away at the moment. But I think -- I guess what I would say is we're running the company for the long term here. We see -- we continue to see once we get through rate normalization, tremendous upside in the company, in growth through clients in our new markets. And are we at the trough now? Are we at the trough when -- with our guidance for the fourth quarter? I don't know. I don't know if you have a view on it, Rob.\nRobert Reilly : Well, I would say you sort of talked about it. I mean, the disruption has been largely driven by the rate environment and the volatility in the rate environment that not only affects our earning assets and our deposits, but also some of our interest rate-sensitive fees. So all the changes there are a function of the extraordinary change in the rates. Are we in the later innings of that? I think probably, but hard to be accurate exactly.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck : Two questions. One is I know we talked earlier about demand for loans, not that great. But I'm most -- I'm also wondering, is there a credit box widening event that -- or process we should be thinking about, given that credit quality is so good?\nBill Demchak: Probably not. Well, you've always said -- we don't change our box, yes.\nRobert Reilly : Yes. I think it issue right now it's kind of pretty straightforward. The companies who otherwise in the normal cycle would be out refinancing and perhaps increasing lines are holding off under some assumption that credit is going to get cheaper, either through rate or through spread. And so there's a backlog building. I don't -- I think we wait for that market to come to us. I don't think there's a big appetite on anyone's part to go out and go with a loss-leading price, particularly given the funding markets today. So I think it will be slow for a while until people are kind of forced into this new environment and new pricing and then you'll see growth.\nBetsy Graseck : Okay. All right. Separately, on the regulatory, I know you've said in the past that your LCR ratio is compliant no matter how you measure it. When you say no matter how you measure it, are you talking about, hey, even if you were at a GSIB standard, is that what you're referring to?\nBill Demchak: I don't know the exact quote, but we put the ratio out there for a while. And while I'm not sure the ratio this quarter would qualify for the full 100%, but it's very close. And historically, it's been over the full 100% even though we're measured at the 70% threshold. \nBetsy Graseck : Yes. No, it's much higher than anybody else we talk. So I was just wondering if that's what you were thinking about there.\nBill Demchak: Yes.\nBetsy Graseck : Okay. Last ticky-tacky thing is just on the FDIC special assessment, I'm not sure if I heard this right or not, but -- is that in your full year expense guide? Or should we be thinking about\u2026?\nRobert Reilly : Yes. No, no, no. Thanks for asking that, Betsy. So no, the FDIC assessment that I was referring to was the one that was announced last year that went into place at the beginning of this year, '23. It doesn't relate to the special assessment that's being contemplated for the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, which we expect to be finalized sometime in the second half. So our guidance does not include that.\nBetsy Graseck : And that you would be putting below the line? Is that right? \nRobert Reilly : Well, we'd be expensing it, but we need to understand what that number is.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala : I have a couple of follow-up questions. One, I think you talked about interest in expansion, I guess, as it pertains to M&A. When you talk to investors and bank management teams, it appears that there are three hurdles to that. One is, lack of policy alignment in D.C., mark-to-market purchase accounting and then the macro. Bill, if you had to rate them, which of these three is the biggest hurdle to figure a little bit of consolidation in the sector?\nRobert Reilly : I think for -- look, I think for the industry broadly, it's fair value accounting on targets where even MOEs at this point, there have to be for most banks that would get together a fairly substantial capital raise. And that's going to stop people from doing things. I think you've heard quite loudly coming out of D.C. recognition that there's going to need to be consolidation in the industry to create competition against some of the giant banks. So I don't know that, that shows up largely on a hurdle. And the final thing is just the franchise value of what you might look at. It's -- people used to do deals just for size. I think we're in an environment in a credit environment where that can be dangerous because I think there's a lot of bad balance sheets out there, heavy real estate concentration and other things that would be a red flag.\nBill Demchak: But the mark-to-market is the primary challenge.\nEbrahim Poonawala : Got it. And I guess no way to resolve that the lower rates at some point. And just as a follow-up on interest rates and your deposit beta guidance. It all feels incremental well within control. If the Fed is close to being done, do you see a big risk of deposit behavior shifting back book repricing down the road? Or if the Fed is actually done, we're getting close to the end game error.\nBill Demchak: So a couple of things. I want to go back to your comment on -- just quickly on we've got to wait for rates to go lower. You don't necessarily need rates to go lower. You need the existing book to pull the par, right? One of the -- so for example, our securities book because of short duration will pull the par very quickly. Others, some have long book, some have short books, so it will vary across the industry. The issue of deposit betas, if the Fed just freezes and stays there for a long period of time, you would have deposit beta creep. We're at the margin, there would be competition for deposits as long as Q2 was ongoing. And you'd see some bleed to the upside. I don't know how large that would be. It's -- we're kind of assuming some of that in our guidance. But I think that's a real issue, and we've seen it in past history when the Fed was done.\nRobert Reilly : And particularly in the interest-bearing consumer deposits which could still go up even though the Fed stop or cut.\nOperator: And our last question in the queue is a follow-up question coming from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Mayo : Hey, Bill, just your big picture perspective. So are we going into a recession, soft landing, no landing, hard landing. And remind us your reserves are predicated on unemployment of a certain level? And at what theoretical point would you say, \"Hey, it's okay for us to release some of those reserves?\"\nBill Demchak: Well, I'll give you the official Rob answer, which is we are appropriately reserved.\nMichael Mayo : Well, thank you for doing that for me.\nBill Demchak: We're -- at this point, I think we have our unemployment assumptions somewhere over 5%, which bluntly looks like it's going to be pretty tough to get there in my own view. I think the soft landing feels right, and we'll reflect on that as time comes. We're not even in a soft landing. I'd remind you that a large amount of the reserves we have appropriately are focused towards commercial real estate office specifically. And I think even with the soft landing, that asset category is going to have trouble.\nMichael Mayo : Okay. And did you make any changes? Where are you right now in the commercial -- the office reserving because I know you were kind of high in the industry before. \nRobert Reilly : Yes, we're 7.4% on the office book.\nBill Demchak: But we're over 10 on the\u2026\nRobert Reilly : I'm sorry, on the -- so the office book, inside of the office book, the multi-tenant piece, which is where we have the biggest concern is close to 11%.\nBill Demchak: So I think we're reserved for whatever happens in that book, but that's -- we'll need those reserves because we do think there's going to be problems in the office space. \nOperator: We have no further questions.\nBryan Gill : Thank you all for your participation on the call. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to the IR team.\nBill Demchak : Thanks, everybody.\nRobert Reilly : Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Robert Reilly",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and we're presenting on an average basis and comparing to the first quarter. Loans were stable at $325 billion. Investment securities declined $2 billion or 2%. Cash balances at the Federal Reserve were $31 billion and decreased $3 billion, deposits of $426 billion declined $10 billion or 2%. Borrowed funds increased $3 billion. As an aside, since 2021, we've been deliberate in issuing TLAC compliant debt. So we're confident we'll meet the upcoming TLAC requirements through our normal course of funding.  At quarter end, AOCI was a negative $9.5 billion, and tangible book value was $77.80 per common share, an increase of 5% compared to the same period a year ago. We remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.5% as of June 30, 2023, which increased 30 basis points linked quarter. We returned approximately $700 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter, which included $600 million of common dividends and approximately a $100 million of share repurchases or 1.1 million shares.  And as Bill just mentioned, our Board recently approved a $0.05 increase to our quarterly cash dividend on common stock, raising the dividend to a $1.55 per share. Our recent CCAR results underscore the strength of our balance sheet. And as previously announced, our current stress capital buffer of 2.9% will improve to the regulatory minimum of 2.5% for the four quarter period beginning in October 2023. Due to the expected issuance by the Federal banking agencies of proposed rules to adjust the Basel III capital framework, share repurchase activity in the third quarter is expected to remain modest. We will continue to monitor this and may adjust share repurchase activity as appropriate.  Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Second quarter loans averaged $325 billion and increased $20 billion or 6% compared to the same period a year ago. This growth reflected strong loan demand during the back half of 2022 and our ability to capitalize on opportunities in our expanded franchise. Average loan balances were stable linked quarter as growth in consumer was offset by a decline in commercial, with commercial balances reflecting generally weaker demand.  Consumer loans grew $400 million compared to the first quarter, reflecting higher residential mortgage, credit card and auto balances. Commercial loans averaged $223 billion in the second quarter, a decline of $1 billion, as limited new production was more than offset by paydowns. Loan yields increased 28 basis points to 5.57% in the second quarter, predominantly driven by the higher rate environment.  Slide 5 covers our deposits in more detail. Deposits declined 2% on both a spot and average basis linked quarter, reflecting the continuing pressure of quantitative tightening and increased spending activity as well as consumer tax payments. Deposits continue to move from non-interest bearing to interest bearing accounts. As expected, the mix shift is being driven by commercial deposits. In the second quarter, commercial non-interest bearing deposits represented 45% of total commercial deposits compared to 47% in the first quarter. Our consumer deposit non-interest bearing mix has been stable remaining at 10%.  On a consolidated basis, our level of non-interest bearing deposits was 27% in the second quarter, down slightly from 28% in the first quarter consistent with our expectations, and we still expect the non-interest bearing portion of our deposits to stabilize in the mid 20% range.  Our rate paid on interest bearing deposits increased to 1.96% during the second quarter, up from 1.66% in the prior quarter. And as of June 30, our cumulative deposit beta was 39%.  Looking forward, we expect the Federal Reserve to raise the benchmark rate by 25 basis points in July. We believe this will put additional pressure on betas. And as a result, we expect our third quarter and year end cumulative betas to be 42% and 44% respectively.  Slide 6 details our investment securities and swap portfolios. Average investment securities of $141 billion decreased $2.4 billion or 2%, as limited purchase activity during the quarter was more than offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities. The securities portfolio yield increased 3 basis points to 2.52%, reflecting the runoff of lower yielding securities. And as of June 30, the duration of the investment securities portfolio was 4.2 years.  Our received fixed swaps pointed to the commercial loan book totaled $40 billion at the end of the second quarter. The weighted average received fixed rate of our swap portfolio increased 25 basis points linked quarter to 1.73%, and the portfolio duration was 2.3 years as of June 30.  During the second quarter, our accumulated other comprehensive loss increased by $400 million. Paydowns and maturities were in line with our expectations, but were more than offset by the negative impact from higher than expected rates throughout the quarter.  Notwithstanding this AOCI impact, our tangible book value increased 1% to $77.80 compared to March 31.  Importantly, as lower rate securities and swaps roll off, we expect our securities yields to continue to increase, resulting in a meaningful improvement to tangible book value from AOCI accretion.  Turning to the income statement on Slide 7. For the first half of 2023, revenue grew 11% compared to the same period a year ago, reflecting higher interest rates and overall business growth. Non-interest expense grew 4% and was well controlled despite a higher FDIC assessment rate and inflationary pressures. As a result, PPNR grew 24%.  For the second quarter, net income was $1.5 billion or $3.36 per share. Total revenue of $5.3 billion decreased $310 million or 6% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Net interest income declined 75 million or 2%, and our net interest margin was 2.79%, a decline of 5 basis points.  Non-interest income declined $235 million or 12%, driven by both lower fee income and other non-interest income, which included Visa fair value adjustments of a negative $83 million that I will discuss in a moment. Second quarter expenses increased $51 million or 2% linked quarter.  Provision was $146 million in the second quarter, reflecting portfolio activity and changes in macroeconomic variables, and our effective tax rate was 15.5%, which included the favorable impact of certain tax matters in the second quarter.  Turning to Slide 8, we highlight our revenue trends. Second quarter revenue was down $310 million or 6% compared with the first quarter. Net interest income of $3.5 billion decreased $75 million or 2%, with higher yields on interest earning assets were more than offset by increased funding costs and lower loan and security balances. Fee income was $1.7 billion and decreased $106 million or 6% linked quarter. The primary driver of the decline in fee income was residential and commercial mortgage revenue, which was down $79 million. Inside of that $58 million was related to lower net valuation of mortgage servicing rights. Beyond that, capital markets and advisory revenue decreased $49 million or 19% driven by lower merger and acquisition advisory fees and loan syndication revenue. Going forward, we expect this activity to meaningfully increase in the second half of the year, which is included in our guidance that I will cover in a few minutes.  Partially offsetting these declines was a $38 million or 6% increase in card and cash management fees, reflecting seasonally higher consumer transaction volumes, and increased treasury management product revenue. Other non-interest income of $129 million declined 50% linked quarter driven by lower private equity revenue and included negative Visa fair value adjustments related to litigation, escrow funding, and other valuation changes totaling $83 million.  Turning to Slide 9, our second quarter expenses were up $51 million or 2% linked quarter and remain well controlled. The growth was primarily due to a $35 million increase in marketing expense reflecting seasonality. Personnel expense increased by $20 million or 1%, which included the full quarter impact of annual employee merit increases. Every other expense category remained stable or declined compared to the first quarter of 2023.  As Bill mentioned, we remain diligent in our expense management efforts, particularly when considering the current revenue environment. At the beginning of the year, we set a continuous improvement program goal of $400 million. Recently, we've identified initiatives that support increasing our CIP by an additional $50 million, raising our full year target to $450 million.  Further, we'll continue to look for additional efficiencies during the remainder of 2023, and importantly, as we begin to plan for 2024.  Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 10, our credit quality remains strong, and notably, the leading indicators for credit quality continue to perform well. Non-performing loans were down $97 million or 5% and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans and total delinquencies of $1.2 billion decreased $114 million or 9% linked quarter. Net charge offs of $194 million were stable linked quarter. Our annualized net charge offs to average loans ratio was 24 basis points in the second quarter, and our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.4 billion or 1.7% of total loans on June 30, essentially stable with March 31.  While overall credit quality remains strong across our portfolio, the office category within commercial real estate continues to be a key area of concern. As expected, we saw increases in charge offs related to office during the quarter. However, the portfolio metrics remain largely similar to those presented in our comprehensive view last quarter. Naturally, we'll continue to monitor and review our assumptions to ensure they reflect real time market conditions and a full update is included in the appendix slides.  In summary, PNC reported a solid second quarter 2023. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we're expecting a mild recession starting in early 2024 with a contraction in real GDP of less than 1%. Our rate path assumption includes a 25 basis point increase in the Fed funds rate in July. Following that, we expect the Fed to pause rate actions until March 2024 when we expect the Fed to begin to cut rates.  Looking ahead, our outlook for the third quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2023 is as follows: We expect average loans to decline approximately 1%; net interest income to be down 3% to 4%; non-interest income to be up 10% to 11%. Taking the component pieces, we expect total revenue to be up approximately 1%. We expect total non-interest expense to be stable and we expect second quarter net charge offs to be between $200 million and $250 million.  Considering our reported operating results for the first half of 2023, third quarter expectations and current economic forecasts for the full year 2023 compared to full year 2022, we expect spot loans to be relatively stable, which equates to average loan growth of 5% to 6%; total revenue growth to be approximately 2% to 2.5%. Inside of that, our expectation is for net interest income to be in the range of up 5% to 6%. This is a move to the lower end of our previous guidance, largely driven by anticipated deposit costs moving a bit faster than we expected and slightly lower loan growth expectations.  We expect non-interest income to decline 2% to 4%, which is down from our earlier expectations of stable. This change is resulting from softer than expected capital markets revenue in the second quarter and $127 million of Visa related charges that have been incurred year-to-date. Expenses are expected to be up approximately 2%. Credit quality is trending better than expected, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18%.  And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions. Yes, sure. John, this is Rob. So in regard to our total noninterest income guidance for the full year, we did change it from stable to down 2% to 4%. Most of that -- in terms of that decline has occurred. So it's really reflective of what occurred in the second quarter in regard to capital market fees, underperforming our expectations and the Visa charge that we talked about, which is not in fees, but is it other noninterest income. Going forward, we do expect a pickup in capital markets fees, and that's in our guidance, both for the third quarter and the balance of the year. Just to give you some more color around that, we expect capital markets to get back to in the third quarter, the first quarter levels run rate that we were at and then some meaningful growth on top of that as well. And that's all in our guidance. So in short order, the decline in the guidance has already occurred, and we've blended that into the full year. I can handle the first 1 there, I guess, in terms of the capital and then Bill, you can talk about some of the changes. Yes, no surprise there. We feel good about our capital levels. Our CET capital ratio increased 30 basis points in the quarter. So we're at 9.5. We did well on the stress test, the most recent stress test where our stress capital buffer decreased. So we're in an excess capital position. The part of that thinking was the increase in the dividend that we announced recently. As far as share repurchases, like I said, it's not a surprise. We're on pause. It's sensible to see what these new rules mean, understand the details and then build that into our capital return plan. So we're positioned for share repurchases going forward, but it's just sensible to take a pause right now. I'd just add to that is -- so we ran for many years substantially asset sensitive, and that's changed. So we're slightly asset sensitive but really neutral right now. Yes, that's fair. That's fair. Of course, our own plans are, as I mentioned in our opening comments that we wouldn't see rate cuts until first quarter of next year, but you're in the right neighborhood. But mostly protecting our core consumer -- customer and commercial customer. 100%. Maybe a little better. Yes, sure. Scott, this is Rob. Yes, particularly for us, the M&A piece, Harris Williams is a high percentage of our capital market fees. We're going off of pipeline. So the pipeline in our advisory businesses and largely extrapolate that the capital markets in total is up 20% over the first quarter and 6% year-over-year. And as you know, they had a pretty good second half of 2022. So we're basing it on that. Just in terms of the timing because there's only six months left, so actions that you take don't show up in that run rate. But we did reduce, as you pointed out, we did reduce the expectation to up 2% year-over-year. That includes the FDIC special assessment that was in there and obviously inflationary pressure. So that's pretty good, but we're not going to stop there. Well, I would say you sort of talked about it. I mean, the disruption has been largely driven by the rate environment and the volatility in the rate environment that not only affects our earning assets and our deposits, but also some of our interest rate-sensitive fees. So all the changes there are a function of the extraordinary change in the rates. Are we in the later innings of that? I think probably, but hard to be accurate exactly. Yes. I think it issue right now it's kind of pretty straightforward. The companies who otherwise in the normal cycle would be out refinancing and perhaps increasing lines are holding off under some assumption that credit is going to get cheaper, either through rate or through spread. And so there's a backlog building. I don't -- I think we wait for that market to come to us. I don't think there's a big appetite on anyone's part to go out and go with a loss-leading price, particularly given the funding markets today. So I think it will be slow for a while until people are kind of forced into this new environment and new pricing and then you'll see growth. Yes. No, no, no. Thanks for asking that, Betsy. So no, the FDIC assessment that I was referring to was the one that was announced last year that went into place at the beginning of this year, '23. It doesn't relate to the special assessment that's being contemplated for the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, which we expect to be finalized sometime in the second half. So our guidance does not include that. Well, we'd be expensing it, but we need to understand what that number is. I think for -- look, I think for the industry broadly, it's fair value accounting on targets where even MOEs at this point, there have to be for most banks that would get together a fairly substantial capital raise. And that's going to stop people from doing things. I think you've heard quite loudly coming out of D.C. recognition that there's going to need to be consolidation in the industry to create competition against some of the giant banks. So I don't know that, that shows up largely on a hurdle. And the final thing is just the franchise value of what you might look at. It's -- people used to do deals just for size. I think we're in an environment in a credit environment where that can be dangerous because I think there's a lot of bad balance sheets out there, heavy real estate concentration and other things that would be a red flag. And particularly in the interest-bearing consumer deposits which could still go up even though the Fed stop or cut. Yes, we're 7.4% on the office book. I'm sorry, on the -- so the office book, inside of the office book, the multi-tenant piece, which is where we have the biggest concern is close to 11%. Thank you."

            "name": "Bill Demchak",
            "content": "Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. As you can see on the slide, we delivered solid results in the second quarter generating exactly $1.5 billion in net income or $3.36 in diluted earnings per share. While the macro environment and the competitive dynamics playing out within the banking sector pressured our revenue during the quarter, our results reflect the overall strength of our franchise and balance sheet. And importantly, through it all, we remain focused on executing on our strategic priorities. Our momentum across our markets remains strong, especially in the Southwest. We are growing households and commercial customers throughout our footprint.  Rob will take you through the details of our second quarter results in a moment, but I'd like to call out a few highlights. First, we grew our capital during the quarter and feel very good about our positioning of our balance sheet in the current environment. In the next few weeks, we expect the Fed will announce changes to the Basel III capital framework. We believe our strong capital and liquidity levels, as well as our earnings power provide the strength and flexibility to address upcoming regulatory changes. At the same time, we continue to support our customers, grow our business, and deliver returns for our shareholders. And in line with our focus on shareholder returns, we recently increased our quarterly common stock dividend by $0.05. Our financial strength and stability are evidenced in the Fed's latest stress tests resulting in an improvement in our stress capital buffer to the regulatory minimum level of 2.5% in October.  Second, expense control is in focus. Rob will touch on this in a moment. We have increased our continuous improvement program target for 2023, and are taking a hard look at opportunities for even further expense improvements across the franchise.  Third, credit quality for the quarter remained strong reflecting our diversified lending franchise and our focus on developing valuable, sustainable businesses based on long term customer relationships.  And finally, I'd like to thank our employees for their efforts and contributions during the quarter.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob. I think on the M&A side, we continue to look, as we have done for the last several years. It's small things that might augment our client offerings, the volume of things that are being shown to us has actually probably increased. Our appetite to do them has probably decreased a little bit at the margin. Larger things are going to be kind of a function of the environment and what the regulatory landscape looks like. But all else equal, we would be interested in expanding our franchise. I think at the 10,000-foot level, our appetite to lend and support our clients isn't affected by short-term funding costs and so forth. There's -- you're seeing somewhat tepid loan growth largely because there's tepid loan demand. I think as a practical matter, there's a backlog building. A lot of our clients have been hesitant to do refinance under some hope that spreads would come back down. I don't think that's going to happen. So I think you'll see activity towards the back half of the year. But in any event, we just -- we support clients. We don't manage the balance sheet and the clients get the result of the other way. With respect to interest rates, we are as neutral as we can otherwise be. And I think what you're going to see through time as deposits move back towards historical norms in terms of noninterest-bearing moving to interest bearing, and we reached that kind of cumulative beta, that's going to be offset by swaps and securities, fixed rate assets are rolling off and repricing. And that's kind of what we target as we run the balance sheet in a neutral position right now. Again, we are, at the moment, basically neutral to rates. So a duration of equity that's been bouncing around plus or minus half a year. So adding in this environment would be choosing to get long. Choosing to get long would basically be saying that we think the forward curve is correctively like term rates. And I'm not sure we do that, we agree with that yet, which is why you've seen security balances roll down. I think the big unknown for us and everybody is if and when the Fed pauses and then cuts rates, what actually happens to the shape of the yield curve in term rates and expectations would be you'd see a massive flattening. So I'm not sure at the moment that there's value to be had in extending duration to the extent we do, we're doing it in a very short end, you'd in fact see that in our swaps book, while balances are down, we canceled some and put some other ones on the yield, but very short dated. Sure. I follow the question. I mean the basic -- our deposit outflows, I guess, maybe I'll answer it this way, are largely following the expectations I think you'd see across the industry with QT. Inside of that, we try to keep our client base and price them competitively, and you're seeing that in the mix shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing and the increase in the beta. We're not out chasing, trying to do broker deposits or big CD pushes or something to boost deposits, if that's kind of where your question was going. I think if your base flows were higher than what was otherwise happening because of QTs, in other words, you were losing deposits at a pace. In that instance, your replacement cost is full rate. And I think you're going to see that play out as earnings come out this week where you're going to see some pretty extreme differences in what's happened to funding cost. But our flows have been largely kind of following QT trend. Yes. Thanks for the question, Mike. The short answer is we are going to push harder on it. The practical answer is, I'm not entirely sure that the benefits of what we will be doing will show up in the run rate in '23. If you look at our costs, right? We're basically down in every category other than personnel. And we're going to have to take a hard look at where we can generate savings in this company without cutting the potential for growth and the opportunity we continue to see in our growth markets and just business activity. But we're going to look at that really hard. I'm just not sure it shows up in. '24 seems so far away at the moment. But I think -- I guess what I would say is we're running the company for the long term here. We see -- we continue to see once we get through rate normalization, tremendous upside in the company, in growth through clients in our new markets. And are we at the trough now? Are we at the trough when -- with our guidance for the fourth quarter? I don't know. I don't know if you have a view on it, Rob. Probably not. Well, you've always said -- we don't change our box, yes. I don't know the exact quote, but we put the ratio out there for a while. And while I'm not sure the ratio this quarter would qualify for the full 100%, but it's very close. And historically, it's been over the full 100% even though we're measured at the 70% threshold. Yes. But the mark-to-market is the primary challenge. So a couple of things. I want to go back to your comment on -- just quickly on we've got to wait for rates to go lower. You don't necessarily need rates to go lower. You need the existing book to pull the par, right? One of the -- so for example, our securities book because of short duration will pull the par very quickly. Others, some have long book, some have short books, so it will vary across the industry. The issue of deposit betas, if the Fed just freezes and stays there for a long period of time, you would have deposit beta creep. We're at the margin, there would be competition for deposits as long as Q2 was ongoing. And you'd see some bleed to the upside. I don't know how large that would be. It's -- we're kind of assuming some of that in our guidance. But I think that's a real issue, and we've seen it in past history when the Fed was done. Well, I'll give you the official Rob answer, which is we are appropriately reserved. We're -- at this point, I think we have our unemployment assumptions somewhere over 5%, which bluntly looks like it's going to be pretty tough to get there in my own view. I think the soft landing feels right, and we'll reflect on that as time comes. We're not even in a soft landing. I'd remind you that a large amount of the reserves we have appropriately are focused towards commercial real estate office specifically. And I think even with the soft landing, that asset category is going to have trouble. But we're over 10 on the... So I think we're reserved for whatever happens in that book, but that's -- we'll need those reserves because we do think there's going to be problems in the office space. Thanks, everybody."

Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of April 14, 2023, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\nWilliam Demchak: Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you can see on the slide, our quarterly results were strong, and we reported $1.7 billion in net income or $3.98 per share. Inside of this, we grew deposits and loans, increased our capital and liquidity positions generated positive operating leverage and maintain strong credit quality. For the past month, we've seen market volatility across the broader industry. And while we take this situation seriously and are closely monitoring the environment, it's important to note that these events have taken place within a few banks with very unique business models. Inside of our company, we really haven't seen any meaningful impacts from the events of the past month. Our balance sheet remains strong and stable, and we are operating the company in the same way we were at the beginning of March. Ultimately, over time, we expect the dynamics playing out in the banking system today to contribute to changes in the competitive landscape. And while it's still early innings, we believe that PNC will be a beneficiary from this process. That said, in the near term, we're not immune to the competitive environment and the deposit dynamics that will ultimately impact our NII in the near term, and Rob is going to cover that in more detail in a second. We remain focused on growing relationships across our lines of business, and we continue to execute on key priorities, including the expansion in the BBVA legacy markets. Rob will provide more details on our financial performance in a moment. However, for this particular call, he'll review our first quarter earnings in a slightly condensed manner to allow time to also cover key balance sheet focus points that have been top of mind for our investors in the last couple of weeks. And of course, following that, we'll be able to discuss your specific questions in the Q&A segment. Finally, I'd like to thank our 61,000 employees for helping deliver a strong quarter and everything they do to support our customers. Now with that, I'll turn it over to Rob.\nRobert Reilly : Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. Loans for the first quarter were $326 billion, an increase of $3.6 billion or 1% linked quarter. Investment securities were relatively stable at $143 billion. Cash balances at the Federal Reserve averaged $34 billion and increased $4 billion during the quarter. Deposits of $436 billion grew on both a spot and average basis linked quarter. Average borrowed funds increased $4 billion, which reflected fourth quarter 2022 activity as well as senior note issuances in January of this year. At quarter end, our tangible book value was $76.90 per common share, an increase of 7% linked quarter and we remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.2% as of March 31, 2023. During the quarter, we returned $1 billion of capital to shareholders which included $600 million of common dividends and approximately $370 million of share repurchases or 2.4 million shares. Due to market conditions and increased economic uncertainty, we expect to reduce our share repurchase activity in the second quarter. And of course, we'll continue to monitor this and may adjust share repurchase activity as appropriate. Slide 5 shows our loans and deposits in more detail. During the first quarter, loan balances averaged $326 billion, an increase of $4 billion or 1%, largely reflecting the full quarter impact of growth in the fourth quarter of 2022. Deposits averaged $436 billion in the first quarter, increasing $1.3 billion. We continue to see a mix shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing, and I will cover that in more detail in a few minutes. Our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits has increased to 1.6% during the first quarter from 1.07% in the fourth quarter of 2022. And as of March 31, our cumulative deposit beta was 35%. Turning to the income statement on Slide 6. As you can see, first quarter 2023 reported net income was $1.7 billion, or $3.98 per share. Total revenues of $5.6 billion decreased to $160 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Net interest income decreased $99 million or 3% primarily driven by 2 fewer days in the quarter and higher funding costs, partially offset by higher yields on interest-earning assets. Our net interest margin of 2.84%, declined 8 basis points reflecting the increased funding costs, I just mentioned. Noninterest income also declined 3% or $61 million as growth in asset management and brokerage was more than offset by a general slowdown in capital markets activity as well as seasonally lower consumer transaction volumes. First quarter expenses declined $153 million or 4% linked quarter, even after accounting for the increase to the FDIC's deposit assessment rate which equated to $25 million. Provision was $235 million in the first quarter and included the impact of updated economic assumptions as well as changes in portfolio composition and quality. And our effective tax rate was 17.2%. Turning to Slide 7. We highlight our revenue and expense trends. As a result of our diversified revenue streams and expense management efforts, we generated positive operating leverage of 2% linked quarter and 15% compared to the same period a year ago. And as we previously stated, we have a goal to reduce costs by $400 million in 2023 through our continuous improvement program, and we're confident we will achieve our full year target. And as you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 8. Nonperforming loans remained stable at $2 billion and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies of $1.3 billion declined $164 million or 11% linked quarter. Notably, the delinquency rate of 41 basis points is our lowest level in over a decade. Net charge-offs were $195 million, a decrease of $29 million linked quarter. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans ratio was 24 basis points in the first quarter and our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.4 billion or 1.7% of total loans on March 31, essentially stable with year-end 2022. Before I provide an update on our forward guidance, as Bill mentioned, we want to take a deeper dive into some of the key balance sheet items that are top of mind in the current environment related to deposits, securities and swaps, capital and liquidity and the impact of potential regulatory changes. And finally, office exposure within our commercial portfolio. In our view, we believe we're well positioned across all these key areas of focus. Turning to Slide 10. Our $437 billion deposit base is broken down between consumer and commercial categories to give you a view of the composition and granularity of the portfolio. At the end of the first quarter, our deposits were 53% consumer and 47% commercial. Inside of our $230 billion of consumer deposits, approximately 90% are FDIC insured. The portfolio is very granular with an average account balance of approximately $11,500 across nearly 20 million accounts throughout our coast-to-coast franchise. Our $207 billion of commercial deposits are 20% insured, but importantly, approximately 95% of the total balances are held in operating and relationship accounts. These include deposits held as compensating balances to pay for treasury management fees, escrow deposits at Meadowlands loan services and broader relationship accounts, all of which tend to provide more stability than deposit-only accounts. Importantly, we have approximately 1.4 million commercial deposit accounts, representing a diverse set of industries and geographies. Turning to Slide 11. We highlight our mix of noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits. Our consumer deposits, noninterest-bearing mix has been stable, remaining at 10% compared to the same period a year ago. The commercial side is where we expected to see a continued shift from noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing deposits as rates have risen and that has played out, albeit at a somewhat faster pace than we had expected. The commercial noninterest-bearing portion of total deposits was 45% as of March 31, down from 58% a year ago. Importantly, commercial noninterest-bearing include the compensating balances and Meadowlands deposits, I mentioned previously, which provides support to this mix through time. On a consolidated basis, our level of noninterest-bearing deposits was 27% at the end of the first quarter of 2023, down from 33% a year ago. PNC has historically operated with a higher percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits relative to the banking industry due in part to the strength of our treasury management business and granular deposit base. As a result, we expect our noninterest-bearing portion of deposits to continue to exceed industry averages, and approach the mid-20% range by year-end 2023. In addition to our mix shift, we have seen a faster increase in our deposit cost this year as the Federal Reserve has continued to raise short-term interest rates. Slide 12 shows our recent trends and our current expectations for deposit betas through the end of 2023. The increase in our current deposit beta expectations are largely driven by recent events that have increased the intensity and focus on rates paid and ultimately, has added incremental pricing pressure sooner than we previously expected. We expect the Federal Reserve to raise the benchmark rate by 25 basis points in May. This, coupled with heightened competition for deposits, has accelerated our expectations to the level and pace of beta increase and we now expect to reach a terminal beta of 42% by year-end. Slide 13 details our investment securities and swap portfolios. Our securities balance averaged $143 billion in the first quarter and were relatively stable linked quarter. The yield on our securities portfolio increased 13 basis points to 2.49%, as we continue to replace runoff at higher reinvestment rates. Yields on new purchases during the quarter exceeded 4.75%. Our portfolio is high quality and positioned with a short duration of 4.3 years, meaningfully shorter than many of our peers. Approximately 2/3 of our securities are recorded as held to maturity and 1/3 is available for sale. Average security balances represent approximately 28% of interest-earning assets. Our received fixed swaps pointed to the commercial loan book remained largely stable at $42 billion in notional value and 2.25-year duration. At the end of the first quarter, our accumulated other comprehensive loss improved by $1.1 billion or 10% to $9.1 billion, driven by the impact of lower interest rates during the quarter and normal accretion as the securities and swaps pulled apart. Slide 14 highlights the pace of expected security and swap maturities as well as the related AOCI runoff. By the end of 2024, we expect about 26% of our securities and swaps to roll off. This will drive increases in our securities and commercial loan yields as well as meaningful tangible book value improvement as we expect approximately 40% AOCI accretion by the end of year 2024. Slide 15 highlights our strong liquidity position. Our strong liquidity coverage ratios continued to improve in the first quarter and exceeded regulatory requirements throughout the quarter. Our cash balance is at the Federal Reserve totaled $34 billion, and we maintained substantial unused borrowing capacity and flexibility through other funding sources. includes a required statutory daily liquidity coverage ratio assessment as well as a monthly net stable funding ratio calculation. In addition, we performed monthly internal liquidity stress testing that covers a range of time horizons as well as systemic and idiosyncratic stress scenarios. Our mix of borrowed funds to total liabilities has historically averaged approximately 17% and reached an unprecedented low level of 6% in 2021. On March 31, our mix was 12% and we expect to move closer to the historical average over time. In light of the current environment, we anticipate that we will be subject to a total loss absorbing capacity requirement in some form and at some point, with a reasonable phase-in period. Importantly, as our borrowed funds continue to return to a more normalized level, we would expect to be compliant through our current issuance plans under existing TLAC requirements. Slide 16 shows our solid capital position with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.2% at quarter end. As a Category 3 institution, we don't include AOCI in our CET1 ratio, but I understand why there is focus on this ratio with the inclusion of AOCI. As of March 31, 2023, our CET1 ratio, including AOCI, was estimated to be 7.5%, which remains above our 7.4% required level, taking into account our current stress capital buffer. However, we also believe it's important to take a look at the balance sheet positioning of the bank from a market value of equity perspective. similar to our understanding of Basel IRRBB rules. Market value of equity doesn't truly get reflected on the balance sheet today due to generally accepted accounting principles, which results in a skewed approach about valuing certain items primary on the asset side. While AOCI take into account the current valuation of the securities and certain portions of our swap portfolios, it does not account for the valuation of the deposit book which can be a meaningful offset in a rising interest rate environment. In fact, looking at PNC's change in market value of equity over the past year, the increase in the market value of our deposits and the rapidly rising interest rate environment has significantly outpaced all unrealized losses on the asset side of the balance sheet, including securities and fixed rate loans. Total market value of equity increased substantially in the rising rate environment, and further, our duration of equity is now essentially 0 and well positioned in the current environment. Importantly, our models use conservative assumptions regarding estimates for betas, mix, balances, we also recognized early on that large inflows of deposits during the pandemic were driven by a combination of QE and fiscal stimulus, which were likely to be short-lived. Recall our Fed balances peaked in the first quarter of 2021 around $86 billion. As a result, we modeled an economic value associated with those deposits at a fraction of the value of core deposits. Turning to Slide 17. I I wanted to spend a few minutes talking about our commercial real estate portfolio. While credit quality is strong across the majority of our CRE book, office is a segment receiving a lot of attention in this environment due to the shift to remote work and higher interest rates. So we thought it would be worthwhile to highlight our exposure and our position with this portfolio. At the end of the first quarter, we had $8.9 billion or 2.7% of our total loans in our office portfolio. Turning to Slide 18. You can see the composition of this portfolio, which is well diversified across geography, tenant type and property classification. Reserves against these loans, which we have built over several quarters, now totaled 7.1%, a level that we believe adequately covers expected losses. In regard to our underwriting approach, we adhere to conservative standards, focused on attractive markets and work with experienced well [indiscernible]. The office portfolio was originated with an approximate loan to value of 55% to 60% and a significant majority of those properties are defined as Class A. We have a highly experienced team that is reviewing each asset in the portfolio to set appropriate action plans and test reserve adequacy. We don't solely rely on third-party appraisals, which will naturally be slow to adjust to the rapidly shifting market conditions. Rather, we are stress testing property performance to set realistic expectations. To appropriately [sensitize] our portfolio, we significantly discounted net operating income levels and property values across the entire office book. Additionally, tenant retention, build-out costs and concession levels are all updated to accurately reflect market conditions. Credit quality in our office portfolio remains strong today with only 0.2% of loans delinquent, 3.5% nonperforming and a net charge-off rate of 47 basis points over the last 12 months. Along those lines, we continue to see solid performance within the single tenant, medical and government loans, which represent 40% of our total office portfolio. These have occupancy levels above 90% and watch list levels of 3% or less. Where we do see increasing stress and a rising level of criticized assets, is in our multi-tenant loans, which represents 58% of our office portfolio. Multi-tenant loans are currently running in the mid-70% occupancy range. watchless levels are greater than 30% and and 60% of the portfolio is scheduled to mature by the end of 2024. In the near, this is our primary concern area as it relates to expected losses and by extension, comprises the largest portion of our office reserves. Multi-tenant reserves on a stand-alone basis are 9.4%. Obviously, we'll continue to monitor and review our assumptions to ensure they reflect real-time market conditions. For each of the key areas of focus, I just discussed, we believe we are well positioned. And Slide 9 summarizes our balance sheet strength during this volatile time. Our deposits are up, our capital and liquidity positions are strong, and our overall credit quality is solid. In summary, PNC reported a strong first quarter '23. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we are expecting a recession starting in the second half of 2023, resulting in a 1% decline in real GDP. Our rate path assumption includes a 25 basis point increase in the Fed funds rate in May. Following that, we expect the Fed to pause rate actions until early 2024, when we expect a 25 basis point cut. Looking ahead, our outlook for full year 2023 compared to 2022 results is as follows: We expect spot loan growth of 1% to 3%, which equates to average loan growth of 5% to 7%. Total revenue growth to be up 4% to 5%. Inside of that, our expectation is for net interest income to be up 6% to 8%. At this point, visibility remains challenging, and our full year NII guidance assumes the continuation of the recent intensity on deposit pricing, which is being driven by recent events. We expect noninterest income to be stable, expenses to be up 2% to 3%, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. Based on this guidance, we expect we will generate positive operating leverage in 2023. Looking at the second quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2023, we expect average loans to be stable, net interest income to be down 2% to 4%, fee income to be stable to down 1%. Other noninterest income to be between $200 million and $250 million excluding net securities and Visa activity. Taking all the component pieces, we expect total revenue to decline approximately 3%. We expect total noninterest expense to be up 1% to 2%, and we expect second quarter net charge-offs to be between $200 million and $250 million. Further, given our strong credit metrics, our credit quality is trending better than our expectations. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: First off, I just want to say, your slide deck is phenomenal. I just -- you answered so many of the questions that I had coming into this, I felt like you were reading my mind ahead of this call.\nWilliam Demchak: We have been, yes. The team did a nice job putting that together. Thank you for recognizing that.\nBetsy Graseck: No, it was great. You guys -- this is a great job. I have 2 questions. One is on the beta, the deposit beta, when you're talking about the 42%, obviously, that is aligned with the outlook that you just expressed for interest rate movements. I guess I wanted to just understand how you're thinking about the flex between deposit beta and deposit growth because part of me says, \"Hey, I could have expected even more deposit growth than you gave me QQ and is there a rate paid element to that, that maybe you're holding back on and that's why the deposits weren't maybe as high as what some folks like me had hoped.\nWilliam Demchak: We're sitting here puzzled. We grew deposits average and spot against a backdrop of absent the volatility in the market, deposit still overall leaving the system, particularly in the government money funds and then the shrinkage of the total on the QT. our rate paid, if you look year-on-year, I think our total deposits are down 3% or something, which is less than most anybody would compare to. And we have purposefully been protecting the franchise in the course of doing that, I recognize some other people don't do that, and that's we'll see how that plays out through time, but we kind of feel we outperformed on deposits, so a little bit, yes.\nBetsy Graseck: Yes. No, QQ definitely, and I would expect after all of the banks finish reporting, we can have a better conversation on this. I was just wondering if you felt that if you had a slightly higher rate paid, would you have pulled in more? And I suppose the way you answered that question is you don't feel the need to. So that's great. And then just separately, as a fallout of what has happened with [C&IB] signature, et cetera, do you feel like there's any need at all to reassess the duration of the commercial operating account deposit liability, life. Is that something that having seen what happened at [C&IB, ]you would want to take a closer look at? Or do you feel like it's just such a different animal given what you outlined on Slide 10 with the granularity you've got.\nWilliam Demchak: Well, first of all, we look at that all the time. And as Rob put into his comments, a large portion of the deposit growth that we saw through COVID. So stimulus in the growth in the Fed's balance sheet. We just assumed had a life of a day, 0, because we're in an abnormal period of time. The core operating deposits that we have, particularly as you go in the middle market, are basically the monies -- the working capital monies that companies use to run their companies. We truncate and always have truncated the modeled lives of those deposits well below what the practical experience would show us, yes. So it's conservative.\nRobert Reilly : And deposits that are spread out over diverse industries and diverse geographies.\nWilliam Demchak: And accounts, you almost can't compare what happened at Silicon Valley and Signature to any other bank I've ever seen in terms of the concentration of the deposit accounts.\nRobert Reilly : And the nature of the clients.\nWilliam Demchak: Just the nature of them. I mean a lot of that money was -- it's capital raise money that was sitting there.\nOperator: Our next question from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo : I guess this question goes in the category of no good deed goes unpunished. You're operating leverage in the first quarter year-over-year was over 10%. You've guided for positive operating leverage this year of 1% to 3%. Your cycle-to-date beta, I estimate being below 40%. So all that looks really good, but on the other hand, you did, I guess, lower your guidance for how much positive operating leverage this year. You mentioned NII, you mentioned the intensity on deposit pricing. So just can you help talk talk about the trade off pursuing growth with more deposits versus maybe scaling back if that deposit pricing is more intense? Or do you see that not being so at some point?\nWilliam Demchak: I think, Mike, part of the issue that we face here is you have an interest rate forward curve that's suggesting cuts out there. So if you believe that betas would be less. We kind of think the Fed's going to hold through the year and cut next year. Personally, I think they might hold longer than that. So everybody's NII guide is going to be all over the place depending on what they actually think the Fed is doing as we go into this -- the back of this year. Separately, we have seen just this heightened awareness of interest rates and what you do with deposits on the back of the banks have failed. You've seen the growth in the government money funds on the back of the Fed's reverse repo facility, which is a real thing. As long as they allow that to keep growing, they're at the market deposits, but they're basically getting drained from the banking system and making liquidity more expensive. So that's -- we took all that into account and said, \"Look, if rates are higher for longer, if the Fed keeps draining deposits through its reverse repo facility, smaller banks really need to pay up super high rates to fund their balance sheets. It's going to be painful for us, and that's what we put in our guide. That may or may not happen.\nRobert Reilly : And I would just add, we've got a focus on our core franchise and our clients. So on the commercial side, it's really the effect of commercial clients choosing to switch to interest-bearing from noninterest bearing. And the relationship is fully intact. And then on the consumer side, as Bill just mentioned, the interest-bearing deposits and the pressure around rates paid there.\nMike Mayo : And the one other point you guys have made is that either NII will be better or you might have to -- you might get to release some of your credit reserves. Have you seen any improvement in that loan pricing commensurate with some of the standards and the capital markets, your pricing for risk a lot more in the lending markets, you have not been pricing for risk and you brought that up before. Are you seeing that at all or still not yet?\nWilliam Demchak: Our new production is a little bit better than it was, but in fairness, at the moment, credit looks much better than we otherwise would have assumed. So it's a trade-off. Now it's going to be interesting, Mike, because the marginal cost of funds for the U.S. banking system has just gone up a lot as a result of this flurry. And so all else equal, you would expect credit spreads to widen here simply because the cost of funds for all banks has gone up. I haven't seen that play out yet, but it continues to be at least my expectation that it will.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Can you give us -- you guys pointed out about Rob, the expectations on TLAC in your prepared remarks, but can you guys give us some color on what changes may come as a result of the Signature and Silicon Valley bank failures, the regulators look like they're going to reassess the situation we'll get the post mortem on May 1, of course. But what do you guys think may happen in terms of additional requirements for regional banks like yours? And I know to you, like you're already planning on that, but outside of TLAC.\nWilliam Demchak: I don't know what it is they might do. There's a lot of talk around should they eliminate the available for sale, opt in or opt out for the AOCI for banks our size and they may well do that. Part of me though, the reason we put economic value of equity in our presentation is, as soon as you start isolating specific fixed rate assets and ignore others. So what do you do with fixed rate whole loan mortgages, what do you do with held, it's all the same stuff. It's an accounting entry. And so I would hope that they would have a more holistic look as they do in Europe on measuring balance sheet risk to interest rates. I don't know where that's going to end up. And whatever it is they do is going to take a period of time. TLAC, I think, is a certainty at this point. It's a function of how much it will be and whether it's varied as a function of size and complexity a bank.\nRobert Reilly : There's some tailor.\nGerard Cassidy: Go ahead, Rob.\nRobert Reilly : Those are the 2 prominent subjects, TLAC and AOCI inclusion.\nWilliam Demchak: By the way, the issue, it's just -- it's worth mentioning basic interest rate risk management and the test around liquidity that banks go through, I mean, we did this, we run this stuff every single day with all sorts of different scenarios and the regulators require us to and we get measured on it [indiscernible]. I don't even know who was looking at these other banks. It's -- so to come in and say we ought to do more. We're already doing it is, I guess, my point.\nGerard Cassidy: Very clear. And I'm glad you guys put the whole balance sheet, the equity valuation because that message has to get out, and I'm glad you guys did that. Moving on to commercial and industrial loans, you guys have seen really good growth over the past year. Can you give us a little more color on do you see a reintermediation coming into the banking system because the capital markets are still disrupted? Or is it just you guys have had success with BBVA and that's working for you. Can you give us some color on that growth that you're seeing?\nWilliam Demchak: A couple of comments. If you look back through our history, when we enter new markets, this is particularly through factor [PwC] and what we've seen with BBVA. We tend to grow loans at a pace in the new markets that would be above what you would expect as a long-term trend. And then over time, we cross-sell into those new relationships. So almost think of it as it's kind of advertising dollars she otherwise participate in a deal and I hope that you're going to get TM revenue and other things. What we'll see going forward is the cross-sell under the new relationships we've established. The ability to continue to grow loans at that pace should we choose to is probably still there? Do you get paid for it today the way you did when rates were much lower that's a tougher question. Now, the whole reintermediation in the banks from capital markets. I've heard some of that, by the way, the other way. All else equal, I suspect the long-term trend will be less in the banking system and more out of the banking system over a long, long period of time, notwithstanding what happens in the near future.\nOperator: Next question from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.\nJohn Pancari : And I agree on the slide deck, Very, very helpful detail. On the deposit front, just a couple of additional bit of detail, the beta expectation of terminal be 42% looks a little bit more conservative than the group and probably appropriately so. So it's good to see it. Can you maybe give us how that breaks down by way of commercial deposit beta expectation at this point versus consumer.\nRobert Reilly : Yes, sure. Yes, sure. John, it's Rob. The way that we look at it in terms of determining where we're going to end up, and again, it's an expectation. We'll see how it plays out ultimately, but you're on the right track. So if you take a look at our total deposits of $437 billion and you take commercial and the high net worth, the consumer portion of it is high net worth, which is around $230 billion. Those betas have moved. They're already a terminal. It's done. So that leaves roughly $200 billion or so in consumer deposits, as I mentioned in my comments, 10% of those are noninterest-bearing, which are transactional accounts, we don't expect a change. So you're at $170 billion, the minority of our total deposits of interest-bearing consumer deposits that are sort of in play and that we expect to pay higher rates on. So that's how we get to maybe a more conservative number than what you're seeing on peers that don't have the same mix.\nJohn Pancari : Okay. That's helpful. Also on the deposit front, if I could also a little more detail on the amount of inflows that you may have seen during the March time period around the failures. Can you maybe quantify the amount and if you expect any outflow of any of those inputs that you saw?\nRobert Reilly : So we did see in mid-March. We saw some inflows during that week that at the height of the disruption, but a lot of that's settled out. So we don't expect to see that be a factor for us positively or negatively as we move into the second quarter.\nWilliam Demchak: The only thing I'd say, we actually opened in March, twice the number of accounts in our C&IB franchise that we would otherwise open in a month. So away from the deposits that came in, we actually got a bunch of clients. The deposits will stay and get mixed, some will go, but we grew our account portfolio pretty substantially in one month.\nJohn Pancari : Okay. Great. If I could put one more in there. Just on the office front, do you happen to have perhaps the refreshed LTVs that you're starting to see in that portfolio?\nWilliam Demchak: It's a good question, and I haven't seen them, but it's worth. I don't know we put in the deck or not, but we underwrite to what 55 to 60.\nRobert Reilly : 55 to 60.\nWilliam Demchak: And all of that stuff is stale and all the appraisals that you get are stale. And so in effect, what we end up doing is you assume that less leases renew than you otherwise would in a normal cash flow analysis. You dropped that pretty materially. You assume that lease rates, all else equal, are going to go down and then you have to put in the rehab costs to re-lease it. And then you discounted at a lower rate. So we've done all that building by building and then taking reserves against final kind of point make you think about Rob's number, it was at 9.6% we have against.\nRobert Reilly : Multi-tenant, right.\nWilliam Demchak: Effectively, you're saying, all right, I can have 20% of Class A office default and lose $0.50 on the dollar on a portfolio that was originally underwritten at 60%. That's a pretty severe outcome.\nRobert Reilly : Yes. And I would just add to that, John. So Bill mentioned it, we have a relatively small portfolio. So we're able to go asset by asset rather than just broad strokes across a general portfolio.\nWilliam Demchak: We -- look, we know how to do this, but we've been in the business for a long time. We have all the resources and have seen the activity in [Meadowlands]. We know all the borrowers were with. And we think we've laid it out pretty clearly. We're going to have charge-offs, but we've...\nRobert Reilly : That's why we built reserves.\nWilliam Demchak: Where they're coming from and we've built the reserves.\nOperator: Next question from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.\nBill Carcache : Bill and Rob, I wanted to follow up on the deposit beta commentary. Rob, you mentioned that mid-20% noninterest-bearing deposit mix that's implicit I believe, in your 42% terminal beta assumption. It looks like that would get you back to pre-COVID levels on Slide 11, I think. How are you thinking about the risk that that noninterest-bearing mix will continue to fall, not just the pre-COVID levels but potentially even lower. Perhaps some have talked about.\nRobert Reilly : Yes, we can see and we take a look at the nature of the accounts, mid-20s is our estimate. It could go lower. Our expectations are, though, that it would be in the mid-20s. And that's really on the basis of the nature of the operating accounts that we have, but as we just were mentioning, we know really well, and we know the nature of their activities. So it's really a knowledge of our operating book that gives us that indication.\nBill Carcache : Understood. And then separately, following up on your commentary around potential regulatory uncertainty. In light of bars, your recent Senate testimony, I was hoping you could address broadly how you're all thinking about the levers at your disposal to the extent that the regulatory environment grows more challenging, certainly, your -- it seems like you're well positioned, but in terms of levers, whether it's RWA growth, buyback, dividend, if you could just frame how you think about those to the extent that it does get more challenging?\nWilliam Demchak: Not sure. If you put AOCI in, we're already kind of over the threshold. All else equal, I think we're well positioned and fine. We -- as Rob mentioned, we're at least at the moment, being conservative on our thoughts on share repurchase, but most of that is to kind of laid out the current environment, get through earnings and see where we are. I don't see any issue coming out of regulation that we won't be able to handle in the due course.\nRobert Reilly : And that would largely be in the obvious areas of capital and liquidity where we're strong.\nOperator: Next question from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.\nScott Siefers : So you reduced the full year '23 loan growth expectation a bit. I was wondering if you could comment for a second on how much of that is sort of lower either existing or anticipated demand? And how much is you guys just sort of being more conservative about where you hope to kind of direct your capital liquidity.\nWilliam Demchak: It's a great question. It's probably 50-50. So demand has softened a little bit. And then the marginal cost of [indiscernible] new clients has gone up so a little more picky than we were. It's probably 50-50.\nRobert Reilly : And that spread issue that we talked about that we think that we should be paid more for the risk.\nScott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. And then, Bill, I was hoping you could expand just a bit on that commercial account opening comment you made a couple of questions ago. Maybe as you sort of think of how the sort of the world might look going forward for commercial customers. Do you think they'll just maybe diversify their relationships to protect themselves a little? How will an operational account work? Will people just keep less in their operational accounts and sprinkle it elsewhere? Any thoughts on how things might evolve.\nWilliam Demchak: I'm not sure. We haven't seen anything with our legacy clients in terms of behavior. Now they've -- we've seen money go into sweep accounts, government funds from corporates and individuals largely is a function of rate. I don't know that it has anything to do with diversification. As you go for smaller banks, I suppose that could become an issue depending on how much visibility there is into that particular bank's balance sheet, but we just haven't seen any of that.\nOperator: Next question from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: I just want to dig on the guidance a little bit. the second quarter guidance is clear for the revenue step down. And kind of that implies in the full year guide that second half revenue is pretty equal to first half revenue. I'm just wondering if you can kind of maybe give us some NII versus fees? And are you expecting any just better stability or increase as you go through the year perhaps in fees versus what might happen in NII?\nRobert Reilly : Okay. I think you're asking in terms of the full year. So we've given you the new guidance around our NII, and then we've been through that. As far as fees go, we're calling it to be stable year-over-year and there's some moving parts in there. Some of the fee categories are doing a little better than we expected. Some are doing a little bit worse, but altogether, it's still stable.\nKen Usdin: Okay. And within that, can I question, your Harris Williams business has just been a great one over the years. In this environment, obviously, M&A is slower, but is there also -- is there any sense or chance that also like midsized companies have to do a rethink here? I'm just kind of wondering just where you think the pipelines and outlook are for that business specifically?\nRobert Reilly : Yes. So Harris Williams, you're accurate in terms of -- that's our biggest driver of our capital markets advisory businesses, and they had a slower than usual quarter in the first quarter obviously reflecting a lot of the disruption. And the pipelines are still pretty good. We're not expecting a big rebound in the second quarter, but potentially in the second half, but to your point, a lot of that depends on the psychology at the time. And the ability and the support for both buyers and sellers to do deals.\nKen Usdin: Rob, one on your footnote on your beta slide says that you don't include time deposits in your beta count. So we generally to assume that the beta on time deposits is obviously very high, just given what we know to the early point that Phil made about industry funding costs.\nRobert Reilly : Yes, that's right. And again, that's a conventional measure. So that's not our own personal PNC measure. That's how the industry calculates it.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Next question from the line [indiscernible] with Point72.\nUnidentified Analyst: A quick question, if I may, on the commercial real estate, a follow-up 1 on criticized loans on Slide 18. 20% as much as your -- the rest of your commercial real estate book. So I would just like to understand what was this number before and how you would expect this number to evolve for EMEA?\nRobert Reilly : I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't follow all of that.\nUnidentified Analyst: On Slide 18, you mentioned that our office size loan ratio is 20%. I just would like to know what was this number before for previous quarters? And how do you expect this number to evolve --\nRobert Reilly : So the 2.7% -- it's been pretty steady. So it's been a small percentage of our total commercial real estate hasn't changed nor do we expect it, certainly not to go up.\nOperator: Next question from the line of Alan Davis, Matt t markets.\nUnidentified Analyst: Alan Davis here from NatWest Markets. Just a very quick question and echo what everybody said that the disclosure and information here is fantastic. With all the market noise that went on after SEB, and I totally get the difference, and I totally agree with what you're saying about the accounting standards and so on. Nevertheless, there's a lot of keen interest in the unrealized losses on the hold-to-maturity portfolio. Are you able to provide any color or guidance there? I don't think all of that would be in AOCI. Is there anything that you can help guide me with in that regard.\nWilliam Demchak: To add-on held to maturity, so inside of AOCI today is one number, and then we have another smaller loss in held to maturity, which we disclosed.\nRobert Reilly : $3.5 billion.\nUnidentified Analyst: I apologize. I did not see that, fantastic. Sorry, didn\u2019t mean to waste your time.\nOperator: We have no further questions on the front line.\nWilliam Demchak : Okay. Well, thank you for joining our call and your interest in PNC. And if you have any other additional questions or need follow-up, please feel free to reach out to the IR team. Thank you.\nRobert Reilly : Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and ask you to please disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "William Demchak",
            "content": "Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you can see on the slide, our quarterly results were strong, and we reported $1.7 billion in net income or $3.98 per share. Inside of this, we grew deposits and loans, increased our capital and liquidity positions generated positive operating leverage and maintain strong credit quality. For the past month, we've seen market volatility across the broader industry. And while we take this situation seriously and are closely monitoring the environment, it's important to note that these events have taken place within a few banks with very unique business models. Inside of our company, we really haven't seen any meaningful impacts from the events of the past month. Our balance sheet remains strong and stable, and we are operating the company in the same way we were at the beginning of March. Ultimately, over time, we expect the dynamics playing out in the banking system today to contribute to changes in the competitive landscape. And while it's still early innings, we believe that PNC will be a beneficiary from this process. That said, in the near term, we're not immune to the competitive environment and the deposit dynamics that will ultimately impact our NII in the near term, and Rob is going to cover that in more detail in a second. We remain focused on growing relationships across our lines of business, and we continue to execute on key priorities, including the expansion in the BBVA legacy markets. Rob will provide more details on our financial performance in a moment. However, for this particular call, he'll review our first quarter earnings in a slightly condensed manner to allow time to also cover key balance sheet focus points that have been top of mind for our investors in the last couple of weeks. And of course, following that, we'll be able to discuss your specific questions in the Q&A segment. Finally, I'd like to thank our 61,000 employees for helping deliver a strong quarter and everything they do to support our customers. Now with that, I'll turn it over to Rob. We have been, yes. The team did a nice job putting that together. Thank you for recognizing that. We're sitting here puzzled. We grew deposits average and spot against a backdrop of absent the volatility in the market, deposit still overall leaving the system, particularly in the government money funds and then the shrinkage of the total on the QT. our rate paid, if you look year-on-year, I think our total deposits are down 3% or something, which is less than most anybody would compare to. And we have purposefully been protecting the franchise in the course of doing that, I recognize some other people don't do that, and that's we'll see how that plays out through time, but we kind of feel we outperformed on deposits, so a little bit, yes. Well, first of all, we look at that all the time. And as Rob put into his comments, a large portion of the deposit growth that we saw through COVID. So stimulus in the growth in the Fed's balance sheet. We just assumed had a life of a day, 0, because we're in an abnormal period of time. The core operating deposits that we have, particularly as you go in the middle market, are basically the monies -- the working capital monies that companies use to run their companies. We truncate and always have truncated the modeled lives of those deposits well below what the practical experience would show us, yes. So it's conservative. And accounts, you almost can't compare what happened at Silicon Valley and Signature to any other bank I've ever seen in terms of the concentration of the deposit accounts. Just the nature of them. I mean a lot of that money was -- it's capital raise money that was sitting there. I think, Mike, part of the issue that we face here is you have an interest rate forward curve that's suggesting cuts out there. So if you believe that betas would be less. We kind of think the Fed's going to hold through the year and cut next year. Personally, I think they might hold longer than that. So everybody's NII guide is going to be all over the place depending on what they actually think the Fed is doing as we go into this -- the back of this year. Separately, we have seen just this heightened awareness of interest rates and what you do with deposits on the back of the banks have failed. You've seen the growth in the government money funds on the back of the Fed's reverse repo facility, which is a real thing. As long as they allow that to keep growing, they're at the market deposits, but they're basically getting drained from the banking system and making liquidity more expensive. So that's -- we took all that into account and said, \"Look, if rates are higher for longer, if the Fed keeps draining deposits through its reverse repo facility, smaller banks really need to pay up super high rates to fund their balance sheets. It's going to be painful for us, and that's what we put in our guide. That may or may not happen. Our new production is a little bit better than it was, but in fairness, at the moment, credit looks much better than we otherwise would have assumed. So it's a trade-off. Now it's going to be interesting, Mike, because the marginal cost of funds for the U.S. banking system has just gone up a lot as a result of this flurry. And so all else equal, you would expect credit spreads to widen here simply because the cost of funds for all banks has gone up. I haven't seen that play out yet, but it continues to be at least my expectation that it will. I don't know what it is they might do. There's a lot of talk around should they eliminate the available for sale, opt in or opt out for the AOCI for banks our size and they may well do that. Part of me though, the reason we put economic value of equity in our presentation is, as soon as you start isolating specific fixed rate assets and ignore others. So what do you do with fixed rate whole loan mortgages, what do you do with held, it's all the same stuff. It's an accounting entry. And so I would hope that they would have a more holistic look as they do in Europe on measuring balance sheet risk to interest rates. I don't know where that's going to end up. And whatever it is they do is going to take a period of time. TLAC, I think, is a certainty at this point. It's a function of how much it will be and whether it's varied as a function of size and complexity a bank. By the way, the issue, it's just -- it's worth mentioning basic interest rate risk management and the test around liquidity that banks go through, I mean, we did this, we run this stuff every single day with all sorts of different scenarios and the regulators require us to and we get measured on it [indiscernible]. I don't even know who was looking at these other banks. It's -- so to come in and say we ought to do more. We're already doing it is, I guess, my point. A couple of comments. If you look back through our history, when we enter new markets, this is particularly through factor [PwC] and what we've seen with BBVA. We tend to grow loans at a pace in the new markets that would be above what you would expect as a long-term trend. And then over time, we cross-sell into those new relationships. So almost think of it as it's kind of advertising dollars she otherwise participate in a deal and I hope that you're going to get TM revenue and other things. What we'll see going forward is the cross-sell under the new relationships we've established. The ability to continue to grow loans at that pace should we choose to is probably still there? Do you get paid for it today the way you did when rates were much lower that's a tougher question. Now, the whole reintermediation in the banks from capital markets. I've heard some of that, by the way, the other way. All else equal, I suspect the long-term trend will be less in the banking system and more out of the banking system over a long, long period of time, notwithstanding what happens in the near future. The only thing I'd say, we actually opened in March, twice the number of accounts in our C&IB franchise that we would otherwise open in a month. So away from the deposits that came in, we actually got a bunch of clients. The deposits will stay and get mixed, some will go, but we grew our account portfolio pretty substantially in one month. It's a good question, and I haven't seen them, but it's worth. I don't know we put in the deck or not, but we underwrite to what 55 to 60. And all of that stuff is stale and all the appraisals that you get are stale. And so in effect, what we end up doing is you assume that less leases renew than you otherwise would in a normal cash flow analysis. You dropped that pretty materially. You assume that lease rates, all else equal, are going to go down and then you have to put in the rehab costs to re-lease it. And then you discounted at a lower rate. So we've done all that building by building and then taking reserves against final kind of point make you think about Rob's number, it was at 9.6% we have against. Effectively, you're saying, all right, I can have 20% of Class A office default and lose $0.50 on the dollar on a portfolio that was originally underwritten at 60%. That's a pretty severe outcome. We -- look, we know how to do this, but we've been in the business for a long time. We have all the resources and have seen the activity in [Meadowlands]. We know all the borrowers were with. And we think we've laid it out pretty clearly. We're going to have charge-offs, but we've... Where they're coming from and we've built the reserves. Not sure. If you put AOCI in, we're already kind of over the threshold. All else equal, I think we're well positioned and fine. We -- as Rob mentioned, we're at least at the moment, being conservative on our thoughts on share repurchase, but most of that is to kind of laid out the current environment, get through earnings and see where we are. I don't see any issue coming out of regulation that we won't be able to handle in the due course. It's a great question. It's probably 50-50. So demand has softened a little bit. And then the marginal cost of [indiscernible] new clients has gone up so a little more picky than we were. It's probably 50-50. I'm not sure. We haven't seen anything with our legacy clients in terms of behavior. Now they've -- we've seen money go into sweep accounts, government funds from corporates and individuals largely is a function of rate. I don't know that it has anything to do with diversification. As you go for smaller banks, I suppose that could become an issue depending on how much visibility there is into that particular bank's balance sheet, but we just haven't seen any of that. To add-on held to maturity, so inside of AOCI today is one number, and then we have another smaller loss in held to maturity, which we disclosed. Okay. Well, thank you for joining our call and your interest in PNC. And if you have any other additional questions or need follow-up, please feel free to reach out to the IR team. Thank you."

            "name": "Robert Reilly",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. Loans for the first quarter were $326 billion, an increase of $3.6 billion or 1% linked quarter. Investment securities were relatively stable at $143 billion. Cash balances at the Federal Reserve averaged $34 billion and increased $4 billion during the quarter. Deposits of $436 billion grew on both a spot and average basis linked quarter. Average borrowed funds increased $4 billion, which reflected fourth quarter 2022 activity as well as senior note issuances in January of this year. At quarter end, our tangible book value was $76.90 per common share, an increase of 7% linked quarter and we remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.2% as of March 31, 2023. During the quarter, we returned $1 billion of capital to shareholders which included $600 million of common dividends and approximately $370 million of share repurchases or 2.4 million shares. Due to market conditions and increased economic uncertainty, we expect to reduce our share repurchase activity in the second quarter. And of course, we'll continue to monitor this and may adjust share repurchase activity as appropriate. Slide 5 shows our loans and deposits in more detail. During the first quarter, loan balances averaged $326 billion, an increase of $4 billion or 1%, largely reflecting the full quarter impact of growth in the fourth quarter of 2022. Deposits averaged $436 billion in the first quarter, increasing $1.3 billion. We continue to see a mix shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing, and I will cover that in more detail in a few minutes. Our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits has increased to 1.6% during the first quarter from 1.07% in the fourth quarter of 2022. And as of March 31, our cumulative deposit beta was 35%. Turning to the income statement on Slide 6. As you can see, first quarter 2023 reported net income was $1.7 billion, or $3.98 per share. Total revenues of $5.6 billion decreased to $160 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Net interest income decreased $99 million or 3% primarily driven by 2 fewer days in the quarter and higher funding costs, partially offset by higher yields on interest-earning assets. Our net interest margin of 2.84%, declined 8 basis points reflecting the increased funding costs, I just mentioned. Noninterest income also declined 3% or $61 million as growth in asset management and brokerage was more than offset by a general slowdown in capital markets activity as well as seasonally lower consumer transaction volumes. First quarter expenses declined $153 million or 4% linked quarter, even after accounting for the increase to the FDIC's deposit assessment rate which equated to $25 million. Provision was $235 million in the first quarter and included the impact of updated economic assumptions as well as changes in portfolio composition and quality. And our effective tax rate was 17.2%. Turning to Slide 7. We highlight our revenue and expense trends. As a result of our diversified revenue streams and expense management efforts, we generated positive operating leverage of 2% linked quarter and 15% compared to the same period a year ago. And as we previously stated, we have a goal to reduce costs by $400 million in 2023 through our continuous improvement program, and we're confident we will achieve our full year target. And as you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 8. Nonperforming loans remained stable at $2 billion and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies of $1.3 billion declined $164 million or 11% linked quarter. Notably, the delinquency rate of 41 basis points is our lowest level in over a decade. Net charge-offs were $195 million, a decrease of $29 million linked quarter. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans ratio was 24 basis points in the first quarter and our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.4 billion or 1.7% of total loans on March 31, essentially stable with year-end 2022. Before I provide an update on our forward guidance, as Bill mentioned, we want to take a deeper dive into some of the key balance sheet items that are top of mind in the current environment related to deposits, securities and swaps, capital and liquidity and the impact of potential regulatory changes. And finally, office exposure within our commercial portfolio. In our view, we believe we're well positioned across all these key areas of focus. Turning to Slide 10. Our $437 billion deposit base is broken down between consumer and commercial categories to give you a view of the composition and granularity of the portfolio. At the end of the first quarter, our deposits were 53% consumer and 47% commercial. Inside of our $230 billion of consumer deposits, approximately 90% are FDIC insured. The portfolio is very granular with an average account balance of approximately $11,500 across nearly 20 million accounts throughout our coast-to-coast franchise. Our $207 billion of commercial deposits are 20% insured, but importantly, approximately 95% of the total balances are held in operating and relationship accounts. These include deposits held as compensating balances to pay for treasury management fees, escrow deposits at Meadowlands loan services and broader relationship accounts, all of which tend to provide more stability than deposit-only accounts. Importantly, we have approximately 1.4 million commercial deposit accounts, representing a diverse set of industries and geographies. Turning to Slide 11. We highlight our mix of noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits. Our consumer deposits, noninterest-bearing mix has been stable, remaining at 10% compared to the same period a year ago. The commercial side is where we expected to see a continued shift from noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing deposits as rates have risen and that has played out, albeit at a somewhat faster pace than we had expected. The commercial noninterest-bearing portion of total deposits was 45% as of March 31, down from 58% a year ago. Importantly, commercial noninterest-bearing include the compensating balances and Meadowlands deposits, I mentioned previously, which provides support to this mix through time. On a consolidated basis, our level of noninterest-bearing deposits was 27% at the end of the first quarter of 2023, down from 33% a year ago. PNC has historically operated with a higher percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits relative to the banking industry due in part to the strength of our treasury management business and granular deposit base. As a result, we expect our noninterest-bearing portion of deposits to continue to exceed industry averages, and approach the mid-20% range by year-end 2023. In addition to our mix shift, we have seen a faster increase in our deposit cost this year as the Federal Reserve has continued to raise short-term interest rates. Slide 12 shows our recent trends and our current expectations for deposit betas through the end of 2023. The increase in our current deposit beta expectations are largely driven by recent events that have increased the intensity and focus on rates paid and ultimately, has added incremental pricing pressure sooner than we previously expected. We expect the Federal Reserve to raise the benchmark rate by 25 basis points in May. This, coupled with heightened competition for deposits, has accelerated our expectations to the level and pace of beta increase and we now expect to reach a terminal beta of 42% by year-end. Slide 13 details our investment securities and swap portfolios. Our securities balance averaged $143 billion in the first quarter and were relatively stable linked quarter. The yield on our securities portfolio increased 13 basis points to 2.49%, as we continue to replace runoff at higher reinvestment rates. Yields on new purchases during the quarter exceeded 4.75%. Our portfolio is high quality and positioned with a short duration of 4.3 years, meaningfully shorter than many of our peers. Approximately 2/3 of our securities are recorded as held to maturity and 1/3 is available for sale. Average security balances represent approximately 28% of interest-earning assets. Our received fixed swaps pointed to the commercial loan book remained largely stable at $42 billion in notional value and 2.25-year duration. At the end of the first quarter, our accumulated other comprehensive loss improved by $1.1 billion or 10% to $9.1 billion, driven by the impact of lower interest rates during the quarter and normal accretion as the securities and swaps pulled apart. Slide 14 highlights the pace of expected security and swap maturities as well as the related AOCI runoff. By the end of 2024, we expect about 26% of our securities and swaps to roll off. This will drive increases in our securities and commercial loan yields as well as meaningful tangible book value improvement as we expect approximately 40% AOCI accretion by the end of year 2024. Slide 15 highlights our strong liquidity position. Our strong liquidity coverage ratios continued to improve in the first quarter and exceeded regulatory requirements throughout the quarter. Our cash balance is at the Federal Reserve totaled $34 billion, and we maintained substantial unused borrowing capacity and flexibility through other funding sources. includes a required statutory daily liquidity coverage ratio assessment as well as a monthly net stable funding ratio calculation. In addition, we performed monthly internal liquidity stress testing that covers a range of time horizons as well as systemic and idiosyncratic stress scenarios. Our mix of borrowed funds to total liabilities has historically averaged approximately 17% and reached an unprecedented low level of 6% in 2021. On March 31, our mix was 12% and we expect to move closer to the historical average over time. In light of the current environment, we anticipate that we will be subject to a total loss absorbing capacity requirement in some form and at some point, with a reasonable phase-in period. Importantly, as our borrowed funds continue to return to a more normalized level, we would expect to be compliant through our current issuance plans under existing TLAC requirements. Slide 16 shows our solid capital position with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.2% at quarter end. As a Category 3 institution, we don't include AOCI in our CET1 ratio, but I understand why there is focus on this ratio with the inclusion of AOCI. As of March 31, 2023, our CET1 ratio, including AOCI, was estimated to be 7.5%, which remains above our 7.4% required level, taking into account our current stress capital buffer. However, we also believe it's important to take a look at the balance sheet positioning of the bank from a market value of equity perspective. similar to our understanding of Basel IRRBB rules. Market value of equity doesn't truly get reflected on the balance sheet today due to generally accepted accounting principles, which results in a skewed approach about valuing certain items primary on the asset side. While AOCI take into account the current valuation of the securities and certain portions of our swap portfolios, it does not account for the valuation of the deposit book which can be a meaningful offset in a rising interest rate environment. In fact, looking at PNC's change in market value of equity over the past year, the increase in the market value of our deposits and the rapidly rising interest rate environment has significantly outpaced all unrealized losses on the asset side of the balance sheet, including securities and fixed rate loans. Total market value of equity increased substantially in the rising rate environment, and further, our duration of equity is now essentially 0 and well positioned in the current environment. Importantly, our models use conservative assumptions regarding estimates for betas, mix, balances, we also recognized early on that large inflows of deposits during the pandemic were driven by a combination of QE and fiscal stimulus, which were likely to be short-lived. Recall our Fed balances peaked in the first quarter of 2021 around $86 billion. As a result, we modeled an economic value associated with those deposits at a fraction of the value of core deposits. Turning to Slide 17. I I wanted to spend a few minutes talking about our commercial real estate portfolio. While credit quality is strong across the majority of our CRE book, office is a segment receiving a lot of attention in this environment due to the shift to remote work and higher interest rates. So we thought it would be worthwhile to highlight our exposure and our position with this portfolio. At the end of the first quarter, we had $8.9 billion or 2.7% of our total loans in our office portfolio. Turning to Slide 18. You can see the composition of this portfolio, which is well diversified across geography, tenant type and property classification. Reserves against these loans, which we have built over several quarters, now totaled 7.1%, a level that we believe adequately covers expected losses. In regard to our underwriting approach, we adhere to conservative standards, focused on attractive markets and work with experienced well [indiscernible]. The office portfolio was originated with an approximate loan to value of 55% to 60% and a significant majority of those properties are defined as Class A. We have a highly experienced team that is reviewing each asset in the portfolio to set appropriate action plans and test reserve adequacy. We don't solely rely on third-party appraisals, which will naturally be slow to adjust to the rapidly shifting market conditions. Rather, we are stress testing property performance to set realistic expectations. To appropriately [sensitize] our portfolio, we significantly discounted net operating income levels and property values across the entire office book. Additionally, tenant retention, build-out costs and concession levels are all updated to accurately reflect market conditions. Credit quality in our office portfolio remains strong today with only 0.2% of loans delinquent, 3.5% nonperforming and a net charge-off rate of 47 basis points over the last 12 months. Along those lines, we continue to see solid performance within the single tenant, medical and government loans, which represent 40% of our total office portfolio. These have occupancy levels above 90% and watch list levels of 3% or less. Where we do see increasing stress and a rising level of criticized assets, is in our multi-tenant loans, which represents 58% of our office portfolio. Multi-tenant loans are currently running in the mid-70% occupancy range. watchless levels are greater than 30% and and 60% of the portfolio is scheduled to mature by the end of 2024. In the near, this is our primary concern area as it relates to expected losses and by extension, comprises the largest portion of our office reserves. Multi-tenant reserves on a stand-alone basis are 9.4%. Obviously, we'll continue to monitor and review our assumptions to ensure they reflect real-time market conditions. For each of the key areas of focus, I just discussed, we believe we are well positioned. And Slide 9 summarizes our balance sheet strength during this volatile time. Our deposits are up, our capital and liquidity positions are strong, and our overall credit quality is solid. In summary, PNC reported a strong first quarter '23. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we are expecting a recession starting in the second half of 2023, resulting in a 1% decline in real GDP. Our rate path assumption includes a 25 basis point increase in the Fed funds rate in May. Following that, we expect the Fed to pause rate actions until early 2024, when we expect a 25 basis point cut. Looking ahead, our outlook for full year 2023 compared to 2022 results is as follows: We expect spot loan growth of 1% to 3%, which equates to average loan growth of 5% to 7%. Total revenue growth to be up 4% to 5%. Inside of that, our expectation is for net interest income to be up 6% to 8%. At this point, visibility remains challenging, and our full year NII guidance assumes the continuation of the recent intensity on deposit pricing, which is being driven by recent events. We expect noninterest income to be stable, expenses to be up 2% to 3%, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. Based on this guidance, we expect we will generate positive operating leverage in 2023. Looking at the second quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2023, we expect average loans to be stable, net interest income to be down 2% to 4%, fee income to be stable to down 1%. Other noninterest income to be between $200 million and $250 million excluding net securities and Visa activity. Taking all the component pieces, we expect total revenue to decline approximately 3%. We expect total noninterest expense to be up 1% to 2%, and we expect second quarter net charge-offs to be between $200 million and $250 million. Further, given our strong credit metrics, our credit quality is trending better than our expectations. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions. And deposits that are spread out over diverse industries and diverse geographies. And the nature of the clients. And I would just add, we've got a focus on our core franchise and our clients. So on the commercial side, it's really the effect of commercial clients choosing to switch to interest-bearing from noninterest bearing. And the relationship is fully intact. And then on the consumer side, as Bill just mentioned, the interest-bearing deposits and the pressure around rates paid there. There's some tailor. Those are the 2 prominent subjects, TLAC and AOCI inclusion. Yes, sure. Yes, sure. John, it's Rob. The way that we look at it in terms of determining where we're going to end up, and again, it's an expectation. We'll see how it plays out ultimately, but you're on the right track. So if you take a look at our total deposits of $437 billion and you take commercial and the high net worth, the consumer portion of it is high net worth, which is around $230 billion. Those betas have moved. They're already a terminal. It's done. So that leaves roughly $200 billion or so in consumer deposits, as I mentioned in my comments, 10% of those are noninterest-bearing, which are transactional accounts, we don't expect a change. So you're at $170 billion, the minority of our total deposits of interest-bearing consumer deposits that are sort of in play and that we expect to pay higher rates on. So that's how we get to maybe a more conservative number than what you're seeing on peers that don't have the same mix. So we did see in mid-March. We saw some inflows during that week that at the height of the disruption, but a lot of that's settled out. So we don't expect to see that be a factor for us positively or negatively as we move into the second quarter. 55 to 60. Multi-tenant, right. Yes. And I would just add to that, John. So Bill mentioned it, we have a relatively small portfolio. So we're able to go asset by asset rather than just broad strokes across a general portfolio. That's why we built reserves. Yes, we can see and we take a look at the nature of the accounts, mid-20s is our estimate. It could go lower. Our expectations are, though, that it would be in the mid-20s. And that's really on the basis of the nature of the operating accounts that we have, but as we just were mentioning, we know really well, and we know the nature of their activities. So it's really a knowledge of our operating book that gives us that indication. And that would largely be in the obvious areas of capital and liquidity where we're strong. And that spread issue that we talked about that we think that we should be paid more for the risk. Okay. I think you're asking in terms of the full year. So we've given you the new guidance around our NII, and then we've been through that. As far as fees go, we're calling it to be stable year-over-year and there's some moving parts in there. Some of the fee categories are doing a little better than we expected. Some are doing a little bit worse, but altogether, it's still stable. Yes. So Harris Williams, you're accurate in terms of -- that's our biggest driver of our capital markets advisory businesses, and they had a slower than usual quarter in the first quarter obviously reflecting a lot of the disruption. And the pipelines are still pretty good. We're not expecting a big rebound in the second quarter, but potentially in the second half, but to your point, a lot of that depends on the psychology at the time. And the ability and the support for both buyers and sellers to do deals. Yes, that's right. And again, that's a conventional measure. So that's not our own personal PNC measure. That's how the industry calculates it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't follow all of that. So the 2.7% -- it's been pretty steady. So it's been a small percentage of our total commercial real estate hasn't changed nor do we expect it, certainly not to go up. $3.5 billion. Thank you."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Bryan Gill, Executive Vice President and Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nBryan Gill: Well, good morning. Welcome to today's conference call for The PNC Financial Services Group. I am Bryan Gill, the Director of Invest Relations for PNC, and participating on this call are PNC's Chairman and CEO, Bill Demchak and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information, as well as reconciliations of non-GAPP measures, are included in today's earnings release materials, as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website pnc.com under Invest relations. These statements speak only as of October 15, 2024, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Demchak: Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we had a very good third quarter. We executed well and saw a strong momentum across our franchise. We generated $1.5 billion in net income worth $3.49, diluted earnings per share. Rob will take you through the details shortly, but I wanted to highlight a few points. First, we generated positive operating leverage for the third consecutive quarter. And as an aside, our strong performance has positioned us to deliver positive operating leverage for the full-year of 2024. Inside of the third quarter performance NII grew 3% as we continue our growth trajectory towards expected record NII in 2025. Our fee income grew 10% with a very strong quarter in capital markets and we remain disciplined on the expense front. Second, we continue to see strong growth and activity across our franchise. CNIB continues to have great momentum as new loan production and commitments increased this quarter. While overall loan utilization has remained soft, the recent Fed actions to lower interest rates and the expectation of further cuts is likely to spur greater demand as we move ahead. Importantly, we are well positioned to serve our customers when loan growth returns. Within retail, we continue to invest heavily in our branch network to build density in our most attractive growth markets, and we are seeing success. We continue to grow customer households and checking accounts with the highest customer growth being realized in the Southwest markets. AMG is accelerating growth in high-opportunity markets and benefiting from favorable equity markets. Third, our overall credit quality remains relatively stable, reflecting our thoughtful approach to managing risk, customer selection, and long-term relationship development. While we expect additional charge-offs in the CRE office segment, we're adequately reserved. Lastly, we continued to strengthen our capital levels during the quarter, and with the ongoing improvement in AOCI, our tangible book value per share increased 9%. In summary, we delivered strong results in the quarter, and we remain well positioned to continue our momentum. In fact, we're in the middle of our strategic planning process and I can't recall a time when our organic growth opportunities have ever been more attractive. Now before I turn it over to Rob for more detail on the financial results and outlook, I'd like to say thank you to our employees for everything that they do for our customers and our company. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob to take you through the quarter. Rob?\nRob Reilly: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on slide four and is presented on an average linked quarter basis. Loans of $320 billion were stable. Investment securities increased slightly by $1 billion or 1%. And our cash balances at the Federal Reserve were $45 billion, an increase of $4 billion or 10%. Deposit balances grew $5 billion or 1% and averaged $422 billion. Borrowed funds decreased $1 billion or 2%, primarily due to the maturity of FHLB advances, partially offset by parent company debt issuances. At quarter end, AOCI was negative $5.1 billion, an improvement of $2.4 billion, or 32%, compared with June 30. Our tangible book value increased to approximately $97 per common share, which was a 9% increase linked quarter and a 24% increase, compared to the same period a year ago. We remain well capitalized in our estimated CET1 ratio increased to 10.3% as of September 30. Regarding the Basel III endgame, while certain aspects of the proposed rules are likely to change, we estimate our revised standardized ratio, which includes AOCI to be 9.2% at quarter end. We continue to be well positioned with capital flexibility, and we returned roughly $800 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter through common dividends and share repurchases. Slide five shows our loans in more detail. Average loan balances of $320 billion were flat, compared to the second quarter, as well as the same period a year ago. And the yield on total loans increased 8 basis points to 6.13% in the third quarter. Commercial loans were stable at $219 billion linked quarter, as utilization rates remained low and well below the historical average of roughly 55%. We continue to have confidence that commercial loan demand will return in the coming quarters as our loan commitments continue to increase and we expect business investment to return to historical levels. Consumer loans average $101 billion and were stable with the second quarter as growth in auto loans was mostly offset by a decline in residential real estate balances. Slide six details our investment security and swap portfolios. Average investment securities of $142 billion increased $1 billion or 1%. The securities portfolio yield increased 24 basis points to 3.08%, driven by higher rates on new purchases and the full quarter impact of the securities repositioning. As of September 30, our securities portfolio duration was approximately 3.3 years. Our active received fixed rate swaps pointed to the commercial loan book totaled $33 billion on September 30, and the weighted average rate increased 58 basis points to 3.08%. Our forward starting swaps were $15 billion with a weighted average received rate of 4.26%. Importantly, with our forward starting swaps, we've locked in the replacement yield on the majority of our 2025 swap maturities at levels higher than existing swaps in current market rates. Turning to slide seven, we expect considerable runoff of lower yielding securities and swaps, which will allow us to continue to reinvest into higher yielding assets over the next couple of years. Accumulated other comprehensive income improved by approximately $2.4 billion, or 32% to negative $5.1 billion on September 30, compared to negative $7.4 billion on June 30. The linked quarter improvement in AOCI was primarily due to lower rates, which benefited our swap and available for sale portfolio valuations. Going forward, AOCI related to these securities and swaps, as well as our held to maturity portfolio will accrete back as they mature and prepay, resulting in further growth to tangible book value. Slide eight, covers our deposit balances in more detail. Average deposits increased $5 billion or 1%, reflecting an increase in interest-bearing commercial balances, as well as higher-time deposits. Regarding mic, non-interest-bearing deposits were stable at $96 billion and remained at 23% of total average deposits. Our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased 11 basis points during the third quarter to 2.72%, reflecting growth in commercial interest-bearing deposits. We believe our total rate paid on deposits has reached its peak level, and with the 50 basis point cut in September, we've already begun to reduce deposit pricing. Looking forward, we expect the Federal Reserve to cut the benchmark rate by 25 basis points at both the November and December meetings, which will accelerate deposit repricing, particularly within our high-beta commercial interest-bearing deposits. Turning to slide nine, we highlight our income statement trends. Third quarter net income was $1.5 billion or $3.49 per share, comparing the third quarter to the second quarter, total revenue of $5.4 billion increased $21 million. Net interest income grew by $108 million, or 3% and our net interest margin was 2.64%, an increase of 4 basis points. Fee income increased $176 million, or 10%. Other non-interest income was $69 million and included negative $128 million of visa related activity. Non-interest expense of $3.3 billion decreased $30 million, or 1%. As a result, PPNR grew 2% linked quarter, and we generated positive operating leverage for the third consecutive quarter. Provision was $243 million reflecting portfolio activity and our effective tax rate was 19.2%. Turning to slide 10, we highlight our revenue trends. Third quarter revenue increased $21 million, driven by higher fee and net interest income, partially offset by lower other non-interest income. Other non-interest income included negative $128 million of visa-related activity. Net interest income of $3.4 billion increased to $108 million, or 3% driven by higher yields on interest-earning assets. Fee income was $2 billion and increased $176 million or 10% linked quarter. Looking at the detail, asset management and brokerage income grew $19 million or 5%, reflecting favorable equity and fixed income market performance. Capital markets and advisory fees increased approximately $100 million, or 36% driven by higher M&A advisory activity, as well as broad growth across most categories. Card and cash management decreased $8 million or 1%, as higher treasury management revenue was more than offset by credit card origination incentives. Lending and deposit revenue grew $16 million or 5%, due to increased customer activity. Mortgage revenue was up $50 million linked quarter, driven by a $59 million increase in the valuation of net mortgage servicing rights. Other non-interest income of $69 million included visa derivatives fair value adjustments of negative $128 million, primarily related to visa's September announcement of a $1.5 billion litigation escrow funding. Notably, we continue to see strong momentum across our lines of business and throughout our markets. And year-to-date, non-interest income of $6 billion grew approximately $400 million or 7%, compared to the same period last year. Turning to slide 11, our non-interest expense of $3.3 billion declined $30 million or 1%. Excluding the second quarter $120 million contribution expense to the PNC Foundation, non-interest expense increased $90 million or 3% late quarter. Personnel expense increased $87 million or 5%, reflecting higher incentive compensation related to increased business activity. Importantly, all other categories declined or remain stable. Year-to-date, non-interest expense has increased by $80 million or 1%, excluding the $130 million FDIC special assessment and the $120 million foundation contribution expense in 2024. Non-interest expense is down 2% compared to the same period a year ago. We remain diligent in our continuous improvement efforts. We increased our CIP goal last quarter from $425 million to $450 million and we're on track to achieve that goal in 2024. As you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments. Our credit metrics are presented on slide 12. Non-performing loans increased $75 million or 3% linked quarter, primarily driven by an increase in CRE office loans. Total delinquencies of $1.3 billion were stable with June 30. Net loan charge-offs were $286 million, the $24 million linked quarter increase was driven primarily by lower commercial recoveries. And our annualized net charge-offs to average loans ratio was 36 basis points. Our allowance for credit loss is totaled $5.3 billion or 1.7% of total loans, on September 30 stable with June 30. Slide 13 provides more detail on our CRE office credit metrics. We continue to see stress in the office portfolio given the challenges inherent in this book and the lack of demand for office properties. CRE office criticized loans were essentially stable link quarter, but NPLs increased due to the migration of criticized loans to non-performing status. Net loan charge-offs within the CRE office portfolio were down slightly. However, going forward, we expect additional charge-offs on this book, the size of which will vary quarter-to-quarter given the nature of the loans. As of September 30, our reserves on the overall office portfolio were 11.3%, and inside of that 16% on the multi-tenant portfolio, both up slightly from prior quarter. The modest increase in reserves reflects the continued valuation adjustments across the portfolio and specific reserves for certain credits. Furthermore, CRE office balances declined 4%, or approximately $270 million, linked quarter as we continue to manage our exposure down. Accordingly, we believe we are adequately reserved. In summary, PNC reported a solid third quarter, regarding our view of the overall economy, we are expecting continued economic growth in the fourth quarter, resulting in real GDP growth of approximately 2% in 2024, and unemployment to remain slightly above 4% through year-end. We expect the Fed to cut rates two additional times in 2024, with a 25 basis point decrease in November and another in December. Looking at the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2024, we expect average loans to be stable, net interest income to be up approximately 1%, fee income to be down 5% to 7% due to the elevated third quarter capital markets and MSR levels. Other non-interest income to be in the range of $150 million and $200 million, excluding visa activity. Taking the component pieces of revenue together, we expect total revenue to be stable. We expect total non-interest expense to be up 2% to 3%. And we expect fourth quarter net charge-offs to be approximately $300 million. Importantly, considering our year-to-date results and fourth quarter expectations, we're on track to generate full-year positive operating leverage. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.\nErika Najarian: Hi. Good morning.\nRob Reilly: Good morning.\nErika Najarian: Rob, if we could just unpack a little bit of the commentary you made on the swap. So I guess the first part of this question is I noticed that the received fixed rate on your asset, on your active swaps went up quite a bit quarter-to-quarter implying that what's rolling off is well sub-one? You know, you went from 250 to 308. So I'm wondering if you could confirm that? And looking forward, I think you said something in your prepared remarks about replacing expiring \u201825 swaps at a higher fixed rate -- receive fixed rates, then you thought to maybe just clarify that statement as well?\nRob Reilly: Sure. Good morning, Erika. So, yes, you're right. And again, all of this in terms of your question points to what is occurring, which is that our repricing of our fixed rate assets, including our securities loans and swaps, is occurring at higher rates. So that's all of what we've been talking about for a while. True in terms of the swaps, new swaps are at a higher rate than the old swaps. And then as you recall back in the spring, we did execute some forward swaps that locked in rates for maturing assets in \u201825 that contribute to our statement, which we might as well confirm upfront, our NII being a record level in 2025, we're sticking to it.\nErika Najarian: Got it. Okay. And just the second part of my question that's the mechanical side now on the strategic side. Bill, it's been such a long time since the market has seen a neutral rate of not zero. You know, everybody's talked about deposit betas, but as we think about what the natural deposit cost is for PNC, how should we think about what the spread is? Let's say we settle at 2.75%, 3% in terms of Fed funds, what's the spread in terms of Fed funds versus your funding costs naturally? And additionally, just a quick follow-up to Rob, as we're in the liability side of the balance sheet, is there -- what drove the strength in deposits, and was that mostly corporate, and is that permanent balances, or is that sort of some corporate balance is just parked for now, given the uncertainty in the market?\nBill Demchak: I can't give a specific answer to where we might end up if rates, you know, Fed rates kind of hold it pre-end change, which I expect they will. You know, practically you can do most of that yourself, right? So the zero-cost deposits are obviously worth a lot more. If there's any steepness to the curve, we get that benefit with our fixed rate assets. So maybe inside of your question is all else equal if we end up in an environment where front rates are three and change and back rates are somewhat higher than that, that's the really attractive environment for banks, ourselves included.\nRob Reilly: Yes, and then the second part of that, Erika, was the outperformance that our deposit balances came on the commercial interest bearing side. As commercial clients continue to build cash on their balance sheet, our expectation is that'll hold for the most part through the end of the year.\nErika Najarian: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please proceed with your questions.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning.\nBill Demchak: Good morning, John.\nRob Reilly: Good morning, John.\nJohn Pancari: On the loan side, still balances are clearly still pressured and you flagged line utilization down a bps to 50.7 and below your historical? Can you maybe talk about the demand, the underlying demand trends that you are seeing? And what do you think is going to be the biggest catalyst to get borrowers off the sidelines in borrowing? Is it continued rate cuts, confidence in that front? Is it the election? If you could just maybe give us some thoughts there? And what do you think a growth rate is reasonable as you enter 2025? Thanks.\nRob Reilly: Hey, John, it's Rob. So, yes, you know, all year we've yet to deliver the loan growth that we thought was coming at some future point and for all the obvious reasons that you've seen utilization is low. And there is a bit of a pause feeling obviously with the election coming up and the rate environment. What we point to in terms of on the constructive front is we do continue to add customers, we do continue to add loan commitments quarter-over-quarter. So our commercial clients are putting those lines in place with the anticipation of borrowing. So that's a constructive sign. And then you've seen the low inventory levels, the low CapEx to sales levels. So it does feel as though we're at the point of the cycle to where, you know, loan growth is not too far off.\nJohn Pancari: Okay, got it, thanks Rob for that. And then separately, capital markets clearly has been a point of strength. Can you maybe just provide us a little bit of color on the pipeline there? And do you expect a pullback in the fourth quarter off these high levels? And just how should we figure out that? Thanks.\nRob Reilly: Yes, yes, we do. I'll expand that a little bit in terms of our fee guidance for the fourth quarter. So we're pointing it down 5% to 7% and all of that decline is being driven by the elevated MSR levels and the elevated capital markets levels that we achieve in the third quarter. So for the fourth quarter, you know, the MSRs is pretty straightforward. We don't expect to have those levels in the fourth quarter. And then on the capital market side, the short answer is we probably pulled a little bit of the fourth quarter activity into the third quarter. A lot of that is in our Harris Williams M&A advisory businesses that had a really strong third quarter, as well as some of the other broader capital markets stories. So it's a little bit lumpy. The pipelines, though, are strong. The momentum is strong. Capital markets year-over-year is up north of 23%. The back half of \u201824, including our capital markets guidance for the fourth quarter, is up 20% over the first half. So the momentum's there. It's just not necessarily going to fall linearly quarter-to-quarter.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. All right. Thanks, Rob.\nRob Reilly: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line at Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions.\nPiper Sandler: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to follow-up just a little bit on sort of the lending and deposit discussion. I guess first, just kind of qualitatively, do you have a sense for what a lending recovery might look like when it does come back? And I guess the context in that is I recall a time when bank loans used to grow at some multiple of GDP, but it's been quite a while since we've seen that. So maybe just some top level thoughts there? And then on the other side of the balance sheet, just maybe your sense for how deposit costs behave if lending does come back better? You all, and I think a lot of the industry, are great from a liquidity perspective, so curious how much competition factors into your thinking as well?\nBill Demchak: You know, we can come up with 10 different theories on why loan growth hasn't been there and why it might come back, but all of them are me making up theories. It's been below trend on utilization. There's a bunch of uncertainty, not the least of which is the election and rates and all the other things that may impact it. But it's, you know, it's one of the reasons why we kind of said, look, we'll you know, produce growth for our shareholders without having to rely on some made-up story as to why there might be loan growth. If there is, it's terrific, and at some point it'll come back, but I've given up trying to forecast it personally. On the funding side, we are very liquid, so we have an opportunity, should it arise. We have a lot of capital and cash and that would be a great thing for us you know I just move some balance at the Fed this\u2026\nRob Reilly: 35 spot 45 average, so a lot.\nBill Demchak: Yes, so I don't know that it's going to -- it would impact our funding costs whatsoever.\nPiper Sandler: Perfect okay good. All right thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.\nMatt O'Connor: Good morning. Any updated thoughts on where you think your net interest margin normalizes? I think at one point a couple months ago you said it could approach 3%. I think it was by the end of next year. But updated thoughts on that given the forward curve and your outlook for the mix of balance sheet? Thanks.\nRob Reilly: Yes, hey, Matt, it's Rob. I do recall you asking the question before, and the answer is going to be the same, which is, you know, our NIM is increasing. We don't manage the NIM as an outcome. We've operated close to 3%. My expectation is that we'll approach those levels. I don't remember saying by the end of \u201825, but maybe that's something that you added then, but we're on our way up, and 3% is reasonable through time.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay, and actually maybe it was by the end of \u201826 I had my no time to read. And then just separately, you've always been very strong in commercial lending and some of the few businesses that come from that. Consumer size has always been a little bit less of a focus, but I think you've been leaning in from areas like credit card around the edges and just any update thoughts in terms of what could be growth drivers as we think about consumer lending, consumer fees, the next couple of years? Thanks.\nBill Demchak: Yes, look, we've -- you know, historically we have under-invested in it and we've under -- we are under penetrated with our existing clients.\nRob Reilly: On consumer.\nBill Demchak: On consumer, yes. And that's our opportunity set. I don't know that we need to be heroic and go beyond that, but we ought to have the same penetration rate that our peers do with respect to our consumer lending. And there's fairly material upsides if we can pull that off and we're investing to be able to do so.\nRob Reilly: And we've introduced a new credit card and plans to continue to do that along those lines.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. When do you think you'll start seeing some of those efforts kick in? I mean, we are seeing pretty good credit card volume growth in the industry and at most peers, and obviously there's a little bit of a lag, but what do you think some of those efforts will be a little bit more evident?\nBill Demchak: I don't know that I have a timeline on it. I would tell you that we're investing in people. We're investing in our credit management capabilities and our marketing and our product delivery, you know, all of the above that will, you know, hopefully through time allow us to get the penetration we should have. I don't know what the timeline is on that, but I know it's a journey and I know we need to start it.\nRob Reilly: And we're at the beginning now.\nMatt O'Connor: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.\nBill Carcache: Thanks. Good morning, Bill and Rob. Following up on your loan growth commentary, you've had a lot of success over the years in taking share within C&I. If we do get a reacceleration in loan growth over, say, the next year or so. How does that influence your ability to continue to take share and perhaps outpace industry growth, recognizing your competitors are obviously not willingly ceding share?\nBill Demchak: Well, I think that will show up. We are growing DHE and winning new clients at a record pace, I think. So you know, when utilization comes back, we ought to, as we have in the past, my best guess is we would outperform.\nRob Reilly: Yes. Well, DHE is our loan commitment. They're unfunded at the moment, but they've been put in place. And I think the most of the momentum that we see is in our Southwest markets, where we are achieving record levels and would expect to be above average if it all plays out as we expect.\nBill Carcache: Thanks. That's helpful. And then separately on non-interest bearing deposits, you expect rates on your interest-bearing deposits to decline starting next quarter. But how long before you'd expect to see the effect of lower rates relating to compensating balances?\nRob Reilly: Yes, I don't know. That's a tough one to answer. I mean, what we're encouraged about is that we've clearly stabilized now for a couple of quarters at the levels that we are following several quarters of pretty substantial decline. So we've stabilized. There's a lot of theories in terms of what sort of the magic short-term rate is that kicks that up. But no one has a definitive answer.\nBill Carcache: Right, but is the credit that you give customers on compensating balances a sort of lever that you'd expect to use or be willing to use as you look to grow non-interest bearing deposits. Just trying to think through whether that's a potential something that could spur growth?\nBill Demchak: You should assume that crediting rate is below market versus open deposit rate. And so it's not going to have a moving beta for some period of time relative to rates coming down.\nRob Reilly: It's relatively constant and we're fine with that.\nBill Carcache: Okay, great. And If I could squeeze in one last one, if the NII trajectory that you laid out for 2025 plays out as anticipated. Is there any reason why, you know, the positive operating leverage commentary that you laid out is very helpful, but any reason why the efficiency ratio wouldn't get down into sort of that high-50% range? It seems like the math would suggest that, that could get there, but we would appreciate your thoughts?\nRob Reilly: We'll have to see, Bill. We're in the process of doing our budgeting for next year right now, so we'll have more for you on that in our January call.\nBill Carcache: Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.\nMike Mayo: Hi. I think, Bill, your prior comment that you expect record NII in 2025, do you feel more, less, or just as confident as before? And what sort of loan growth do you kind of assume for next year?\nBill Demchak: We wouldn't have said it if we didn't feel confident to begin with, so I don't know levels of confidence but we feel pretty good about that.\nRob Reilly: That's confident. That's for sure.\nBill Demchak: And we don't have any long growth in there whatsoever to get to that number.\nMike Mayo: So no loan growth for next year?\nBill Demchak: We have something, but it's\u2026\nRob Reilly: Well, we will have something, but the record NII level is not reliant on it.\nBill Demchak: Yes, it\u2019s not dependent on long growth.\nMike Mayo: Okay. And then back, I know, I think last quarter you used the word befuddled as to why long growth wasn't coming back. I guess number one could be the election, number two could be private credit, number three could be disintermediation of capital markets, number four, companies could just be managed differently today or number five, you could have a weaker economy or it could be all of the above. Just give us your best stab at why loan growth remains just so weak in an economy that's still growing?\nBill Demchak: I think all of your reasons other than three and four. I don't think private is causing utilization rate on middle market companies to remain low, for the businesses we play in. And I'm not sure, I mean at the margin, public markets being wide open has caused some of our larger clients to pay down outstanding balances and hit the capital market. So that's probably true at the margin. But this basic notion of people just aren't using working capital the way they used to. And maybe that's the way they run the company post-COVID. Maybe that's the uncertainty. It's going to play out over time. And we can all guess about it. I just don't know the answer, so I'm still befuddled.\nMike Mayo: Okay, and then lastly, your reserves on office CRE were taken even higher, especially multi-tenant. Last quarter you said the industry is in the first inning. I think a lot of people disagree with that. I'm not saying, yes, I'm not sure. We're two years into this at least and it's still a big question mark, I think, in a lot of people's minds. So when you said the industry's in the first inning and clearly your reserves are higher than others. Why do you say it's only the first hitting? What's your reasoning?\nBill Demchak: I think we're just now starting to clear buildings in sales, right? We've had some extensions, we've had maturities hitting, we have a whole slew of term loans in the CNBS market and with small banks that will be out there three, four, five, five years. I just think this plays out through over a long period of time. Office vacancies, pick your market, are quite high. And we're just now realizing the market-to-market value of that as we resolve properties. That's why we're reserved where we are and that's why I'm not worried about it per se from PNC standpoint, but no this is going to be noisy for a while.\nRob Reilly: I might refine that a little\u2026\nMike Mayo: Go ahead.\nRob Reilly: Early innings. Early innings, yes.\nBill Demchak: But we're not, I mean, importantly, we're not in early innings with respect to how we're reserved, yes. I mean, you know, you can love or hate, but you know, to the best of our ability, we've taken all that up front.\nMike Mayo: And then sneaking one more last one. As far as acquisitions, I know you'd like to buy them on the cheap. I mean, national city, you know, you go down the list. It's getting tougher for you to buy things on the cheap. Maybe if you, a bank does have a office or CRE problem that you swoop in there, but am I right in thinking it's a lot less likely you do an acquisition now that some of these stocks have come back or what you're thinking?\nBill Demchak: Yes, you're right. We don't see value in an acquisition at the moment.\nMike Mayo: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next questions come from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with the Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Hey, good morning. I guess maybe just one Rob for you as a follow up on deposit pricing. I think a fair amount of uncertainty around how much banks will be able to flex deposit costs lower. We got the September cut. Remind us one around your beta expectations and any early proof points on how customers and especially commercial customers have received the lower rates over the last few weeks?\nRob Reilly: Sure. So, you know, we're early on, just a couple of weeks out from the rate cut. But now we're in a down beta cycle. You know, we said that we think that our terminal data will be approximately 50%, and we will reduce rates paid through the balance of this year, and maybe we get a little bit less than half of the way there by the end of 2024. But that's going to play out. It's early, but that's sort of our thinking. So, you know, rate paid will be coming down, particularly in the higher interest bearing commercial deposits, some wealth deposits, and that's underway, and we'd expect that to continue.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it, and on commercial clients, so how do you around loan growth and all the reasons why loan growth may or may not pick up? If you don't mind just speaking to the health of the commercial customer base and whether some of the macro data around jobs could be a bit misleading, like when you talk to your C&I customers, are they, like are the balance sheets healthy? Like do they, if the Fed were to pause rate cuts after a cut or two, does that increase the risk for these customers and how they might approach investing, hiring, et cetera. Would love any color you can share.\nBill Demchak: I guess it maybe it varies by industry, but a simple notion is companies at the margin are losing margin, right? They have an end, they can't pass on prices like they once could, they're not making it up in volume. So the discussion of how do I cut costs has at least entered the dialogue. But we haven't seen that show up in layoffs, right? The data remains strong, and as long as the data is strong, consumers are spending and the economy is strong. So everybody's staring and watching and looking and there's margin pressure on corporates. But there's no -- we don't see in conversations some pending big layoff spike hitting the U.S. economy. There's specific industries that are in slumps, whether it's transportation, health care, struggling consumer state, they're at the margin, but that's -- it's just at the margin.\nRob Reilly: And nothing new.\nBill Demchak: Yes.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it, Got it. And if one last one, just following up on Mike's question on M&A. Bank transactions usually stock for stock. I mean, your stock's done well. Why would a deal, given your history and track record on deal integration, like is it just completely ruled out at this point? Is there a willing seller acquiring a good franchise? Does it no longer make sense just because of pricing?\nBill Demchak: Yes, it\u2019s -- I mean, the fact that we have a multiple advantage, our stock is worth the money it trades at. I'm not sure other stocks are. So straight up financial math saying it works doesn't mean it's a good deal. And when we look at potential targets, it would be interesting from certain geographies and so forth. They just don't pencil out when you look at their balance sheet and the amount of investment we'd have to put in the franchise and just the time sync it takes to do it. So I, you know, and by the way, we look at everything. I don't think the market's anywhere close where we'd find something attractive.\nRob Reilly: Or pay a premium on top of what you think is already a premium priced in.\nBill Demchak: Yes.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That's fair. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\nBetsy Graseck: Oh, hi. Thanks so much. Okay, great. Just to follow-up on the last question. So, right, doesn't make sense, M&A, right now in this environment given. Well, whatever, I won't go there. But just the underlying question is organic growth. How do you see your organic growth progressing over the medium term? Are there legs to acceleration or what we're seeing today is a good run rate?\nBill Demchak: No, there's legs on acceleration certainly in C&I as we continue to build out these new markets, what you're going to see us do is more aggressively invest into our retail distribution franchise, very targeted and high-volume branch builds in particular markets. At the moment, go back to somebody's question of, hey, what if rates are [3.25%] (ph) at the front end and what do you earn on deposits? The break even on a branch has become a lot easier to achieve. And my historical comments on the need for scale are still true. It just looks like the way we're going to have to get there, at least in the near-term, is through investment and organic growth. And we're good at it. We've been executing on it. And we'll just continue on.\nRob Reilly: Particularly in the Southwest markets where the momentum is very strong across all our businesses CNIB, retail and the private bank.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay, great. Thanks so much. Yes.\nBill Demchak: Same here.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\nGerard Cassidy: Hi, Rob. Hi, Bill.\nBill Demchak: Hey, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: You guys have done a very good job in managing credit over the years and it shows up again this quarter. Can we take a look at, in the C&I portfolio, what are the trends that you guys might be seeing in your [SNIC] (ph) portfolio or the asset-backed portfolio or the leverage portfolio, the trend is pretty benign. What do you guys see in there?\nBill Demchak: Not much. At the margin, we still have more downgrades than upgrades, a very simple ratio across that whole book. Much of that is driven by margin compression as opposed to anything fundamental with the underlying company. But now the economy is healthy, and company and our portfolio is healthy. We'll have lumpy one-offs. There's always some story that happens and we had one of those this quarter actually. But overall, the portfolio feels pretty strong.\nRob Reilly: And just to clarify with those.\nBill Demchak: Go ahead, Robert.\nRob Reilly: Yes, they're still very acceptable bookable credits. They're just not as strong as the ultra-strong they were. Now, the last time I read them.\nGerard Cassidy: Got it. And I know you touched on this on commercial loan growth about companies might be stronger. Have you seen any evidence that because of the pandemic, because of what companies went through your longtime customers that you've talked to for years, do you actually see them better managed or stronger, because of what happened during the pandemic?\nBill Demchak: I think that almost has to be true. And certainly, part of the answer to the utilization question, by the way has to be the notion that basically working capital was free for a bunch of years, and all of a sudden it got expensive. So you're looking at places where you can improve margin and you're trying to cut your borrowings and be more efficient at what you're running in inventory and investment. So companies did without a lot of stuff during the pandemic and then you learn from that and you try to keep to insight. Yes, we'll see. But broader messages, the economy's fine, companies are fine, labor still feels strong. You know, a lot of things in the geopolitical horizons that could disrupt that, but those are exogenous variables to the basic economy we operate in.\nGerard Cassidy: Great, and just a final follow-up. You gave us some good data, of course, on the Commercial Real Estate Office portfolio. What kind of impact, I guess, if the cap rates start to come down, when do you start to see that be beneficial for the commercial? I mean, where it could really help you -- help the values of those properties. I know each property is different, vacancy rates are critical, but is there any kind of point that you guys look at that if the cap rates fell 100 basis points or 150, that would help the valuation process?\nBill Demchak: Look, lower cap rate at the margin is to help. I think what you're running into though is you'll have office buildings that if they're 50% vacant, they'll hit the market and the question will be, can they ever get to normal occupancy through historical absorption rates? And if the answer to that is no, then the value of that building, we just saw one in New York, is next to zero. If there's a tail on absorption where yes, I think I can rehab it and get this thing back to my normal 90%, 95%, then it has value as a going concern and it's worth something. The cap rate almost is irrelevant in those two scenarios. If the thing is never going to be occupied, it doesn't matter what the cap rate's worth, it's worth land.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good, good insights, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back over to Bryan Gill for any closing comments.\nBryan Gill: Okay, well thank you all for participating on the call this quarter and feel free to reach out to the IR team if you have any follow-up questions.\nBill Demchak: Thanks a lot everybody.\nRob Reilly: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Bill Demchak",
            "content": "Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we had a very good third quarter. We executed well and saw a strong momentum across our franchise. We generated $1.5 billion in net income worth $3.49, diluted earnings per share. Rob will take you through the details shortly, but I wanted to highlight a few points. First, we generated positive operating leverage for the third consecutive quarter. And as an aside, our strong performance has positioned us to deliver positive operating leverage for the full-year of 2024. Inside of the third quarter performance NII grew 3% as we continue our growth trajectory towards expected record NII in 2025. Our fee income grew 10% with a very strong quarter in capital markets and we remain disciplined on the expense front. Second, we continue to see strong growth and activity across our franchise. CNIB continues to have great momentum as new loan production and commitments increased this quarter. While overall loan utilization has remained soft, the recent Fed actions to lower interest rates and the expectation of further cuts is likely to spur greater demand as we move ahead. Importantly, we are well positioned to serve our customers when loan growth returns. Within retail, we continue to invest heavily in our branch network to build density in our most attractive growth markets, and we are seeing success. We continue to grow customer households and checking accounts with the highest customer growth being realized in the Southwest markets. AMG is accelerating growth in high-opportunity markets and benefiting from favorable equity markets. Third, our overall credit quality remains relatively stable, reflecting our thoughtful approach to managing risk, customer selection, and long-term relationship development. While we expect additional charge-offs in the CRE office segment, we're adequately reserved. Lastly, we continued to strengthen our capital levels during the quarter, and with the ongoing improvement in AOCI, our tangible book value per share increased 9%. In summary, we delivered strong results in the quarter, and we remain well positioned to continue our momentum. In fact, we're in the middle of our strategic planning process and I can't recall a time when our organic growth opportunities have ever been more attractive. Now before I turn it over to Rob for more detail on the financial results and outlook, I'd like to say thank you to our employees for everything that they do for our customers and our company. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob to take you through the quarter. Rob? I can't give a specific answer to where we might end up if rates, you know, Fed rates kind of hold it pre-end change, which I expect they will. You know, practically you can do most of that yourself, right? So the zero-cost deposits are obviously worth a lot more. If there's any steepness to the curve, we get that benefit with our fixed rate assets. So maybe inside of your question is all else equal if we end up in an environment where front rates are three and change and back rates are somewhat higher than that, that's the really attractive environment for banks, ourselves included. Good morning, John. You know, we can come up with 10 different theories on why loan growth hasn't been there and why it might come back, but all of them are me making up theories. It's been below trend on utilization. There's a bunch of uncertainty, not the least of which is the election and rates and all the other things that may impact it. But it's, you know, it's one of the reasons why we kind of said, look, we'll you know, produce growth for our shareholders without having to rely on some made-up story as to why there might be loan growth. If there is, it's terrific, and at some point it'll come back, but I've given up trying to forecast it personally. On the funding side, we are very liquid, so we have an opportunity, should it arise. We have a lot of capital and cash and that would be a great thing for us you know I just move some balance at the Fed this... Yes, so I don't know that it's going to -- it would impact our funding costs whatsoever. Yes, look, we've -- you know, historically we have under-invested in it and we've under -- we are under penetrated with our existing clients. On consumer, yes. And that's our opportunity set. I don't know that we need to be heroic and go beyond that, but we ought to have the same penetration rate that our peers do with respect to our consumer lending. And there's fairly material upsides if we can pull that off and we're investing to be able to do so. I don't know that I have a timeline on it. I would tell you that we're investing in people. We're investing in our credit management capabilities and our marketing and our product delivery, you know, all of the above that will, you know, hopefully through time allow us to get the penetration we should have. I don't know what the timeline is on that, but I know it's a journey and I know we need to start it. Well, I think that will show up. We are growing DHE and winning new clients at a record pace, I think. So you know, when utilization comes back, we ought to, as we have in the past, my best guess is we would outperform. You should assume that crediting rate is below market versus open deposit rate. And so it's not going to have a moving beta for some period of time relative to rates coming down. We wouldn't have said it if we didn't feel confident to begin with, so I don't know levels of confidence but we feel pretty good about that. And we don't have any long growth in there whatsoever to get to that number. We have something, but it's... Yes, it's not dependent on long growth. I think all of your reasons other than three and four. I don't think private is causing utilization rate on middle market companies to remain low, for the businesses we play in. And I'm not sure, I mean at the margin, public markets being wide open has caused some of our larger clients to pay down outstanding balances and hit the capital market.

Maybe that's the uncertainty. It's going to play out over time. And we can all guess about it. I just don't know the answer, so I'm still befuddled. I think we're just now starting to clear buildings in sales, right? We've had some extensions, we've had maturities hitting, we have a whole slew of term loans in the CNBS market and with small banks that will be out there three, four, five, five years. I just think this plays out through over a long period of time. Office vacancies, pick your market, are quite high. And we're just now realizing the market-to-market value of that as we resolve properties. That's why we're reserved where we are and that's why I'm not worried about it per se from PNC standpoint, but no this is going to be noisy for a while.

Thank you, Bryan, you may begin.\nBryan Gill: Well, good morning. Welcome to today's conference call for The PNC Financial Services Group. I am Bryan Gill, the Director of Investor Relations for PNC, and participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO.

These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com under invest relations. These statements speak only as of April 16, 2024, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\nWilliam Demchak : Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we had a strong second quarter, and we generated $1.5 billion in net income, or $3.39 diluted earnings per share. Our results included a gain on a portion of our Visa Class B shares, which was substantially offset by other items in the quarter, including a securities repositioning. Rob is going to provide more details on that Visa gain financial results and outlook in a second, but I'll highlight a few items. First off, net interest income has moved past its trough, and both NII and NIM grew in the quarter. And by the way, this would have occurred independent of the $10 million impact that we got from the securities repositioning. Importantly, we are on a growth trajectory towards expected record NII in 2025. We continue to add new customers and see strong business momentum across our franchise, particularly in the new and expansion markets. [DDA] (ph) growth accelerated in our branches and we continue to add new corporate and commercial banking clients above historical rates. In our retail business, we launched our first new credit card in several years, PNC Cash Unlimited, a highly competitive card that offers 2% back on all purchases. We plan to launch several new cards in the months and year ahead. Average deposits held relatively flat to the first quarter levels, a little bit ahead of our expectations. And our expenses remained well controlled and we generated positive operating leverage during the second quarter. Rob is going to touch on this in a minute, but we have increased our continuous improvement program target for 2024 as expense discipline remains a top priority. The credit environment continues to play out as we have expected, including an increase in charge-offs within the CRE office portfolio, where we remain adequately reserved. Outside of CRE office, credit quality remains relatively stable. Finally, we further strengthen our capital levels during the quarter. Our strong balance sheet allows us to continue supporting our customers and communities, investing in our business and people, and delivering returns for shareholders. Our financial strength and stability are also reflected in the latest results from the Fed stress test in which we maintained our stress capital buffer at the regulatory minimum of 2.5% and importantly for the second year in a row, PNC has had the lowest start to trough capital depletion in our peer group, further demonstrating our best-in-class resiliency. With this in mind, our board recently approved an increase in our quarterly stock dividend by $0.05. In summary, we delivered strong results in the second quarter and are well positioned to drive further growth and expansion into 2025 and beyond. Before I turn it over to Rob, as always, I just want to thank our employees for everything they do for our company and our customers. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob to take you through the quarter. Rob?\nRobert Reilly: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average linked quarter basis. Loans of $320 billion were stable. Investment securities increased $6 billion or 4%. And our cash balances at the Federal Reserve were $41 billion, a decrease of $7 billion or 15%, primarily reflecting the deployment of cash into higher-yielding securities. Deposit balances averaged $417 billion, a decline of $3 billion or less than 1% due to a seasonal decline in corporate balances. Borrowed funds increased $2 billion or 2% and were 15% of total liabilities. At quarter end, AOCI was negative $7.4 billion and improved $600 million compared with March 31st. Our tangible book value increased $89.12 per common share, a 4% increased linked quarter, and a 15% increase compared to the same period a year ago. We remain well capitalized and our estimated CET1 ratio increased to 10.2% as of June 30th. Regarding the Basel III end-game, we expect the inclusion of AOCI in the final rule and our CET1 ratio with the impact of AOCI would be 8.7%. And while we recognize the likelihood of changes to certain other aspects of the Basel III end-game NPR, under the currently proposed capital rules, our estimated fully phased-in expanded risk-based CET1 ratio would be approximately 8.4%. We continue to be well positioned with capital flexibility. We returned roughly $700 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter, which included $600 million in common dividends and $100 million of share repurchases. And as Bill just mentioned, our board recently approved a $0.05 increase to our quarterly cash dividend on common stock, raising the dividend to $1.60 per share. Our recent CCAR results underscores the strength of our balance sheet and as previously announced our current stress capital buffer remains at the regulatory minimum of 2.5% for the four quarter period beginning in October 2024. Slide 5 shows our loans in more detail. Compared to the first quarter, average loan balances were stable. Commercial loans were essentially flat as utilization remains well below both the pre-pandemic historical average of roughly 55% and the second quarter 2023 level of 52.5%. Importantly, we continue to grow customer relationships and CNIB loan commitments increase during the second quarter. Although the direction of the near-term economy remains uncertain, CapEx to sales levels and inventory growth rates remain below historical averages, both of which are typically leading indicators of eventual commercial loan growth. Average consumer loans declined approximately $600 million or less than 1%, driven by lower residential real estate and home equity loan balances. And the yield on total loans increased 4 basis points to 6.05% in the second quarter. Slide 6 details our investment security and swap portfolios. Average investment securities of $141 billion increased $6 billion, or 4%, reflecting the deployment of excess liquidity into higher-yielding securities, primarily U.S. treasuries. The securities portfolio yield increased 22 basis points to 2.84%, driven by higher rates on new purchases. As of June 30th, the securities portfolio duration was 3.5 years. During the second quarter, our forward starting swaps increased to $18 billion. With the addition of these swaps, we've locked in a portion of our fixed rate asset repricing through 2025 at a level that is approximately 300 basis points higher than maturity. The total weighted average received fixed rate of our swap portfolio, including the forward starters, increased 83 basis points to 3.13% and the duration of the portfolio is 2.2 years. Slide 7 highlights the securities repositioning we executed during the second quarter. We sold securities with a book value of $4.3 billion and a market value of $3.8 billion. We recognized a $497 million loss on the sale and reinvested the $3.8 billion of proceeds into securities, with yields approximately 400 basis points higher than the securities sold. The reposition is expected to benefit our net interest income by $80 million in 2024, with roughly $10 million of that being realized in the second quarter. And the estimated earn-back period for this transaction is less than four years. Turning to Slide 8, we expect considerable runoff of low-yielding securities and swaps through the end of 2026, which will allow us to continue to reinvest into higher-yielding assets, providing a meaningful benefit to net interest income. Accumulated other comprehensive income improved to negative $7.4 billion on June 30th, compared to negative $8 billion on March 31st. The improvement was primarily due to the securities repositioning. AOCI will continue to accrete back as our securities and swaps mature, resulting in further growth to tangible book value. Slide 9 covers our deposits in more detail. Average deposits declined $3 billion or 1% reflecting seasonally lower corporate balances. Regarding mix, consolidated non-interest bearing deposits were 23% of total deposits in the second quarter, down less than 1 percentage point from the first quarter. Additionally, average non-interest bearing deposits had the smallest dollar decline in the second quarter of 2024 since the Fed began raising rates in 2022, which gives us confidence that the non-interest bearing portion of our deposits has largely stabilized. And our rate paid on interest bearing deposits increased by only 1 basis point during the second quarter to 2.61%. We believe our rate paid on deposits is approaching its peak level, but we do expect some potential to [drift] (ph) higher as interest rates remain elevated. Turning to the income statement, and as Bill mentioned, there were several significant items in the quarter, and I want to provide a bit more detail. Taken together, these significant items have a minimal impact to our earnings per share, totaling to a net EPS benefit of $0.09. As we previously disclosed, we participated in the Visa exchange program, allowing us to monetize 50% of our Visa Class B-1 shares and convert our remaining holdings to 1.8 million Visa Class B-2 shares. Through the exchange we recognized a $754 million pre-tax gain. In addition, we had significant items that occurred in the second quarter that largely offset the gain, and they are as follows: First, as I mentioned earlier, we repositioned a portion of our securities portfolio and through the sale of certain low-yielding securities recognized a $497 million loss. Second, we recorded a negative $116 million Visa derivative fair value adjustment associated with Visa Class B-2 shares, primarily related to the extension of anticipated litigation resolution. And lastly, we recognize the $120 million PNC Foundation contribution expense. The foundation supports our communities and early childhood education. Turning to Slide 11, we highlight our income statement trends. Second quarter net income was $1.5 billion or $3.39 per share. Total revenue of $5.4 billion increased $266 million or 5% compared to the first quarter of 2024. Net interest income grew by $38 million, or 1% in the second quarter. Notably, this is the first time NII has increased in six quarters, marking the beginning of an expected upward trajectory. And our net interest margin was 2.6% an increase of 3 basis points. Non-interest income increased $228 million, or 12%, and included $141 million of the significant items I previously detailed. Noninterest expense of $3.4 billion increased $23 million, or 1%, and included the $120 million foundation contribution expense. Notably, we generated positive operating leverage in both the linked quarter and year-over-year comparisons. Provision was $235 million in the second quarter, reflecting portfolio activity, and our effective tax rate was 18.8%. Turning to Slide 12, we highlight our revenue trends. Second quarter revenue was up $266 million or 5%, driven by higher non-interest income and net interest income. Net interest income of $3.3 billion increased $38 million or 1%, driven by higher yields on interest earning assets. Fee income was $1.8 billion and increased $31 million or 2% linked quarter. Looking at the detail, asset management and brokerage and non-interest income was stable late quarter, as the benefit of higher average equity markets was offset by lower annuity sales due to elevated first quarter activity. Capital markets and advisory fees increased $13 million or 5%, driven by higher M&A advisory activity and loan syndications, partially offset by lower underwriting fees. Card and cash management increased $35 million, or 5%, reflecting seasonally higher consumer transaction volumes and higher treasury management fees. Mortgage revenue declined $16 million or 11%, primarily due to lower residential mortgage activity. Other noninterest income of $332 million increased to $197 million and included $141 million related to this quarter's significant items. Turning to Slide 13, our non-interest expense of $3.4 billion was well controlled, increasing by only $23 million or 1%. Expenses for the second quarter included the $120 million contribution to the PNC Foundation, while the first quarter of 2024 included $130 million FDIC special assessment. Importantly, non-interest expense excluding the foundation contribution declined $135 million or 4% compared with the second quarter of 2023. Notably, personnel declined as a result of the workforce reduction actions we took last year. As Bill mentioned, we remain diligent in our continuous improvement efforts. At the beginning of the year, we set a continuous improvement program goal of $425 million. Recently, we have identified initiatives that support increasing our CIP by an additional $25 million, raising our full-year target to $450 million. As you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 14. Non-performing loans increased $123 million or 5% linked quarter, primarily driven by an individual secured loan within our asset-based lending business. Total delinquencies of $1.3 billion were stable with March 31. Net loan charge-offs were $262 million in the second quarter and included $106 million of net charge-offs related to our CRE office portfolio. And our annualized net charge-off to average loans ratio was 33 basis points. Our allowance for credit losses total $5.4 billion, or 1.7% of total loans on June 30th, stable with March 31st. Slide 15 provides more detail on our CRE office credit metrics. CRE office NPLs were stable in the second quarter, as charged off and paydowns offset inflows to non-performing loans. And the migration of criticized loans to non-performing status is an expected outcome as we work to resolve the challenges inherent to this portfolio. As expected, net loan charge-offs within the CRE office portfolio increased and totaled $106 million in the second quarter. Ultimately, we expect additional charge-offs on this portfolio, the size of which will vary quarter-to-quarter given the nature of the loans. As of June 30, our reserves on the office portfolio were 10.3% of total office loans, and inside of that, 15.5% on the multi-tenant portfolio. Accordingly, we believe we are adequately reserved. Importantly, we continue to manage our exposure down, and as a result, our balance has declined 4% or approximately $300 million linked quarter. In summary, PNC posted a solid second quarter 2024 and we're well positioned for the second half of the year. Regarding our view of the overall economy, we're expecting continued economic growth in the second half of the year, resulting in real GDP growth of approximately 2% in 2024, and unemployment to increase modestly to slightly above 4% by year-end. We expect the Fed to cut rates 2 times in 2024, with a 25 basis point decrease in September and another in December. Looking at the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024, we expect average loans to be stable, net interest income to be up 1% to 2%, fee income to be up 1% to 2%, other non-interest income to be in the range of $150 million and $200 million, excluding Visa and securities activity. We expect core non-interest expense to be up 3% to 4%. We expect third quarter net charge-offs to be between $250 million and $300 million. Regarding our full-year guidance, for ease of comparability to prior guidance, we exclude the first quarter FDIC special assessment, as well as the second quarter Visa gain and other significant items. Considering our reported first half operating results, third quarter expectations, and current economic forecasts, our full year 2024 guidance is as follows: For the full year 2024 compared to full year 2023, we expect average loans to be down less than 1%, which equates to nominal loan growth in the second half of 2024. We recognize the potential for greater loan growth, and should that occur, it will be accreted to our full year average. Despite lower expected loan volumes, we expect full year NII to be at the better end of our previous expectations, or down approximately 4%. We expect our securities repositioning and better than expected deposit dynamics to offset the impact of a lower than expected loan volume. We expect non-interest income to be up 3% to 5%, slightly lower than our previous guidance due to continued softness and mortgage activity and to a lesser extent, loan-related capital market fees. As a result, total revenue is expected to be down 1% to 2% and inside the range of our previous guidance. We now expect core non-interest expense to be down approximately 1% versus our previous guidance of stable, in part due to our increased CIP target. And we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18.5%. With that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nWilliam Demchak: Hey, good morning, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: So on NII, I know you guided to the upper end of the range, even though you've got slower loan growth, clearly due to your NIM improving. At least that's one driver. There's others as well. I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about the securities restructuring from here? Is this something that you would consider continuing or is it -- we should look at it as a one-off from -- using the Visa gains? And I ask just from the context of trying to think through NIM trajectory from here. Thanks.\nWilliam Demchak: You should think of it as a one-off. I mean, you never say never and I don't know what the future holds, but practically at this point, we don't have to do any restructuring on anything to hit that stated goal of the 2025 record NII.\nRobert Reilly: And we don't have any plans to do that.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay, great. And then could you speak to how you're thinking about deposit pricing and levels. I mean, clearly there was tax related outflows and things like that this quarter, and with loan growth being muted, should we be anticipating deposits stable to down, or are you going to be out there trying to get deposit growth, just again, asking from the context of how we should think about deposit pricing as we work through our models? Thanks so much.\nWilliam Demchak: Yes. Sure, Betsy. I would say the short answer to that is, stable to down is our expectation with an emphasis on stable. Things have really stabilized year-over-year as you know. So our expectation is, some downward drift but not anywhere near the level that we've seen in the last couple of years.\nBetsy Graseck: Got it. All right. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.\nWilliam Demchak: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning.\nWilliam Demchak: Hi, John.\nJohn Pancari: On your NII outlook, it's good to hear the NII inflection and the confidence there, excluding the $70 million benefits from the securities repositioning in the back half of this year. I mean, it appears that the underlying NII run rate for the back half was guided a bit lower. Is that mainly loan growth that's the driver? I mean, if you could just talk through that a little bit in terms of the factors impacting that run rate.\nWilliam Demchak: Well, I could [Multiple Speakers]\nRobert Reilly: It wasn't -- If you backed out the restructuring, the guide would still be higher. And we did that while muting our loan growth assumption. And we did that because we kind of just got tired of saying that, hey, loan growth is going to come at some point. So we took it out of the forecast. If it shows up, we will benefit like everybody else.\nWilliam Demchak: I think that's an important point. That's the big difference in this quarter. We changed our guidance for average loans to be up 1% or approximately 1% for the year, John. As you can see now, down less than 1%. We don't control that. There's a basis for some loan growth in the second half of the year. But the important point is, we've taken it out of our guidance and our NII improved to the better end of the previous guidance, not just due to the securities restructuring, but also the positive deposit dynamics and so forth.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. All right. Now, thanks for the clarification. It helps. And then just separately on the capital front, clearly the AOCI benefit from the securities repositioning is certainly noted. How do you feel now in terms of the pace of buybacks as you look out, just given where you stand now on CET1 and from a fully phased in, how does it make you feel about the pace of buybacks here? Could it remain at the $100 million pace per quarter or possibly accelerate?\nRobert Reilly: Yes. I mean, right now we're on pace and we continue to -- we expect to continue the pace that we've been on for the first couple of quarters. And as you know, the new rules are still in flux, so there's not finalization there. And then beyond that, I think, a driver will be what happens with loan growth, which would be a factor in terms of that being our highest and best use of our capital. But that'll be a factor in terms of deciding on buybacks. But the important part is that we are buying back shares.\nWilliam Demchak: Yes, I think, John, just on buybacks, I mean, at some point, I got to believe loan growth comes back. But to the extent it doesn't, we're generating a lot of capital, obviously, in excess of our dividend. And we'll face that question. If we're not using that capital for loan growth, should we accelerate deployment and buybacks? We're not there yet, but that happens down the road if loan growth doesn't materialize because we're generating a lot of capital.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. Okay, that's helpful. Thanks, Bill.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.\nErika Najarian: Hi. Good morning.\nWilliam Demchak: Good morning.\nErika Najarian: Good morning. Going back to Slide 9, I presume that the stabilization in deposit rates fade, which is quite notable as part of the upgrade of the core NII guide, even without the restructuring. And you answered Rob, Betsy's question, I gather, on a balances standpoint, but perhaps give us a sense on how you think deposit rate paid will trend from here and maybe under the scenario of rates staying where we are versus the scenario of what the forward curve is pricing and how quickly you may be able to reprice?\nRobert Reilly: Yes, sure. Our plan -- so Slide 9 is a good slide and that clearly shows a decline in the increase of the rate paid. The short answer to one of your questions there is, we do expect the rates [indiscernible] drift up a little bit, but in contrast it's more like a handful of basis points versus the contrast to the previous quarters where you see 60 or 50 and even 30 in recent quarters. So it's slowed down considerably. That's our expectation in the short-term, Erika. When we get into rate cuts, we'll see -- we'll be able to move pretty quickly on the high rates paid on commercial and [indiscernible]. But we still do have these interest-bearing consumer deposits that are below market that will grind higher. So that's something that we've talked about before and just something that we'll need to keep our eye on.\nErika Najarian: Got it. And my second question is, it refers back to Slide 6 in terms of the forward starters. When I look back at your 10-Q disclosure, it seems like you're largely neutral to interest rates. And I know that you and Bill have talked a lot about the different factors that drive the inflection point in the Nike Swoosh. I'm wondering if the addition of the $18 billion in forward starters with the received fix of $4.31 billion, does that impact the magnitude of the Swoosh for 2025?\nWilliam Demchak: That's a good question.\nRobert Reilly: Well, my answer to that would not necessarily be the magnitude, but the certainty. So essentially what we've done is locked in some of the swoosh.\nWilliam Demchak: Probably 50 basis points ago. One of the issues, of course, when everybody talks about fixed rate asset repricing is, what is it repriced to? And of course, therefore, we are exposed to whatever that five-year rate is, a year and two out. And those forward starting swaps simply with a very opportunistic point locked in materially higher rates than where we are today. To Rob's point, that just locks in the certainty of what we'll be able to produce on a go-forward basis.\nErika Najarian: Got it. And Bill, I think that's such a good point, because I think when people are taking a fixed asset repricing, sometimes they misthink about the $525 million as opposed to whatever. It could be at four, right, by the end of next year. And to that -- to your point, you've locked in a certainty. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question come from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions.\nScott Siefers: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Rob I was hoping you could maybe touch on sort of major fee components in light of the software expectation. I mean, it sounds like it's just a -- or mostly a function of mortgage, which sort of is what it is. But just curious to hear sort of what do you think is going well? What will need a heavy lift? That kind of thing.\nRobert Reilly: Yes, it's mostly a refinement, Scott. So, for the full year guide around the fees, we lowered our expectations of increase, as you know, from up 4% to 6% to up 3% to 5%. So still up and a small shift. Most of that coming from continued softness in mortgage, which we expect to be on the -- continue in the balance half or second half of the year, a little bit less than what we were expecting. To a lesser extent tied to the reduced loan guidance, we do have loan-related fees within our capital market segment, think loan syndication. So generally speaking, if there's fewer loans, there'll be fewer loan syndication fees. So that's just a direct correlation there to that guide. And again, we could see loan growth, and if that's the case, then those fees would come back. But that's the general thinking, everything else on schedule, so to speak.\nScott Siefers: Okay. Perfect. Thank you, Rob. And I wanted to ask a little bit of a kind of fine-pointed one on loan growth. I think, Bill, in your sort of prepared remarks, you noted the introduction of your first new credit card in a while, as well as plans to introduce more. Can you sort of contextualize your aspirations for that business and sort of the path to get there over time?\nWilliam Demchak: Yes, I mean, basically we want to have our fair share of consumer lending products with the clients we serve in our traditional DDA and other products. And we don't today. We're there on home equity. We're probably close in mortgage. We're under-prevented in auto and in card and in card in particular, we just haven't had good offerings. We've had stale technology, we've had slow -- we need to improve and it's an opportunity for us.\nScott Siefers: Okay. All right. Perfect. All right. Thank you guys very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question come from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with the Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning.\nWilliam Demchak: Good morning.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess, maybe, Rob, it looks like you've locked in a lot of asset repricing. As we think about where the NIM should normalize relative to 2.6%, give us a sense, I mean, you probably have this number. Do we hit 3% at some point next year in terms of what the normalized rate would be? And can we get to a 3% plus NIM next year, even with maybe four or five rate cuts?\nRobert Reilly: Sure. So, we don't necessarily provide NIM guidance, because it's more an outcome than anything. But to answer your question, we've operated in, call it a normal environment at a 3% NIM margin. So if we definitely expect to go up into 2025, if we approach those levels, it won't be like we haven't been there before. So it's reasonable.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. And just one quick one on credit quality. I think I heard Bill say not a whole lot ex-CRE office, but give us a sense if you're seeing any cracks within the C&I customer base from the prolonged period of like just higher for longer rates, just how do you handicap the risk of a downturn or a recession over the coming months or the next year?\nWilliam Demchak: Yes. So, when we take a look at our total reserves and our total portfolio, CRE office aside, things are pretty stable. Maybe on quarter-to-quarter basis, consumers are a little bit better, commercial non-CRE is a little bit worse, but not bad. So, definitely some more movements, some downgrades reflecting the higher rates, slower economic activity in our commercial book, but no patterns or any themes to point out.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. An outlook for reserves is stable from [indiscernible]\nWilliam Demchak: Reserves are stable, yes.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. Thank you.\nWilliam Demchak: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question come from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.\nBill Carcache: Thanks. Good morning, Bill and Rob. Following up on your NIM and NII commentary, is there a point as we start to get cuts where you would start to worry that those rate cuts would potentially begin to negate some of the repricing benefit? And then separately, amid the debate over whether the curve is going to steepen or flatten depending on the outcome of the election. Maybe could you just give us a little bit of a perspective on how PNC is positioned for either a flatter or a steeper yield curve environment?\nWilliam Demchak: Sure. We are largely indifferent. I mean, at the very, very margin, we benefit on the Fed cut rates from a floating rate standpoint. Of course, we're exposed to the steepness of the curve because that plays in the how we reprice maturing fixed rate assets and that's a variable. It's a variable for us. It's variable for everybody. It's one of the reasons we lock some of it in. My own belief in our positioning is such that even though we would expect the Fed to cut here. I think in the end, somewhat sticky inflation, the fact that deficits matter, it's going to cause the curve to steepen out. So we locked some of it in. I don't feel terribly worried about the need to lock the rest of it in. I just think we're in a good place. We're going to do fine.\nBill Carcache: Okay. That's helpful. And then on the asset quality side, Slide 14 shows that steady upward trajectory in NPLs, but the reserve rate is relatively stable to down slightly, as you mentioned. And so, it looks like the loss content that you see in the portfolio is stable. It's certainly not rising despite the rising NPLs. Maybe could you speak a little bit to that? And are there any implications of loan repricing that you are concerned about? For example, would you expect any impact on the credit performance of your customers as their loans begin to reset to higher rates?\nWilliam Demchak: I mean, just quickly, the movement from -- particularly in office CRE, right, from criticized to nonperforming-related reserving and charge-offs is all going as we've expected. That's the natural progression of that cycle, nothing's changed. We're not surprised by anything. We're reserved for it. Credit quality of corporate America as it relates to at what point do the people who have locked in fixed rates and loan rates start to have to pay more. Ultimately, at the margin is going to impact the way we rate somebody. I think about multifamily is an example where higher rates have hurt coverage ratios. It's not going to cause losses, but it's caused us to downgrade that asset class simply because the excess isn't there. I think it will flow through to corporate America over a period of time as well. But I'm not particularly worried about it.\nRobert Reilly: And I'll just add that our reserves are adequate. The increase in the non-CRE NPLs in commercial really was one single large credit that is in our business credit fully secured. So...\nWilliam Demchak: Yes, not in the U.S.\nRobert Reilly: So it doesn't have a lot of loss context.\nBill Carcache: Okay. Understood. Thanks, Bill and Rob. Bill, if I could squeeze in one last one for you. I wanted to get your thoughts on the FedNow Instant Payment Services, which has been getting some attention. Is there a fee opportunity there? I guess, what level of engagement are you seeing from PNC customers? Do you see potential for lower cost instant digital payments disintermediating debit? It'd just be helpful to hear your thoughts on the overall risk versus potential benefits of that to PNC.\nWilliam Demchak: I don't think FedNow has any impact on PNC. To be honest with you, we've been active with real-time payments in the Clearing House and the use cases, all the ones you can think about from insurers who want to pay real-time claims in a disaster through to certain payroll capabilities through to Zelle, for example. And FedNow doesn't add or subtract anything to that opportunity. The challenge you have with real-time payments, both at the Clearing House and FedNow at the Fed is they are not networks, they are a rail to move money. And the distinction between that is a network has very clear rules on who's responsible for items that don't transmit the right way, who's responsible for fraud, who's responsible for returns on and on and on. And neither of those two networks purposely were built -- or sorry, neither of those two payment rails purposely were built to [indiscernible] moving money, which is very different. So I don't think long term, it has much of an impact, to be honest with you.\nBill Carcache: Thank you for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.\nKen Usdin: Hey. Thanks a lot. Good morning. You guys gave us a great table last December with the repricing of fixed assets through 2025. And I'm just wondering, how much carry forward will there also be through 2026? Should we think about that kind of ratably? Obviously, it's been six months since you gave us that slide, but just wondering just how that rolls as we look further ahead. Thanks.\nRobert Reilly: Well, Ken, we're going to refrain from 2026 guidance on the call here today. But it will continue to increase, but the real change in the dynamic occurs obviously in the first and second quarter of 2025 and then grows from there.\nKen Usdin: Okay. Yes. That's why I'm asking the building box question as opposed to NII question.\nRobert Reilly: Sure. Yes. Sure.\nKen Usdin: Okay. Understood. And then on the expenses, so you guys have been doing a great job holding the line. And I just wanted to ask like it looks like there's a pretty decent ramp baked into the second half on expenses. And I'm just wondering like what influences that? Because it seems like expenses will be growing faster than revenues in the second half. So -- or certainly faster than fees. So can you just walk through, is that conservatism? Is there some catch-up on investments that you're making? Any context on that? Thanks, Rob.\nRobert Reilly: Yes, sure, sure. No, we've outperformed on the first half, no doubt about it, and we feel great about that, and that's one of the reasons why we increased our CIP goal and also increased our guidance for the full year expenses. In the third quarter, it doesn't all happen uniformly. In the third quarter, we do have some investments coming online, technology investments coming online that bring some depreciation expense. We've got an additional day, those sorts of things. So it's all part of the plan. It's just expenses don't fall uniformly throughout the year.\nKen Usdin: Okay. Got it. And then, obviously, as that plays forward and if NII is better next year, you can also afford more cost growth, but we'll hear about that later.\nRobert Reilly: Yes. That's right.\nKen Usdin: Got it. Thank you.\nRobert Reilly: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.\nMike Mayo: Hi. Similar to some of the others, maybe this is like the game of jeopardy. I think the answer is, you have continued improvement program with expense savings going from $425 million up to $450 million. You have securities repositioning that's giving you a boost to NII for the rest of this year, and you have fixed asset repricing that helps your securities yield go up by 400 basis points. Your forward payment swaps go up by 180 basis points and a little bit some other things. So the answer is, all those things are going in the right direction, yet you still have a guide for negative operating leverage for this year. I guess, what is the question? Or why is that? Or you can't eke it out or...\nRobert Reilly: Well, sure. So now the question...\nMike Mayo: And why should -- yes. Go ahead.\nRobert Reilly: Yes. So just to keep with your jeopardy approach there, the question would be what loan growth going to be in the second half. So it did come down.\nMike Mayo: Okay. That's helpful. So -- yeah, so what's -- Bill, you were very adamant three quarters ago about loan growth. And look, if you get NII in your range even without getting loan growth, I think people would rather take that than not. But we're hearing all the -- the biggest capital market players are just gushing with their expectations that this is a big capital markets recovery, the world's back, everything else. H8 data actually showed a little bit better. I think you might have underperformed the H8 data this quarter on loan growth. So is it, A, that you're just being more prudent and conservative and you're not seeing the pricing that you want; or B, your mix is just a little bit differently; or C, maybe your team is not executing quite as well as you'd like them to do?\nWilliam Demchak: I think you're trying to read into this too hard. Look, we're basically on H8, maybe a little soft on consumer because our card book didn't grow. When C&I comes back, traditionally, we'll do better. We've been actually adding DHE. They're just not drawing and we're winning clients. All we did, Mike, was this whole notion of if we're giving guidance on the expectation and some crystal ball that says there's going to be loan growth when thus far, we don't see evidence of it, we just took it out. If it shows up, then it's additive to everything we do. And we certainly aren't underperforming. We're winning clients at a pace that we never have. So it's literally this notion of when do they draw on lines and we just put -- we got tired of talking about it. When they do it, we'll benefit, and it will add to all of those numbers that you're looking at.\nMike Mayo: And any meat on those bones about customer acquisition? You did mention 51% loan utilization. That seems a pretty low level versus 53% a year ago and 55% historical. So I guess, that would back up what you're saying, but how much are you growing loans? You expanded to so many MSAs and implemented teams and did all that stuff that helps sometimes and other times it doesn't help as much.\nWilliam Demchak: Yes, I don't -- Rob, do you know DHE number?\nRobert Reilly: I don't know off the top of my head.\nWilliam Demchak: We've grown exposures, and we've won clients at a pace well beyond, particularly in the new markets, but overall, well beyond what we've managed to do historically. We ought to and we will produce some of those metrics for you.\nRobert Reilly: Yes. No, that's all good. And just to add to that, Mike, CapEx sales, as we said in our opening comments, CapEx sales ratios are low, inventory levels are low. So there's just -- there's a lot of pointing to loan growth. It's just we don't control it.\nMike Mayo: And just last follow-up on that because, Bill, you've been around for a while and Rob, the disconnect between what we're hearing and seeing in the capital markets and that activity picking up versus the still subdued loan growth as you say, CapEx and inventory are lower. It just seems CEO confidence is up, people ready to do all sorts of things, yet when the rubber meets the road with you guys, you're just not seeing it that much.\nWilliam Demchak: You're trying to isolate us, and we're not isolated. I would happily tell you loan growth is going to be 2%, which is what all our peers are going to say. And if they hit 2% -- if we hit 2% -- sorry, if they hit 2%, then we'll hit 2%.\nRobert Reilly: Or maybe a little better.\nWilliam Demchak: Yes. It's I just -- I don't see anything suggesting that's going to happen. So maybe -- I mean, what would you rather have us do here put in our forecast a -- we hope this happens number or just give you numbers that we know are going to happen.\nMike Mayo: No, I understand. Underpromise, never deliver, it's what you try to do. It's just -- in the past, you said at this stage of the cycle, and historically, you've seen loan growth come back. So it sounds like this cycle might be -- it might be a little bit different, it might not be.\nWilliam Demchak: Yes. I think I've spent a lot of time pondering this, Mike. I don't -- look, at the margin, it's going to be that the cost of holding inventory, right? Just the cost of that drawn revolver is big time on the radar of corporates who are managing their own profitability. If you can run the lower inventory, your interest rates go way down when Fed funds is 5.25%. So I think that's part of it. And I think this whole uncertainty as we come up into the election on what's it going to look like from a regulatory basis, what am I allowed to invest in, am I going to get it approved? All of that, there's a lot of pent-up energy behind that, and we'll see. But I don't know. And it literally was this thing of rather than keep guessing and wishing, if it happens, it's a great outcome. But we don't need to rely on it.\nMike Mayo: Got it. Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.\nMatt O'Connor: Good morning. Bill, I haven't heard you guys talk too much about credit card. You mentioned a new product and some more coming, and just thoughts on kind of the strategy for card going forward, and the targeted customer, and then any interest in acquiring portfolios, which has not really been the radar in the past. Thanks.\nWilliam Demchak: Yes, we're not going to acquire portfolios. The product that we have historically offered our existing clients and the service levels, websites, processing that went along with it were less than what we aspire to. We have an ability to get higher penetration with our existing clients, offer them better products, have better technology. Historically, we prioritized tech investments inside of our core retail space. So think online, mobile, real time. And we just haven't put the same energy, although about a year ago we started to, into what we do in credit card. Some of that is service technology, ease for customers, application, all of that stuff. Some of it is just getting better at approvals. And we're not going to change our credit box, but we're missing a lot of clients who are in that credit box, because we make it too hard for them.\nRobert Reilly: Yes, in simple terms, we're just under-penetrated relative to industry averages. Nothing hugely aspirational other than just to have our fair share.\nMatt O'Connor: Yes, that makes sense. And then just separately, I think you still have half of your original Visa stake. And what's kind of the plan on that? And I assume that's in the $750 million range, mark to market for Visa, net of hedges and stuff like that. But just frame what's left and the timing of it? Thanks.\nWilliam Demchak: I'm sorry, I missed the front part of that question.\nMatt O'Connor: Oh, just the remaining Visa [Multiple Speakers]\nWilliam Demchak: What happens with the back half? So the 50% that we did not have the ability to monetize. Well, Visa controls that schedule. Some of it's reliant on the litigation resolution and some of it's reliant on the schedule they've laid out, which is sort of a multi-year exchange. So we'll just continue to monitor it.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\nGerard Cassidy: Hi, Bill. Hi, Rob.\nWilliam Demchak: Hey, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: You guys have a good fortune of having insights into the commercial real estate business through [Midland] (ph), your CNBS servicer. Can you give us some insights and color on what Midland is seeing in terms of their pipeline of increased special servicing, which of course I know has higher revenue, but more importantly, maybe directionally, shows us where accredited is heading.\nRobert Reilly: Yeah, that's a good question, Gerard. Ironically, their special servicing balance has actually went down in the quarter, which is a little bit of a head scratcher. We don't think that's necessarily indicative of a trend. We do expect it to continue to go up. But from the start, and I think you've asked this question before, it's been much, much slower in terms of those increases, those balances than you would have expected.\nWilliam Demchak: Yeah. I went through forecasts on sort of expectations on maturity bubbles and property types. We don't expect that balance -- it's not going to grow at the pace that intuitively you might have thought of.\nRobert Reilly: Yes, and that we thought a year ago.\nWilliam Demchak: Yeah, because things are getting cured, they're getting sold off pretty quickly. There's -- for things that are really bad, there's still a lot of capital in the market. So they're turning it faster than perhaps we would have thought.\nGerard Cassidy: Are they seeing any change in the product? Is it still primarily commercial office, or is it moving into any of the product areas?\nWilliam Demchak: It's mostly office.\nGerard Cassidy: Got it. Okay.\nWilliam Demchak: It's interesting. It's all of the above for all of the historical reasons. So there's still a little retail, there's hotels that will show up in there, there's multi-family that is in the multi-family that went to Freddie Fannie and then increasingly its office and the bubble down the road looks more like office.\nGerard Cassidy: Got it. And then just on your commercial real estate in the Slide 15, you give us obviously good detail and you've always told us about this multi-tenant office is the issue. It looks like obviously with 52% criticized, how far are you along in analyzing or reviewing that portfolio? Are you completely through it and now it's going a second time? Or any color there?\nWilliam Demchak: I mean, we are \u2013\nRobert Reilly: Oh, we've analyzed.\nWilliam Demchak: I mean, we're completely through it every quarter. I mean, a couple of things. I don't know we put this out there, but there's actually not that many loans. So we don't have thousands of small loans. These are typically larger loans. And so, we've gone asset by asset. And as anything gets close to being troubled, we look at two different appraisals, one of which is our own self-generated, using more extreme negative assumptions than what you might get from a commercial appraiser. We use higher vacancy rates, higher interest rates, longer time to lease up, higher cost to rehab, all that other stuff in our evaluation. So we go through this. We know all the properties. We keep looking at them. We know what's going to happen to them. We know the timelines. Look, it's not a great outcome, but there's nothing in there that I think is going to surprise us.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And just one last one on this, Bill. Geographically, are you guys finding certain parts of the country weaker than others? I know there's a lot of talk about the big urban markets, Class B and C buildings. How about from your vantage point, what are you guys saying geographically?\nWilliam Demchak: It's not -- it's property by property, right? You could be in a lousy city, but be in the right place and do fine. So, I just don't know that it matters.\nGerard Cassidy: Got it. Okay.\nRobert Reilly: That relates to our portfolio for sure.\nGerard Cassidy: Yes. Got it. Okay. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Bryan Gill for closing comments.\nBryan Gill: Well, thank you all for joining our call this morning. And if you have any follow-up calls, feel free to reach out to the IR team, and we'd be happy to jump on a call with you.\nWilliam Demchak: Thanks everybody.\nRobert Reilly: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "William Demchak",
            "content": "Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we had a strong second quarter, and we generated $1.5 billion in net income, or $3.39 diluted earnings per share. Our results included a gain on a portion of our Visa Class B shares, which was substantially offset by other items in the quarter, including a securities repositioning. Rob is going to provide more details on that Visa gain financial results and outlook in a second, but I'll highlight a few items. First off, net interest income has moved past its trough, and both NII and NIM grew in the quarter. And by the way, this would have occurred independent of the $10 million impact that we got from the securities repositioning. Importantly, we are on a growth trajectory towards expected record NII in 2025. We continue to add new customers and see strong business momentum across our franchise, particularly in the new and expansion markets. [DDA] (ph) growth accelerated in our branches and we continue to add new corporate and commercial banking clients above historical rates. In our retail business, we launched our first new credit card in several years, PNC Cash Unlimited, a highly competitive card that offers 2% back on all purchases. We plan to launch several new cards in the months and year ahead. Average deposits held relatively flat to the first quarter levels, a little bit ahead of our expectations. And our expenses remained well controlled and we generated positive operating leverage during the second quarter. Rob is going to touch on this in a minute, but we have increased our continuous improvement program target for 2024 as expense discipline remains a top priority. The credit environment continues to play out as we have expected, including an increase in charge-offs within the CRE office portfolio, where we remain adequately reserved. Outside of CRE office, credit quality remains relatively stable. Finally, we further strengthen our capital levels during the quarter. Our strong balance sheet allows us to continue supporting our customers and communities, investing in our business and people, and delivering returns for shareholders. Our financial strength and stability are also reflected in the latest results from the Fed stress test in which we maintained our stress capital buffer at the regulatory minimum of 2.5% and importantly for the second year in a row, PNC has had the lowest start to trough capital depletion in our peer group, further demonstrating our best-in-class resiliency. With this in mind, our board recently approved an increase in our quarterly stock dividend by $0.05. In summary, we delivered strong results in the second quarter and are well positioned to drive further growth and expansion into 2025 and beyond. Before I turn it over to Rob, as always, I just want to thank our employees for everything they do for our company and our customers. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob to take you through the quarter. Rob? Hey, good morning, Betsy. You should think of it as a one-off. I mean, you never say never and I don't know what the future holds, but practically at this point, we don't have to do any restructuring on anything to hit that stated goal of the 2025 record NII. Yes. Sure, Betsy. I would say the short answer to that is, stable to down is our expectation with an emphasis on stable. Things have really stabilized year-over-year as you know. So our expectation is, some downward drift but not anywhere near the level that we've seen in the last couple of years. Sure. Hi, John. Well, I could [Multiple Speakers] I think that's an important point. That's the big difference in this quarter. We changed our guidance for average loans to be up 1% or approximately 1% for the year, John. As you can see now, down less than 1%. We don't control that. There's a basis for some loan growth in the second half of the year. But the important point is, we've taken it out of our guidance and our NII improved to the better end of the previous guidance, not just due to the securities restructuring, but also the positive deposit dynamics and so forth. Yes, I think, John, just on buybacks, I mean, at some point, I got to believe loan growth comes back. But to the extent it doesn't, we're generating a lot of capital, obviously, in excess of our dividend. And we'll face that question. If we're not using that capital for loan growth, should we accelerate deployment and buybacks? We're not there yet, but that happens down the road if loan growth doesn't materialize because we're generating a lot of capital. Good morning. That's a good question. Probably 50 basis points ago. One of the issues, of course, when everybody talks about fixed rate asset repricing is, what is it repriced to? And of course, therefore, we are exposed to whatever that five-year rate is, a year and two out. And those forward starting swaps simply with a very opportunistic point locked in materially higher rates than where we are today. To Rob's point, that just locks in the certainty of what we'll be able to produce on a go-forward basis. Yes, I mean, basically we want to have our fair share of consumer lending products with the clients we serve in our traditional DDA and other products. And we don't today. We're there on home equity. We're probably close in mortgage. We're under-prevented in auto and in card and in card in particular, we just haven't had good offerings. We've had stale technology, we've had slow -- we need to improve and it's an opportunity for us. Good morning. Yes. So, when we take a look at our total reserves and our total portfolio, CRE office aside, things are pretty stable. Maybe on quarter-to-quarter basis, consumers are a little bit better, commercial non-CRE is a little bit worse, but not bad. So, definitely some more movements, some downgrades reflecting the higher rates, slower economic activity in our commercial book, but no patterns or any themes to point out. Reserves are stable, yes. Sure. Sure. We are largely indifferent. I mean, at the very, very margin, we benefit on the Fed cut rates from a floating rate standpoint. Of course, we're exposed to the steepness of the curve because that plays in the how we reprice maturing fixed rate assets and that's a variable. It's a variable for us. It's variable for everybody. It's one of the reasons we lock some of it in. My own belief in our positioning is such that even though we would expect the Fed to cut here. I think in the end, somewhat sticky inflation, the fact that deficits matter, it's going to cause the curve to steepen out. So we locked some of it in. I don't feel terribly worried about the need to lock the rest of it in. I just think we're in a good place. We're going to do fine. I mean, just quickly, the movement from -- particularly in office CRE, right, from criticized to nonperforming-related reserving and charge-offs is all going as we've expected. That's the natural progression of that cycle, nothing's changed. We're not surprised by anything. We're reserved for it. Credit quality of corporate America as it relates to at what point do the people who have locked in fixed rates and loan rates start to have to pay more. Ultimately, at the margin is going to impact the way we rate somebody. I think about multifamily is an example where higher rates have hurt coverage ratios. It's not going to cause losses, but it's caused us to downgrade that asset class simply because the excess isn't there. I think it will flow through to corporate America over a period of time as well. But I'm not particularly worried about it. Yes, not in the U.S. I don't think FedNow has any impact on PNC. To be honest with you, we've been active with real-time payments in the Clearing House and the use cases, all the ones you can think about from insurers who want to pay real-time claims in a disaster through to certain payroll capabilities through to Zelle, for example. And FedNow doesn't add or subtract anything to that opportunity. The challenge you have with real-time payments, both at the Clearing House and FedNow at the Fed is they are not networks, they are a rail to move money. And the distinction between that is a network has very clear rules on who's responsible for items that don't transmit the right way, who's responsible for fraud, who's responsible for returns on and on and on. And neither of those two networks purposely were built -- or sorry, neither of those two payment rails purposely were built to [indiscernible] moving money, which is very different. So I don't think long term, it has much of an impact, to be honest with you. I think you're trying to read into this too hard. Look, we're basically on H8, maybe a little soft on consumer because our card book didn't grow. When C&I comes back, traditionally, we'll do better. We've been actually adding DHE. They're just not drawing and we're winning clients. All we did, Mike, was this whole notion of if we're giving guidance on the expectation and some crystal ball that says there's going to be loan growth when thus far, we don't see evidence of it, we just took it out. If it shows up, then it's additive to everything we do. And we certainly aren't underperforming. We're winning clients at a pace that we never have. So it's literally this notion of when do they draw on lines and we just put -- we got tired of talking about it. When they do it, we'll benefit, and it will add to all of those numbers that you're looking at. Yes, I don't -- Rob, do you know DHE number? We've grown exposures, and we've won clients at a pace well beyond, particularly in the new markets, but overall, well beyond what we've managed to do historically. We ought to and we will produce some of those metrics for you. You're trying to isolate us, and we're not isolated. I would happily tell you loan growth is going to be 2%, which is what all our peers are going to say. And if they hit 2% -- if we hit 2% -- sorry, if they hit 2%, then we'll hit 2%. Yes. It's I just -- I don't see anything suggesting that's going to happen. So maybe -- I mean, what would you rather have us do here put in our forecast a -- we hope this happens number or just give you numbers that we know are going to happen. Yes. I think I've spent a lot of time pondering this, Mike. I don't -- look, at the margin, it's going to be that the cost of holding inventory, right? Just the cost of that drawn revolver is big time on the radar of corporates who are managing their own profitability. If you can run the lower inventory, your interest rates go way down when Fed funds is 5.25%. So I think that's part of it. And I think this whole uncertainty as we come up into the election on what's it going to look like from a regulatory basis, what am I allowed to invest in, am I going to get it approved? All of that, there's a lot of pent-up energy behind that, and we'll see. But I don't know.

            "name": "Robert Reilly",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average linked quarter basis. Loans of $320 billion were stable. Investment securities increased $6 billion or 4%. And our cash balances at the Federal Reserve were $41 billion, a decrease of $7 billion or 15%, primarily reflecting the deployment of cash into higher-yielding securities. Deposit balances averaged $417 billion, a decline of $3 billion or less than 1% due to a seasonal decline in corporate balances. Borrowed funds increased $2 billion or 2% and were 15% of total liabilities. At quarter end, AOCI was negative $7.4 billion and improved $600 million compared with March 31st. Our tangible book value increased $89.12 per common share, a 4% increased linked quarter, and a 15% increase compared to the same period a year ago. We remain well capitalized and our estimated CET1 ratio increased to 10.2% as of June 30th. Regarding the Basel III end-game, we expect the inclusion of AOCI in the final rule and our CET1 ratio with the impact of AOCI would be 8.7%. And while we recognize the likelihood of changes to certain other aspects of the Basel III end-game NPR, under the currently proposed capital rules, our estimated fully phased-in expanded risk-based CET1 ratio would be approximately 8.4%. We continue to be well positioned with capital flexibility. We returned roughly $700 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter, which included $600 million in common dividends and $100 million of share repurchases. And as Bill just mentioned, our board recently approved a $0.05 increase to our quarterly cash dividend on common stock, raising the dividend to $1.60 per share. Our recent CCAR results underscores the strength of our balance sheet and as previously announced our current stress capital buffer remains at the regulatory minimum of 2.5% for the four quarter period beginning in October 2024. Slide 5 shows our loans in more detail. Compared to the first quarter, average loan balances were stable. Commercial loans were essentially flat as utilization remains well below both the pre-pandemic historical average of roughly 55% and the second quarter 2023 level of 52.5%. Importantly, we continue to grow customer relationships and CNIB loan commitments increase during the second quarter. Although the direction of the near-term economy remains uncertain, CapEx to sales levels and inventory growth rates remain below historical averages, both of which are typically leading indicators of eventual commercial loan growth. Average consumer loans declined approximately $600 million or less than 1%, driven by lower residential real estate and home equity loan balances. And the yield on total loans increased 4 basis points to 6.05% in the second quarter. Slide 6 details our investment security and swap portfolios. Average investment securities of $141 billion increased $6 billion, or 4%, reflecting the deployment of excess liquidity into higher-yielding securities, primarily U.S. treasuries. The securities portfolio yield increased 22 basis points to 2.84%, driven by higher rates on new purchases. As of June 30th, the securities portfolio duration was 3.5 years. During the second quarter, our forward starting swaps increased to $18 billion. With the addition of these swaps, we've locked in a portion of our fixed rate asset repricing through 2025 at a level that is approximately 300 basis points higher than maturity. The total weighted average received fixed rate of our swap portfolio, including the forward starters, increased 83 basis points to 3.13% and the duration of the portfolio is 2.2 years. Slide 7 highlights the securities repositioning we executed during the second quarter. We sold securities with a book value of $4.3 billion and a market value of $3.8 billion. We recognized a $497 million loss on the sale and reinvested the $3.8 billion of proceeds into securities, with yields approximately 400 basis points higher than the securities sold. The reposition is expected to benefit our net interest income by $80 million in 2024, with roughly $10 million of that being realized in the second quarter. And the estimated earn-back period for this transaction is less than four years. Turning to Slide 8, we expect considerable runoff of low-yielding securities and swaps through the end of 2026, which will allow us to continue to reinvest into higher-yielding assets, providing a meaningful benefit to net interest income. Accumulated other comprehensive income improved to negative $7.4 billion on June 30th, compared to negative $8 billion on March 31st. The improvement was primarily due to the securities repositioning. AOCI will continue to accrete back as our securities and swaps mature, resulting in further growth to tangible book value. Slide 9 covers our deposits in more detail. Average deposits declined $3 billion or 1% reflecting seasonally lower corporate balances. Regarding mix, consolidated non-interest bearing deposits were 23% of total deposits in the second quarter, down less than 1 percentage point from the first quarter. Additionally, average non-interest bearing deposits had the smallest dollar decline in the second quarter of 2024 since the Fed began raising rates in 2022, which gives us confidence that the non-interest bearing portion of our deposits has largely stabilized. And our rate paid on interest bearing deposits increased by only 1 basis point during the second quarter to 2.61%. We believe our rate paid on deposits is approaching its peak level, but we do expect some potential to [drift] (ph) higher as interest rates remain elevated. Turning to the income statement, and as Bill mentioned, there were several significant items in the quarter, and I want to provide a bit more detail. Taken together, these significant items have a minimal impact to our earnings per share, totaling to a net EPS benefit of $0.09. As we previously disclosed, we participated in the Visa exchange program, allowing us to monetize 50% of our Visa Class B-1 shares and convert our remaining holdings to 1.8 million Visa Class B-2 shares. Through the exchange we recognized a $754 million pre-tax gain. In addition, we had significant items that occurred in the second quarter that largely offset the gain, and they are as follows: First, as I mentioned earlier, we repositioned a portion of our securities portfolio and through the sale of certain low-yielding securities recognized a $497 million loss. Second, we recorded a negative $116 million Visa derivative fair value adjustment associated with Visa Class B-2 shares, primarily related to the extension of anticipated litigation resolution. And lastly, we recognize the $120 million PNC Foundation contribution expense. The foundation supports our communities and early childhood education. Turning to Slide 11, we highlight our income statement trends. Second quarter net income was $1.5 billion or $3.39 per share. Total revenue of $5.4 billion increased $266 million or 5% compared to the first quarter of 2024. Net interest income grew by $38 million, or 1% in the second quarter. Notably, this is the first time NII has increased in six quarters, marking the beginning of an expected upward trajectory. And our net interest margin was 2.6% an increase of 3 basis points. Non-interest income increased $228 million, or 12%, and included $141 million of the significant items I previously detailed. Noninterest expense of $3.4 billion increased $23 million, or 1%, and included the $120 million foundation contribution expense. Notably, we generated positive operating leverage in both the linked quarter and year-over-year comparisons. Provision was $235 million in the second quarter, reflecting portfolio activity, and our effective tax rate was 18.8%. Turning to Slide 12, we highlight our revenue trends. Second quarter revenue was up $266 million or 5%, driven by higher non-interest income and net interest income. Net interest income of $3.3 billion increased $38 million or 1%, driven by higher yields on interest earning assets. Fee income was $1.8 billion and increased $31 million or 2% linked quarter. Looking at the detail, asset management and brokerage and non-interest income was stable late quarter, as the benefit of higher average equity markets was offset by lower annuity sales due to elevated first quarter activity. Capital markets and advisory fees increased $13 million or 5%, driven by higher M&A advisory activity and loan syndications, partially offset by lower underwriting fees. Card and cash management increased $35 million, or 5%, reflecting seasonally higher consumer transaction volumes and higher treasury management fees. Mortgage revenue declined $16 million or 11%, primarily due to lower residential mortgage activity. Other noninterest income of $332 million increased to $197 million and included $141 million related to this quarter's significant items. Turning to Slide 13, our non-interest expense of $3.4 billion was well controlled, increasing by only $23 million or 1%. Expenses for the second quarter included the $120 million contribution to the PNC Foundation, while the first quarter of 2024 included $130 million FDIC special assessment. Importantly, non-interest expense excluding the foundation contribution declined $135 million or 4% compared with the second quarter of 2023. Notably, personnel declined as a result of the workforce reduction actions we took last year. As Bill mentioned, we remain diligent in our continuous improvement efforts. At the beginning of the year, we set a continuous improvement program goal of $425 million. Recently, we have identified initiatives that support increasing our CIP by an additional $25 million, raising our full-year target to $450 million. As you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 14. Non-performing loans increased $123 million or 5% linked quarter, primarily driven by an individual secured loan within our asset-based lending business. Total delinquencies of $1.3 billion were stable with March 31. Net loan charge-offs were $262 million in the second quarter and included $106 million of net charge-offs related to our CRE office portfolio. And our annualized net charge-off to average loans ratio was 33 basis points. Our allowance for credit losses total $5.4 billion, or 1.7% of total loans on June 30th, stable with March 31st. Slide 15 provides more detail on our CRE office credit metrics. CRE office NPLs were stable in the second quarter, as charged off and paydowns offset inflows to non-performing loans. And the migration of criticized loans to non-performing status is an expected outcome as we work to resolve the challenges inherent to this portfolio. As expected, net loan charge-offs within the CRE office portfolio increased and totaled $106 million in the second quarter. Ultimately, we expect additional charge-offs on this portfolio, the size of which will vary quarter-to-quarter given the nature of the loans. As of June 30, our reserves on the office portfolio were 10.3% of total office loans, and inside of that, 15.5% on the multi-tenant portfolio. Accordingly, we believe we are adequately reserved. Importantly, we continue to manage our exposure down, and as a result, our balance has declined 4% or approximately $300 million linked quarter. In summary, PNC posted a solid second quarter 2024 and we're well positioned for the second half of the year. Regarding our view of the overall economy, we're expecting continued economic growth in the second half of the year, resulting in real GDP growth of approximately 2% in 2024, and unemployment to increase modestly to slightly above 4% by year-end. We expect the Fed to cut rates 2 times in 2024, with a 25 basis point decrease in September and another in December. Looking at the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024, we expect average loans to be stable, net interest income to be up 1% to 2%, fee income to be up 1% to 2%, other non-interest income to be in the range of $150 million and $200 million, excluding Visa and securities activity. We expect core non-interest expense to be up 3% to 4%. We expect third quarter net charge-offs to be between $250 million and $300 million. Regarding our full-year guidance, for ease of comparability to prior guidance, we exclude the first quarter FDIC special assessment, as well as the second quarter Visa gain and other significant items. Considering our reported first half operating results, third quarter expectations, and current economic forecasts, our full year 2024 guidance is as follows: For the full year 2024 compared to full year 2023, we expect average loans to be down less than 1%, which equates to nominal loan growth in the second half of 2024. We recognize the potential for greater loan growth, and should that occur, it will be accreted to our full year average. Despite lower expected loan volumes, we expect full year NII to be at the better end of our previous expectations, or down approximately 4%. We expect our securities repositioning and better than expected deposit dynamics to offset the impact of a lower than expected loan volume. We expect non-interest income to be up 3% to 5%, slightly lower than our previous guidance due to continued softness and mortgage activity and to a lesser extent, loan-related capital market fees. As a result, total revenue is expected to be down 1% to 2% and inside the range of our previous guidance. We now expect core non-interest expense to be down approximately 1% versus our previous guidance of stable, in part due to our increased CIP target. And we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18.5%. With that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions. And we don't have any plans to do that. It wasn't -- If you backed out the restructuring, the guide would still be higher. And we did that while muting our loan growth assumption. And we did that because we kind of just got tired of saying that, hey, loan growth is going to come at some point. So we took it out of the forecast. If it shows up, we will benefit like everybody else. Yes. I mean, right now we're on pace and we continue to -- we expect to continue the pace that we've been on for the first couple of quarters. And as you know, the new rules are still in flux, so there's not finalization there. And then beyond that, I think, a driver will be what happens with loan growth, which would be a factor in terms of that being our highest and best use of our capital. But that'll be a factor in terms of deciding on buybacks. But the important part is that we are buying back shares. Yes, sure. Our plan -- so Slide 9 is a good slide and that clearly shows a decline in the increase of the rate paid. The short answer to one of your questions there is, we do expect the rates [indiscernible] drift up a little bit, but in contrast it's more like a handful of basis points versus the contrast to the previous quarters where you see 60 or 50 and even 30 in recent quarters. So it's slowed down considerably. That's our expectation in the short-term, Erika. When we get into rate cuts, we'll see -- we'll be able to move pretty quickly on the high rates paid on commercial and [indiscernible]. But we still do have these interest-bearing consumer deposits that are below market that will grind higher. So that's something that we've talked about before and just something that we'll need to keep our eye on. Well, my answer to that would not necessarily be the magnitude, but the certainty. So essentially what we've done is locked in some of the swoosh. Yes, it's mostly a refinement, Scott. So, for the full year guide around the fees, we lowered our expectations of increase, as you know, from up 4% to 6% to up 3% to 5%. So still up and a small shift. Most of that coming from continued softness in mortgage, which we expect to be on the -- continue in the balance half or second half of the year, a little bit less than what we were expecting. To a lesser extent tied to the reduced loan guidance, we do have loan-related fees within our capital market segment, think loan syndication. So generally speaking, if there's fewer loans, there'll be fewer loan syndication fees. So that's just a direct correlation there to that guide. And again, we could see loan growth, and if that's the case, then those fees would come back. But that's the general thinking, everything else on schedule, so to speak. Sure. So, we don't necessarily provide NIM guidance, because it's more an outcome than anything. But to answer your question, we've operated in, call it a normal environment at a 3% NIM margin. So if we definitely expect to go up into 2025, if we approach those levels, it won't be like we haven't been there before. So it's reasonable. And I'll just add that our reserves are adequate. The increase in the non-CRE NPLs in commercial really was one single large credit that is in our business credit fully secured. So... So it doesn't have a lot of loss context. Well, Ken, we're going to refrain from 2026 guidance on the call here today. But it will continue to increase, but the real change in the dynamic occurs obviously in the first and second quarter of 2025 and then grows from there. Sure. Yes. Sure. Yes, sure, sure. No, we've outperformed on the first half, no doubt about it, and we feel great about that, and that's one of the reasons why we increased our CIP goal and also increased our guidance for the full year expenses. In the third quarter, it doesn't all happen uniformly. In the third quarter, we do have some investments coming online, technology investments coming online that bring some depreciation expense. We've got an additional day, those sorts of things. So it's all part of the plan. It's just expenses don't fall uniformly throughout the year. Yes. That's right. Sure. Well, sure. So now the question... Yes. So just to keep with your jeopardy approach there, the question would be what loan growth going to be in the second half. So it did come down. I don't know off the top of my head. Yes. No, that's all good. And just to add to that, Mike, CapEx sales, as we said in our opening comments, CapEx sales ratios are low, inventory levels are low. So there's just -- there's a lot of pointing to loan growth. It's just we don't control it. Or maybe a little better. Yes, in simple terms, we're just under-penetrated relative to industry averages. Nothing hugely aspirational other than just to have our fair share. Yeah, that's a good question, Gerard. Ironically, their special servicing balance has actually went down in the quarter, which is a little bit of a head scratcher. We don't think that's necessarily indicative of a trend. We do expect it to continue to go up. But from the start, and I think you've asked this question before, it's been much, much slower in terms of those increases, those balances than you would have expected. Yes, and that we thought a year ago. Oh, we've analyzed. That relates to our portfolio for sure. Thank you."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Bryan Gill. Thank you, Brian. You may begin.\nBryan Gill: Well, good morning, and welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. I am Bryan Gill, the Director of Investor Relations for PNC, and participating on this call are PNC's Chairman and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's presentation contains forward-looking information, cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com under invest relations. These statements speak only as of April 16, 2024, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\nWilliam Demchak: Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we executed well and delivered solid financial results. We generated $1.3 billion in net income, and adjusting for the FDIC special assessment $3.36 per share. Rob will provide details on our results in a moment, but I'll start with a few thoughts. First, we continue to grow our business. In the first quarter, we added new customers across our segments and increased deposits on a spot basis. We're continuing to invest heavily in our franchise to drive growth and gain share, particularly in our retail banking technology platform or payments businesses and our expansion markets. To that end, in the first quarter, we announced a multiyear investment of nearly $1 billion in our branch network to renovate more than 1,200 locations and open new branches in key locations, including Austin, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Miami and San Antonio. Second, expenses were well managed during the quarter. As we've indicated, expense discipline remains a top priority, and we are on track to maintain stable core expenses in 2024. Third, credit quality remains stable during the quarter. The office portfolio remains an area of focus, but we are adequately reserved overall, and particularly with respect to CRE. We believe our thoughtful approach to managing risk, customer selection and long-term relationship development will continue to serve us well. And fourth, we continue to build on our strong liquidity and capital position during the quarter, providing us with a financial strength and flexibility to help us support our clients grow our businesses and capitalize on future opportunities. In summary, we delivered solid results during the first quarter and positioned ourselves well for the balance of 2024 and beyond. Last month, we launched a brand campaign celebrating our boring approach to banking. Now obviously, we're using humor in the campaign to have a little fun and grab the public's attention. But inside of that humor is honesty about who we are, how we think about risk, and how we run our company. In short, it is everything we do to be steady and predictable. Finally, I just want to thank our employees for everything they do for our customers, for each other, and for all of our stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to rob to take you through the quarter. Rob?\nRobert Reilly: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average linked quarter basis. Loans are $321 billion decreased $4 billion or 1%. Investment securities declined $2 billion or 1%. And our cash balances at the Federal Reserve were $48 billion, an increase of $6 billion or 13%. On a spot basis, our cash at the Fed was $53 billion, up from $43 billion in the prior quarter, reflecting higher period end deposits. Deposit balances averaged $420 billion, a decline of $4 billion or 1%, reflecting seasonally lower commercial deposits. However, on a spot basis, deposits were up $4 billion, reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer deposits. Borrowed funds increased $3 billion to $76 billion, primarily driven by parent company debt issuances early in the quarter. At quarter end, AOCI was a negative $8 billion compared to a negative $7.7 billion at December 31, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates. Our tangible book value increased to $85.70 per common share, an 11% increase compared to the same period a year ago. We remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 10.1% as of March 31. While we recognize the likelihood of potentially substantial changes to the Basel III endgame NPR under the currently proposed capital rules, our estimated fully phased in expanded risk-based CET1 ratio would be approximately 8.3% as of March 31, 2024. We continue to be well positioned with capital flexibility. Share repurchases approximated $135 million or roughly 1 million shares. And when combined with $624 million of common dividends, we returned $759 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter. Slide 5 shows our loans in more detail. Compared to the fourth quarter, average loan balances decreased 1%, primarily driven by lower commercial loan balances. Commercial loans were $219 billion, a decrease of $3.4 billion, driven by lower utilization as well as soft loan demand. Within the corporate and institutional bank, utilization rates have remained below 2023 year-end levels and have not increased in the first quarter as is historically typical. We expect utilization to increase throughout the year. Notably, each percent of utilization within CNIB equates to $4 billion of loan growth. Consumer loans declined approximately $600 million, driven by lower credit card and home equity balances, and total loan yields increased 7 basis points to 6.01% in the first quarter. Slide 6 details our investment, security and swap portfolios. Average investment securities of $135 billion decreased 1% as curtailed purchase activity was more than offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities. The securities portfolio yield increased 3 basis points to 2.62%, reflecting the run-off of lower yielding securities. As of March 31, the securities portfolio duration was four years. Our receive fixed swaps pointed to the commercial loan book totaled $37 billion on March 31. The weighted average receive fixed rate of our swap portfolio increased 20 basis points to 2.3% and the duration of the portfolio was two years. Through the end of 2024, 13% of our securities and swap portfolio is scheduled to mature, which will allow us to reinvest into higher yielding assets, providing a meaningful benefit to net interest income in the second half of the year. Accumulated other comprehensive income was negative $8 billion at March 31, which will accrete back as our securities and swaps mature, resulting in continued tangible book value growth. Slide 7 covers our deposits in more detail. Average deposits decreased $4 billion to $420 billion during the quarter, as growth in consumer deposits was more than offset by a seasonal decline in commercial deposits. Regarding mix, consolidated, non-interest-bearing deposits were 24% in the first quarter, down slightly from 25% in the fourth quarter. Notably, on a spot basis in the first quarter, non-interest-bearing deposits had the smallest dollar decline since the Fed began raising rates in 2022, which gives us confidence that the non-interest-bearing portion of our deposits has largely stabilized. Our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 2.6% during the first quarter, up from 2.48% in the prior quarter. And as of March 31, our cumulative deposit beta was 45% and consistent with our expectations. We believe our deposit betas have approached their peak levels, although, we do expect some potential drift higher through the period leading up to a Fed rate cut, which we currently expect to occur in July. In regard to the timing and amount of potential rate cuts, we recognize there's a lot of fluidity and uncertainty. However, our 2024 NII will largely be unaffected by any short-term interest rate movement or lack thereof. This is because our floating rate assets are aligned with our floating rate liabilities, including our high beta commercial interest-bearing deposits and our long-term debt, which is almost entirely swapped to floating rates. Importantly, going forward, we've remained well positioned for the NII benefit of repricing low yielding fixed rate securities and loans maturing during the latter half of 2024 and into 2025. Turning to the income statement on Slide 8. First quarter net income was $1.3 billion or $3.10 per share, which included a pretax, non-core, non-interest expense of $130 million or $103 million after tax related to the increased FDIC special assess assessment. Excluding non-core expenses, adjusted EPS was $3.36 per share. Total revenue of $5.1 billion decreased $216 million or 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Net interest income declined by $139 million or 4%, and our net interest margin was 2.57%, a decline of 9 basis points, resulting primarily from higher funding costs. Non-interest income decreased $77 million or 4%. Non-interest expense of $3.3 billion declined $740 million or 18%, and included $130 million FDIC special assessment. Importantly, core non-interest expense was $3.2 billion and decreased $205 million or 6%. Provision was $155 million in the first quarter, reflecting portfolio activity and improved macroeconomic factors, and our effective tax rate was 18.8%. Turning to Slide 9. We highlight our revenue trends. First quarter revenue was down $216 million or 4%, driven by lower net interest income and in part a seasonal decline in fee income. Net interest income of $3.3 billion declined $139 million or 4%, reflecting increased funding costs, lower loan balances, and one less day in the quarter. Fee income was $1.7 billion and decreased $74 million or 4% linked quarter. Looking at the detail. Asset management and brokerage revenue was up $4 million or 1%, reflecting higher average equity markets. Capital markets and advisory fees declined $50 million or 16%, driven by lower M&A advisory activity, off elevated fourth quarter levels, partially offset by higher underwriting fees. Card and cash management decreased $17 million or 2%, driven by seasonally lower consumer transaction volumes, partially offset by higher treasury management fees. Lending and deposit related fees declined $9 million or 3%, reflecting the reduction of customer fees on certain checking products. Residential and commercial mortgage revenue declined $2 million or 1%, and included lower residential mortgage activity. Other non-interest income of $135 million decreased $3 million or 2%, reflecting lower gains on sales. The first quarter also included a negative $7 million Visa fair value adjustment compared to a negative $100 million adjustment in the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 10. Our core non-interest expense at $3.2 billion decreased $205 million or 6% linked quarter, reflecting strong expense management. Importantly, compared to the first quarter of 2023, core non-interest expense declined $117 million or 4%, with a decline in every expense category. This broad-based result reflects the impact of expense actions taken in 2023. As we've previously stated, we implemented expense management actions that will drive $750 million of cost savings in 2024. These actions include the $325 million workforce reduction effort last year, which was realized in our first quarter expense run rate, and our $425 million 2024 continuous improvement program goal, which we're well on track to achieve. We remain diligent in our expense management efforts, and these actions give us confidence that will keep our year-over-year expenses stable. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 11. While overall credit quality remains resilient, the pressure we anticipated within the commercial real estate office sector has continued. Non-performing loans increased $200 million or 9% linked quarter, almost entirely driven by commercial real estate, which increased $188 million. And inside of that, approximately $150 million was related to the CRE office portfolio. Total delinquencies of $1.3 billion decreased $109 million or 8% linked quarter, driven by lower consumer and commercial delinquencies. Net loan charge-offs were $243 million in the first quarter, and our annualized net charge-offs to average loans ratio was 30 basis points. Our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.4 billion or 1.7% of total loans on March 31, stable with December 31. Slide 12 provides more detail on our CRE office credit metrics. While NPLs have increased over the past few quarters, our criticized balances have remained relatively consistent. The migration of criticized loans to non-performing status is an expected outcome as we work to resolve the occupancy and rate challenges inherent to this portfolio. In the first quarter, net loan charge-offs within the CRE office portfolio were $50 million, essentially in line with the previous quarter level. Ultimately, we expect continued charge-offs on this portfolio, and accordingly we believe we are adequately reserved. As of March 31, our reserves on the office portfolio were 9.7% of total office loans and inside of that, 14.4% on the multitenant portfolio. Importantly, we continue to manage our exposure down and as a result, our balances declined 3%, or approximately $200 million linked quarter. In summary, PNC reported a solid first quarter 2024, and we're well positioned for the remainder of the year. Regarding our view of the overall economy, we're expecting economic expansion in the second half of the year, resulting in real GDP growth of approximately 2% in 2024, and unemployment to increase modestly to 4% by year end. We expect the Fed to cut rates 2 times in 2024, with a 25 basis point decrease in July and another in November. Looking at the second quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2024, we expect average loans to be stable, net interest income to be down approximately 1%. And as I mentioned previously, we expect NII and net interest margin to trough in the second quarter. Fee income to be up 1% to 2%. Other non-interest income to be in the range of $150 million and $200 million, excluding Visa activity. Taking the component pieces of revenue together, we expect total revenue to be stable. We expect total core non-interest expense to be up 2% to 4%. We expect second quarter net charge-offs to be between $225 million and $275 million. As a reminder, PNC owns 3.5 million Visa class B shares with an unrecognized gain of approximately $1.6 billion. Under the terms of Visa's current exchange program scheduled to close on or about May 3, Class B shareholders will have the opportunity to monetize 50% of their holdings. We've not included the impact of monetizing the Visa gain in our forecast. Turning to Slide 14. Our full year 2024 guidance is unchanged from our January earnings call. And as a reminder, for the full year 2024 compared to the full year 2023, we expect average loan growth of approximately 1%. Total revenue to be stable to down 2%. Inside of that, our expectation is for net interest income to be down in the range of 4% to 5%, and non-interest income to be up 4% to 6%. Core non-interest expense, which excludes the FDIC assessment, is expected to be stable and we expect our affected tax rate to be approximately 18.5%. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Good morning.\nWilliam Demchak: Good morning.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Just want to make sure you can hear me okay.\nWilliam Demchak: Sure.\nBetsy Graseck: Yeah. No. This is great. The first question I have just has to deal (ph) with how you're thinking about the NII indicating, 2Q the trough improving from there. And I would think that the majority of that improvement is coming from loan growth. But correct me If I'm wrong, how you're thinking about that NII trajectory into second half of the year? And then, well, I'll start there.\nRobert Reilly: Okay. Yeah. Good morning, Betsy. This is Rob. So in terms of NII and the trajectory that we're on, we knew at the beginning of the year that we would trough around this time in the second quarter and that's what's happening. We expect to grow from that trough level based on the repricing of our fixed rate assets as rates settle down. There is some reliance on the back half for loan growth, but all consistent with our full year guidance. Average loans up 1%.\nBetsy Graseck: And just on that loan growth fees. You go ahead, sir.\nWilliam Demchak: I was just going to say that the largest driver is repricing of fixed rate assets. We expect some loan growth, but it's not a heroic number in there. It's simply to roll down of our securities book.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Got it. Yeah. All right. And on the loan side, it is interesting to see the utilization rates ticking down here. Do you think that's just a function of Fed funds is 5.5 and that's the base rate from which C&I is priced off of, or is there other dynamics there besides just rate?\nWilliam Demchak: It's a variety of things. I think the capital markets activity in the first quarter in investment-grade debt put a lot of cash into the system and you just -- you saw companies that could hit that market, pay down revolver. So that was sort of a near term impact to it. There's -- as when we look out, there hasn't been any real inventory build, which I would expect given retail sales. There hasn't been much CapEx and capacity utilization has been holding constant at a pretty high level. So, at some point this needs to turn, but I think the first quarter kind of surprised us. And my best guess was that was on the back of just how liquid the public markets were.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Got it. Thanks so much. Really appreciate it, Bill.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning.\nWilliam Demchak: Hey. John.\nJohn Pancari: On the expense front, it looks like within expenses they came in a bit better than expected, maybe on the comp side and certain other areas and you cited the solid expense management and your cost save effort. Is there -- did you say that the trends are coming in perhaps a bit better than you had forecasted as you look at your expense phase, and is there any thought process that potentially your full year '24 outlook could prove conservative in terms of your stable expectation?\nRobert Reilly: John, this is Rob. So I'd say, for the full year, we're still planning and guiding towards stable. In the first quarter, you're right, we're off to a good start, in terms of realizing the expense actions that we took last year and CIP program that we have this year. But it's a little early in the year to roll that all forward. And like I said, we're off to a good start and we're well positioned for stable.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. Thanks, Rob. That's helpful. And then just separately on the credit side, you can see the commercial real estate stress that you mentioned and you prudently added to the office reserve in the quarter, but relatively stable or down a little bit in terms of your firm wide reserve. Are you seeing -- could you maybe talk about the progression in credit in other areas? Do you see maybe mounting stress at all in C&I that could keep you -- potentially keep the reserve currently stable, or could you continue to, from a firm y perspective bleed the reserve here?\nWilliam Demchak: Bleed is a bad word. The credit action at the moment is in the real estate book and specifically inside of office, consumer at the margin a little bit worse, but there isn't anything systematic going on in C&I that would cause us to have any different expectations of what we see now, and we're reserved for the moment based on our economic forecast.\nRobert Reilly: Yeah. The pressure is in the CRE book, specifically the office book.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. And then just related to that, are you seeing migration in the office book that is surprising, given your forecast on the added, notably to the office reserve, is there anything there that surprised you in terms of your reappraisals or your work on that front?\nRobert Reilly: No surprises. Yeah. Everything's progressing as we expected. We started with the criticized, the NPLs are up a little bit, but everything is consistent with what we've been saying.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. All right. Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.\nMatt O'Connor: Good morning. Looking at Slide 6 here, where you show the runoff of the fixed rate securities and swaps. And any way to size the revenue pickup from this, either anchoring to the forward curve or current rates? You put out some crude analysis that showed about a $2 billion impact and just said it was linear. So half this year, half next, but obviously it's a rough cut at it. So I don't know, if you have any comments on that or frame it on using your estimates. Thanks.\nRobert Reilly: No, I would say -- so we laid it out in the slides in terms of what we see in terms of runoff. And obviously the projected AOCI burned down as it relates to capital, but all of that's in our guide. So in terms of what our expectations are, in terms of that behavior, that's in our full year NII guide, which is down 4% to 5%. But it does make the point in terms of what we were saying earlier. And going forward, the biggest variable is the repricing of our fixed rate assets than in this case securities.\nWilliam Demchak: Matt, I think what everybody's struggling with here is this notion of what's the Fed going to do in the next period of time. Is it new cuts or no cuts or three cuts, and we started out with six cuts.\nRobert Reilly: We didn't.\nWilliam Demchak: Yeah. We did not, but the market did. We know based on forward curve the repricing of our fixed rate assets, the amount of money, incremental money we will earn from that has increased because term rates have increased. At the same time, that the assumption that the Fed will maintain rates here longer causes us to pause on what happens to deposit pricing through time, right? So there's a tradeoff. Higher rates in the long run, obviously help us on our fixed rate assets. Deposit repricing continues on if the Fed holds longer. A much slower pace than it's been in the past, but I think it's -- it would be a bit of a heroic assumption for anybody to say that deposit cost will continue to creep up in the face of a steady Fed. And so that's the trade off in the near term. Longer term, the repricing of the fixed rate assets towards the repricing of deposits. And that's kind of why we say, look, in the second quarter we trough, and then we pick up from there.\nRobert Reilly: And then to '25.\nWilliam Demchak: Yeah.\nMatt O'Connor: That makes sense. And then, sorry if I missed it earlier, but did you reiterate your view that 2025 net interest income would be record level? And if you did, what would derail that if the higher prolong or doesn't sound like -- doesn't sound like that'll change it. Is there still a loan growth component or if rates go down too much, just what would be the risk of achieving that if you still have that view? Thank you.\nWilliam Demchak: I mean, the biggest risk would be a massive curve inversion, such that we were repricing fixed rate securities at lower yields than they are today. Well, I mean then what they were three months ago. Our original assumptions in that forecast yields were hundred lower than they are right now. If they were to fall well below that, we would be at risk at that record number, although, still a high number.\nRobert Reilly: And Matt, this is Rob. It's Rob. I'll take the opportunity to reiterate our view that 2025 will be a record NII.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\nGerard Cassidy: Hi, Bill. Hi, Rob.\nWilliam Demchak: Hey, Gerard.\nRobert Reilly: Hey, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Rob, you talked about the utilization of the C&I loans that it was lower in the first quarter and normally it kind of ticks up a bit. Question on that. Is it -- do you think your customers are just uncertain about their outlooks, which has kind of helped them back from drawing down on lines of credit, or do you think that they're having access to other lenders, meaning private credit market or the public markets that has taken away opportunities for banks to have these companies increase those lines of utilization?\nWilliam Demchak: Yes. I think it's both. Yeah. The capital markets activity in the first quarter, we're not -- the private credit side on leverage finance doesn't really impact us, but the public markets were wide open, by the way, our fees were up in that space for serving clients that way, but naturally at the margin that causes our utilization to go down. The other issue you can't ignore, right? But we've seen capital spend and inventory bill be next to nothing, even though capacity utilization is high, retail sales are high. And at some point that's got to give. But I do think there continues to be hesitancy on manufacturers in particular, just in the face of this economy, and I think that's part of it.\nRobert Reilly: And looking for a stability factor which will help.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then I know, Rob, I think you touched on, in an answer to a question about the commercial real estate outlook office in particular. And you guys, everything appears to be going in your expectations. What kind of pricing declines in appraisals that have come up and where you've had to reappraise certain properties. Are you seeing price declines 10%, 15% 20% on those appraisals or more, any color there?\nRobert Reilly: I mean, much higher than that.\nGerard Cassidy: Okay.\nWilliam Demchak: Of variance.\nRobert Reilly: The variance is all over the place. But as a practical matter, if we were underwritten at the start at $0.50 to $0.55 on whatever the appraised value was at that point in time, a big chunk of the book right now is effectively at par, and we look at resolutions that we've gone through. We've had everything from we get out whole to we lose $0.75 on the $1 on a given loan.\nWilliam Demchak: That's the variance factor.\nRobert Reilly: So, it's building specific. It's market specific, that's driving this. But loss rates are a lot higher. If you looked at office and said, hey, how much of values fall, it's a lot higher than 15%. Personally across the space, my view is closer to 30 or 40 or even higher.\nWilliam Demchak: And you're thinking ahead. You're thinking ahead in terms of where we're going.\nRobert Reilly: Well, it's not showing up in appraisals here. We're just seeing it in actual resolution of properties.\nGerard Cassidy: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Dave Rochester with Compass Point. Please proceed with your questions.\nDave Rochester: Hey. Good morning, guys. Just back on the NII guide, you mentioned the largest driver of the growth you're looking for in the back half of the year is coming from the repricing, then you got the loan growth as another factor. Was just wondering what you're assuming for deposit flows within that as well? I would assume that this could be a little bit better, just from a seasonal perspective in the back half of the year. And then on the securities rolling off, how much of that liquidity is getting plowed back into the securities book and what kind of yields are you looking at there at this point on purchases?\nWilliam Demchak: So, I'll let Rob hit deposits in a second. The assumption, I mean we have roll off both fixed rate loans and fixed rate securities. And the yields we assume in our forecast at this point are just forward curve, adjusted from whatever the right spread is of the asset we'd replacing, so like-for-like.\nRobert Reilly: Yeah. And then just on the deposits. Back at the beginning of the year, we expected deposits to decline year-over-year low-single digits. We still expect that, albeit in the first quarter. We did outperform that a bit, but our expectations are for again slightly lower deposits through the balance of the year.\nDave Rochester: Okay. And then on the loan growth outlook, which you talked about, I guess, on an end to period basis last quarter. Does higher for longer impact that expectation at all and what's your outlook for the longer end of the curve through the year?\nWilliam Demchak: No. I don't know that I've thought much about how higher for longer impacts loan growth or not. The outlook that we have for rates at this point, our official outlook is we have, what do we say, two cuts starting in July at this point with the curve largely staying where it is. Our forecast, whether we're using current forward curve or even when rates were lower, our NII forecast isn't terribly sensitive to what we're assuming at least for this year because the incremental amount we'd make from higher yields on bonds and loans repricing, we're assuming is largely offset on the deposit cost leakage that occurs if the Fed doesn't cut rates. So we're not making heroic assumptions on rates. We don't really care where they go in the near term. What we know is once we get through the second quarter here, that the repricing of fixed rate assets simply starts to devore the potential repricing on deposits, and depending on where rates are.\nDave Rochester: Got it. Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with the Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning. I guess maybe the tenth question on your loan growth outlook for the back half, I think, I guess the macro concern is that higher for longer will eventually tip this economy into a recession. Would love to hear, Bill, Rob your perspective based on what you are hearing from your bankers clients? If we don't get any rate cuts for the year based on what you're seeing, like could we have a blind spot where the economy really kind of tails off, where a lot of these things catch up, we enter some version of a stack ration. Just how do you handicap that downside risk heading into the back half of the year?\nWilliam Demchak: Look, I think that's a possibility. One of the peculiar things about utilization is when credit conditions tighten, the utilization increases. It's actually one of the primary drivers of utilization. So bizarrely, loan growth would increase if you ran because utilization would increase if you ran into that scenario. But I do worry about that. Look, eventually if the only way to get rid of inflation is to really hurt the economy. I worry less about loan growth and more about long-term credit losses for the whole industry, just as right now everybody's planning for a soft landing.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. And you still think soft lending is base case in terms of most likely outcome right now?\nWilliam Demchak: Yes.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. And separately, one, I think thanks for your advocacy and bank M&A. Just wanted to follow up on the letter you wrote to the OCC. One, are you finding any kind of sympathy within the regulatory apparatus around the case for allowing for larger bank M&A? And is there any possibility that we should deal making pick up ahead of the elections?\nWilliam Demchak: Sorry. And any possibility of what?\nEbrahim Poonawala: Of deal making picking up ahead of the November elections?\nWilliam Demchak: Look, the letter was self-explanatory and we've kind of beaten the topic to death. I guess what I would suggest is, I think the banking industry by and large is set up to do well over the next 18 months or so simply through rates normalizing, assuming you didn't have big concentrations to real estate in office. And I think everybody in the near term is focused on that. I think long term, some of the charts we put in that letter. It's just hard to ignore. You see the two largest banks in the country who in the last four years grew of size, larger than Truist U.S. Bank and PNC put together. I don't know what the regulators think or don't think about that. The intent of the letter was to just point out that if what they wrote in the OCC comment letter was to freeze M&A across the country for any bank over $50 billion, I think you could see the outcome that we'll have in this country, which is a massive consolidation with the giant national banks. That's all my point was.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. And do you see the backdrop conducive for deal making over the coming months, quarters or?\nWilliam Demchak: Like, what?\nRobert Reilly: To anything near term for us or the industry.\nWilliam Demchak: No. I think most banks are content to hang out the next 18 months because their earnings are going to improve and their internal forecasts are going to look good and everything's rosy. I worry about the out years. But in the near term, I imagine everybody's internal looks pretty good.\nRobert Reilly: And we don't control others timing, so that's up to them.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That's right. Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.\nBill Carcache: Thanks. Good morning, Bill and Rob. Following up on your comments around soft loan demand and utilization rates, assuming we avoid recession and the soft landing scenario plays out, how would you respond to the view that the ingredients may not be in place for a reacceleration in loan growth given this environment where Fed funds is running above CPI and the Fed can't cut amidst sticky inflation? We spent most of the post GFC with Fed funds running below CPI and had mid-single digit loan growth, but just love your thoughts on the risk that loan growth may not go up much if the Fed can't cut below CPI? And do you lean more heavily into your fee-based businesses if that happens?\nWilliam Demchak: I'm not sure Fed funds versus CPI necessarily has much to do with loan growth. I think loan growth ultimately is driven by the economy, and the economy has been running hotter than most people had assumed. Then it's been running hotter than most people had assumed without big inventory builds. If you look at fourth quarter GDP, there was a drawdown on inventories. Inventories are directly correlated with utilization and loan growth, and CapEx has been muted. So, the economy slows. If the Fed has to slow the economy to a point where it's not a soft landing in order to get inflation under control, that can hurt loan growth. But if the economy is strong, you just saw retail sales, eventually it's going to translate into loan growth, independent of whether or not there's positive real rates.\nRobert Reilly: Yeah. I think that strong correlation there.\nWilliam Demchak: Yeah.\nBill Carcache: That's helpful. Thank you. And then, as a follow up on your comments about the Visa B shares. How should we think about the dollar amount and the use of proceeds?\nRobert Reilly: Well, as I mentioned our comments on May 3, we'll have the opportunity to monetize 50% of our holdings, which our holdings are roughly $1 billion fix in unrealized gains. And that'll just be capital and we'll look at how we apply everything in terms of our excess capital, but we'll wait until we get the capital to do that.\nBill Carcache: Got it. Thank you for taking my questions.\nRobert Reilly: And monetize half of the 1.6.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jeffries. Please proceed with your questions.\nKen Usdin: Hey, guys. Good morning. Just to follow up on the fee side, I think when you spoke in January, you talked about expected slowness in capital markets in M&A to begin the year. And then, I think you were thinking about a 20% growth overall. Just wondering just how that's looking in terms of the body language you're getting from those middle market clients in Harris Williams? And then also if you have any other color on what you think the other drivers of fees are going to be? Thanks.\nWilliam Demchak: I mean, the Harris Williams pipeline at the moment is larger, larger than it's ever been, but it's larger than it was last year, which the first quarter relative to their fourth quarter results, and that's what drove the quarter-on-quarter change in our total fees.\nRobert Reilly: Yeah. We had -- so, Ken, to answer your question, we are sticking to the 20% expectation for growth in capital markets year-over-year. Bill is right. First quarter was off elevated at fourth quarter levels. But in terms of the comp, last year in the second and third quarter capital markets was really soft. Harris Williams was really soft. And the pipeline suggests we are not going to repeat that. We'll be well above those levels.\nKen Usdin: Okay. Got it. All right. And the last one just on, on the asset and wealth side, I think you've had some pretty good flows, things like that, that first quarter starting point was more the markets. I know you put a lot of effort into that business. Any sense of just change in terms of like asset flows and new business wins and incremental potential revenue growth out of that business specifically?\nWilliam Demchak: We have had success over the last year kind of repositioning who and what we are in the market, bringing in new assets. To accelerate that to a level where it becomes a meaningful part of our company, I think, is a bit of a challenge. It's a service to our clients, and we're good at it. But the trends are going the right way.\nRobert Reilly: Yeah. I would just add to that, Ken. Obviously, the business is doing well with the equity markets supporting that. The growth opportunity is in the new BBVA markets in the southwest, where you'll recall, BBVA really didn't have a wealth management business, so we're de novo, so to speak, in all those markets. But we're up and running with teams, inflows, asset inflows are occurring. And long term, that's where the incremental growth will come from.\nKen Usdin: And one more just follow-up. Is that an area that you could add to organically over time? I know it's tough just because of multiples and whatnot, but you've done it organically, as you just said.\nWilliam Demchak: That's a tough business in my view to add to inorganically. Cultural differences, the way you go to market, the outright price and the goodwill associated with it and the return on equity that comes with that makes it all really difficult to do. And at least historically the opportunity to grow organically is much stronger than going out and trying to add to it through purchase.\nKen Usdin: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next questions come from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.\nMike Mayo: Hi. Looks like we're leaning into the expense control this quarter, but I'm just trying to figure out ahead. So you mentioned $750 million of cost savings for this year. How much of that was in the first quarter? But you also mentioned $1 billion of extra spending for branches. How much of that was in the first quarter and how should we think about those offsets? And I know it's a tough fight to get positive optimum leverage this year. Do you feel better or works the same as you did three months ago? Thanks.\nRobert Reilly: Well. Yeah, we'll chunk that down. So we'll start with the positive operating leverage for this full year. We still think that's pretty tough, not including any Visa gains, of course, simply because of the NII and the rate issues and those run rates. We do feel good about our expenses. We projected and guided to being stable year-over-year. We're off to a good start in the first quarter, a little bit ahead where we expected to be, but we still got a long way to go. So all of the items that you talked about there in there, but the guidance is stable over year-over-year, which is important to us.\nMike Mayo: Okay. I'll shift gears back. Bill, you were talking about commercial real estate. Look, you reserved 10% for office. And you said the value of the underlying properties are probably down 30% to 40% or more. So I guess that is reflected in your reserving, which I think is more than the average bank. Do you see a difference by, and I know it changes by region and subregion and property and type and all that, but do you see a difference by region, whether it's the big cities? What -- give a little sense of that variance because it's all over the place. You just fill in a few data points around that, that'd be great.\nWilliam Demchak: Yeah. Look, no surprise, parts of California are the worst. But it really comes down to the building and the market. I mean, you could have a building that's in the right place in Pittsburgh, and it's doing absolutely fine and you could have a building that's in the wrong place in Pittsburgh, and it's literally worth zero. And that's the market we're playing with right now. Now, inside of that whole thing, we do feel that we've been ahead of this game, that were reserved correctly, that we are conservatively taking marks and we had the opportunity to do so. But it's going to play out over time. And your eyes aren't lying to you when you look out and see vacancies. And I think ourselves and the large banks have been pretty open about, it's going to be an issue. It's not a massive book of business for us. I'm not particularly worried about it. We're well reserved, but it's going to roll through the country and impact some of the smaller banks, I think in a way that is probably larger than people [Multiple Speakers]. Yeah.\nMike Mayo: And just one short follow up on that one. The longer rates stay higher, do you expect this to bleed over from office to other areas of commercial real estate?\nWilliam Demchak: With the margin, yes. But it is kind of just at the margin. So you see debt service coverage ratios decline as interest costs take more of the cash flow out in multifamily, for example, rents aren't increasing at the pace they once were. The massive difference though, Mike, is that all other types, or virtually all other types of real estate are cash flowing. So there's a value to them, right? They just might not cash flow to support the original amount of debt they had. The problem you have in office is in many instances, there's no cash flow at all. It's really a unique animal at the moment.\nMike Mayo: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your questions.\nJohn McDonald: Hey, guys. Just wanted to just touch base on how you're thinking about capital build. Obviously, you're building organically, you've got some Visa that will add 14, 15 bps next quarter, I guess. Are you just kind of thinking of gradually kind of building from this? 10% reported and the 8.3% fully loaded to get to 9% or 10% or so over the next year, do a little bit of buybacks. Just kind of what's the plan there?\nWilliam Demchak: Well, you phrased the question almost exactly correctly, so congratulations. [Multiple Speakers] You think about it inside, we have always moving pieces. So inside of the NPR on Basel III end game. The one thing, it's all up in the year -- but one thing that you got to believe is going to stick as AOCI. And so if that's the case, then our printed A3 number is kind of a real number, and that would be otherwise too low for us if we want to build that through time. Some of that will happen just from the rundown of the book and some of that will happen through us building capital. The ultimate, where should we be Basel III end game, everything settled out number, I don't know that we've necessarily set yet other than it's higher than where we sit today on the A3. I think that\u2019s\u2026\nRobert Reilly: No. That's fair. And we've got capital flexibility, as you know, John, and that's where you want to be right now with the fluidity of everything.\nJohn McDonald: And so for the near term, Rob, is this kind of the ballpark $100 million a little bit north of that? Is that kind of the ballpark until you get a little more clarity?\nRobert Reilly: Yeah. That's right.\nWilliam Demchak: Yeah.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Bryan Gill for closing comments.\nBryan Gill: Well, thank you all for joining the PNC call this morning. And if you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to the IR team. Take care.\nWilliam Demchak: Thank you.\nOperator: Sorry about that. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "William Demchak",
            "content": "Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we executed well and delivered solid financial results. We generated $1.3 billion in net income, and adjusting for the FDIC special assessment $3.36 per share. Rob will provide details on our results in a moment, but I'll start with a few thoughts. First, we continue to grow our business. In the first quarter, we added new customers across our segments and increased deposits on a spot basis. We're continuing to invest heavily in our franchise to drive growth and gain share, particularly in our retail banking technology platform or payments businesses and our expansion markets. To that end, in the first quarter, we announced a multiyear investment of nearly $1 billion in our branch network to renovate more than 1,200 locations and open new branches in key locations, including Austin, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Miami and San Antonio. Second, expenses were well managed during the quarter. As we've indicated, expense discipline remains a top priority, and we are on track to maintain stable core expenses in 2024. Third, credit quality remains stable during the quarter. The office portfolio remains an area of focus, but we are adequately reserved overall, and particularly with respect to CRE. We believe our thoughtful approach to managing risk, customer selection and long-term relationship development will continue to serve us well. And fourth, we continue to build on our strong liquidity and capital position during the quarter, providing us with a financial strength and flexibility to help us support our clients grow our businesses and capitalize on future opportunities. In summary, we delivered solid results during the first quarter and positioned ourselves well for the balance of 2024 and beyond. Last month, we launched a brand campaign celebrating our boring approach to banking. Now obviously, we're using humor in the campaign to have a little fun and grab the public's attention. But inside of that humor is honesty about who we are, how we think about risk, and how we run our company. In short, it is everything we do to be steady and predictable. Finally, I just want to thank our employees for everything they do for our customers, for each other, and for all of our stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to rob to take you through the quarter. Rob? Good morning. Sure. I was just going to say that the largest driver is repricing of fixed rate assets. We expect some loan growth, but it's not a heroic number in there. It's simply to roll down of our securities book. It's a variety of things. I think the capital markets activity in the first quarter in investment-grade debt put a lot of cash into the system and you just -- you saw companies that could hit that market, pay down revolver. So that was sort of a near term impact to it. There's -- as when we look out, there hasn't been any real inventory build, which I would expect given retail sales. There hasn't been much CapEx and capacity utilization has been holding constant at a pretty high level. So, at some point this needs to turn, but I think the first quarter kind of surprised us. And my best guess was that was on the back of just how liquid the public markets were. Hey. John. Bleed is a bad word. The credit action at the moment is in the real estate book and specifically inside of office, consumer at the margin a little bit worse, but there isn't anything systematic going on in C&I that would cause us to have any different expectations of what we see now, and we're reserved for the moment based on our economic forecast. Matt, I think what everybody's struggling with here is this notion of what's the Fed going to do in the next period of time. Is it new cuts or no cuts or three cuts, and we started out with six cuts. Yeah. We did not, but the market did. We know based on forward curve the repricing of our fixed rate assets, the amount of money, incremental money we will earn from that has increased because term rates have increased. At the same time, that the assumption that the Fed will maintain rates here longer causes us to pause on what happens to deposit pricing through time, right? So there's a tradeoff. Higher rates in the long run, obviously help us on our fixed rate assets. Deposit repricing continues on if the Fed holds longer. A much slower pace than it's been in the past, but I think it's -- it would be a bit of a heroic assumption for anybody to say that deposit cost will continue to creep up in the face of a steady Fed. And so that's the trade off in the near term. Longer term, the repricing of the fixed rate assets towards the repricing of deposits. And that's kind of why we say, look, in the second quarter we trough, and then we pick up from there. Yeah. I mean, the biggest risk would be a massive curve inversion, such that we were repricing fixed rate securities at lower yields than they are today. Well, I mean then what they were three months ago. Our original assumptions in that forecast yields were hundred lower than they are right now. If they were to fall well below that, we would be at risk at that record number, although, still a high number. Hey, Gerard. Yes. I think it's both. Yeah. The capital markets activity in the first quarter, we're not -- the private credit side on leverage finance doesn't really impact us, but the public markets were wide open, by the way, our fees were up in that space for serving clients that way, but naturally at the margin that causes our utilization to go down. The other issue you can't ignore, right? But we've seen capital spend and inventory bill be next to nothing, even though capacity utilization is high, retail sales are high. And at some point that's got to give. But I do think there continues to be hesitancy on manufacturers in particular, just in the face of this economy, and I think that's part of it. Of variance. That's the variance factor. And you're thinking ahead. You're thinking ahead in terms of where we're going. So, I'll let Rob hit deposits in a second. The assumption, I mean we have roll off both fixed rate loans and fixed rate securities. And the yields we assume in our forecast at this point are just forward curve, adjusted from whatever the right spread is of the asset we'd replacing, so like-for-like. No. I don't know that I've thought much about how higher for longer impacts loan growth or not.

I worry less about loan growth and more about long-term credit losses for the whole industry, just as right now everybody's planning for a soft landing. Yes. Sorry. And any possibility of what? Look, the letter was self-explanatory and we've kind of beaten the topic to death.

That's all my point was. Like, what? No. I think most banks are content to hang out the next 18 months because their earnings are going to improve and their internal forecasts are going to look good and everything's rosy. I worry about the out years. But in the near term, I imagine everybody's internal looks pretty good. I'm not sure Fed funds versus CPI necessarily has much to do with loan growth. I think loan growth ultimately is driven by the economy, and the economy has been running hotter than most people had assumed. Then it's been running hotter than most people had assumed without big inventory builds. If you look at fourth quarter GDP, there was a drawdown on inventories.

But if the economy is strong, you just saw retail sales, eventually it's going to translate into loan growth, independent of whether or not there's positive real rates. Yeah. I mean, the Harris Williams pipeline at the moment is larger, larger than it's ever been, but it's larger than it was last year, which the first quarter relative to their fourth quarter results, and that's what drove the quarter-on-quarter change in our total fees. We have had success over the last year kind of repositioning who and what we are in the market, bringing in new assets. To accelerate that to a level where it becomes a meaningful part of our company, I think, is a bit of a challenge. It's a service to our clients, and we're good at it. But the trends are going the right way. That's a tough business in my view to add to inorganically. Cultural differences, the way you go to market, the outright price and the goodwill associated with it and the return on equity that comes with that makes it all really difficult to do. And at least historically the opportunity to grow organically is much stronger than going out and trying to add to it through purchase. Yeah. Look, no surprise, parts of California are the worst. But it really comes down to the building and the market. I mean, you could have a building that's in the right place in Pittsburgh, and it's doing absolutely fine and you could have a building that's in the wrong place in Pittsburgh, and it's literally worth zero. And that's the market we're playing with right now. Now, inside of that whole thing, we do feel that we've been ahead of this game, that were reserved correctly, that we are conservatively taking marks and we had the opportunity to do so. But it's going to play out over time. And your eyes aren't lying to you when you look out and see vacancies. And I think ourselves and the large banks have been pretty open about, it's going to be an issue. It's not a massive book of business for us. I'm not particularly worried about it. We're well reserved, but it's going to roll through the country and impact some of the smaller banks, I think in a way that is probably larger than people [Multiple Speakers]. Yeah. With the margin, yes. But it is kind of just at the margin. So you see debt service coverage ratios decline as interest costs take more of the cash flow out in multifamily, for example, rents aren't increasing at the pace they once were. The massive difference though, Mike, is that all other types, or virtually all other types of real estate are cash flowing. So there's a value to them, right? They just might not cash flow to support the original amount of debt they had. The problem you have in office is in many instances, there's no cash flow at all. It's really a unique animal at the moment. Well, you phrased the question almost exactly correctly, so congratulations. [Multiple Speakers] You think about it inside, we have always moving pieces. So inside of the NPR on Basel III end game. The one thing, it's all up in the year -- but one thing that you got to believe is going to stick as AOCI. And so if that's the case, then our printed A3 number is kind of a real number, and that would be otherwise too low for us if we want to build that through time. Some of that will happen just from the rundown of the book and some of that will happen through us building capital. The ultimate, where should we be Basel III end game, everything settled out number, I don't know that we've necessarily set yet other than it's higher than where we sit today on the A3. I think that's... Yeah. Thank you."

            "name": "Robert Reilly",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average linked quarter basis. Loans are $321 billion decreased $4 billion or 1%. Investment securities declined $2 billion or 1%. And our cash balances at the Federal Reserve were $48 billion, an increase of $6 billion or 13%. On a spot basis, our cash at the Fed was $53 billion, up from $43 billion in the prior quarter, reflecting higher period end deposits. Deposit balances averaged $420 billion, a decline of $4 billion or 1%, reflecting seasonally lower commercial deposits. However, on a spot basis, deposits were up $4 billion, reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer deposits. Borrowed funds increased $3 billion to $76 billion, primarily driven by parent company debt issuances early in the quarter. At quarter end, AOCI was a negative $8 billion compared to a negative $7.7 billion at December 31, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates. Our tangible book value increased to $85.70 per common share, an 11% increase compared to the same period a year ago. We remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 10.1% as of March 31. While we recognize the likelihood of potentially substantial changes to the Basel III endgame NPR under the currently proposed capital rules, our estimated fully phased in expanded risk-based CET1 ratio would be approximately 8.3% as of March 31, 2024. We continue to be well positioned with capital flexibility. Share repurchases approximated $135 million or roughly 1 million shares. And when combined with $624 million of common dividends, we returned $759 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter. Slide 5 shows our loans in more detail. Compared to the fourth quarter, average loan balances decreased 1%, primarily driven by lower commercial loan balances. Commercial loans were $219 billion, a decrease of $3.4 billion, driven by lower utilization as well as soft loan demand. Within the corporate and institutional bank, utilization rates have remained below 2023 year-end levels and have not increased in the first quarter as is historically typical. We expect utilization to increase throughout the year. Notably, each percent of utilization within CNIB equates to $4 billion of loan growth. Consumer loans declined approximately $600 million, driven by lower credit card and home equity balances, and total loan yields increased 7 basis points to 6.01% in the first quarter. Slide 6 details our investment, security and swap portfolios. Average investment securities of $135 billion decreased 1% as curtailed purchase activity was more than offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities. The securities portfolio yield increased 3 basis points to 2.62%, reflecting the run-off of lower yielding securities. As of March 31, the securities portfolio duration was four years. Our receive fixed swaps pointed to the commercial loan book totaled $37 billion on March 31. The weighted average receive fixed rate of our swap portfolio increased 20 basis points to 2.3% and the duration of the portfolio was two years. Through the end of 2024, 13% of our securities and swap portfolio is scheduled to mature, which will allow us to reinvest into higher yielding assets, providing a meaningful benefit to net interest income in the second half of the year. Accumulated other comprehensive income was negative $8 billion at March 31, which will accrete back as our securities and swaps mature, resulting in continued tangible book value growth. Slide 7 covers our deposits in more detail. Average deposits decreased $4 billion to $420 billion during the quarter, as growth in consumer deposits was more than offset by a seasonal decline in commercial deposits. Regarding mix, consolidated, non-interest-bearing deposits were 24% in the first quarter, down slightly from 25% in the fourth quarter. Notably, on a spot basis in the first quarter, non-interest-bearing deposits had the smallest dollar decline since the Fed began raising rates in 2022, which gives us confidence that the non-interest-bearing portion of our deposits has largely stabilized. Our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 2.6% during the first quarter, up from 2.48% in the prior quarter. And as of March 31, our cumulative deposit beta was 45% and consistent with our expectations. We believe our deposit betas have approached their peak levels, although, we do expect some potential drift higher through the period leading up to a Fed rate cut, which we currently expect to occur in July. In regard to the timing and amount of potential rate cuts, we recognize there's a lot of fluidity and uncertainty. However, our 2024 NII will largely be unaffected by any short-term interest rate movement or lack thereof. This is because our floating rate assets are aligned with our floating rate liabilities, including our high beta commercial interest-bearing deposits and our long-term debt, which is almost entirely swapped to floating rates. Importantly, going forward, we've remained well positioned for the NII benefit of repricing low yielding fixed rate securities and loans maturing during the latter half of 2024 and into 2025. Turning to the income statement on Slide 8. First quarter net income was $1.3 billion or $3.10 per share, which included a pretax, non-core, non-interest expense of $130 million or $103 million after tax related to the increased FDIC special assess assessment. Excluding non-core expenses, adjusted EPS was $3.36 per share. Total revenue of $5.1 billion decreased $216 million or 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Net interest income declined by $139 million or 4%, and our net interest margin was 2.57%, a decline of 9 basis points, resulting primarily from higher funding costs. Non-interest income decreased $77 million or 4%. Non-interest expense of $3.3 billion declined $740 million or 18%, and included $130 million FDIC special assessment. Importantly, core non-interest expense was $3.2 billion and decreased $205 million or 6%. Provision was $155 million in the first quarter, reflecting portfolio activity and improved macroeconomic factors, and our effective tax rate was 18.8%. Turning to Slide 9. We highlight our revenue trends. First quarter revenue was down $216 million or 4%, driven by lower net interest income and in part a seasonal decline in fee income. Net interest income of $3.3 billion declined $139 million or 4%, reflecting increased funding costs, lower loan balances, and one less day in the quarter. Fee income was $1.7 billion and decreased $74 million or 4% linked quarter. Looking at the detail. Asset management and brokerage revenue was up $4 million or 1%, reflecting higher average equity markets. Capital markets and advisory fees declined $50 million or 16%, driven by lower M&A advisory activity, off elevated fourth quarter levels, partially offset by higher underwriting fees. Card and cash management decreased $17 million or 2%, driven by seasonally lower consumer transaction volumes, partially offset by higher treasury management fees. Lending and deposit related fees declined $9 million or 3%, reflecting the reduction of customer fees on certain checking products. Residential and commercial mortgage revenue declined $2 million or 1%, and included lower residential mortgage activity. Other non-interest income of $135 million decreased $3 million or 2%, reflecting lower gains on sales. The first quarter also included a negative $7 million Visa fair value adjustment compared to a negative $100 million adjustment in the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 10. Our core non-interest expense at $3.2 billion decreased $205 million or 6% linked quarter, reflecting strong expense management. Importantly, compared to the first quarter of 2023, core non-interest expense declined $117 million or 4%, with a decline in every expense category. This broad-based result reflects the impact of expense actions taken in 2023. As we've previously stated, we implemented expense management actions that will drive $750 million of cost savings in 2024. These actions include the $325 million workforce reduction effort last year, which was realized in our first quarter expense run rate, and our $425 million 2024 continuous improvement program goal, which we're well on track to achieve. We remain diligent in our expense management efforts, and these actions give us confidence that will keep our year-over-year expenses stable. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 11. While overall credit quality remains resilient, the pressure we anticipated within the commercial real estate office sector has continued. Non-performing loans increased $200 million or 9% linked quarter, almost entirely driven by commercial real estate, which increased $188 million. And inside of that, approximately $150 million was related to the CRE office portfolio. Total delinquencies of $1.3 billion decreased $109 million or 8% linked quarter, driven by lower consumer and commercial delinquencies. Net loan charge-offs were $243 million in the first quarter, and our annualized net charge-offs to average loans ratio was 30 basis points. Our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.4 billion or 1.7% of total loans on March 31, stable with December 31. Slide 12 provides more detail on our CRE office credit metrics. While NPLs have increased over the past few quarters, our criticized balances have remained relatively consistent. The migration of criticized loans to non-performing status is an expected outcome as we work to resolve the occupancy and rate challenges inherent to this portfolio. In the first quarter, net loan charge-offs within the CRE office portfolio were $50 million, essentially in line with the previous quarter level. Ultimately, we expect continued charge-offs on this portfolio, and accordingly we believe we are adequately reserved. As of March 31, our reserves on the office portfolio were 9.7% of total office loans and inside of that, 14.4% on the multitenant portfolio. Importantly, we continue to manage our exposure down and as a result, our balances declined 3%, or approximately $200 million linked quarter. In summary, PNC reported a solid first quarter 2024, and we're well positioned for the remainder of the year. Regarding our view of the overall economy, we're expecting economic expansion in the second half of the year, resulting in real GDP growth of approximately 2% in 2024, and unemployment to increase modestly to 4% by year end. We expect the Fed to cut rates 2 times in 2024, with a 25 basis point decrease in July and another in November. Looking at the second quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2024, we expect average loans to be stable, net interest income to be down approximately 1%. And as I mentioned previously, we expect NII and net interest margin to trough in the second quarter. Fee income to be up 1% to 2%. Other non-interest income to be in the range of $150 million and $200 million, excluding Visa activity. Taking the component pieces of revenue together, we expect total revenue to be stable. We expect total core non-interest expense to be up 2% to 4%. We expect second quarter net charge-offs to be between $225 million and $275 million. As a reminder, PNC owns 3.5 million Visa class B shares with an unrecognized gain of approximately $1.6 billion. Under the terms of Visa's current exchange program scheduled to close on or about May 3, Class B shareholders will have the opportunity to monetize 50% of their holdings. We've not included the impact of monetizing the Visa gain in our forecast. Turning to Slide 14. Our full year 2024 guidance is unchanged from our January earnings call. And as a reminder, for the full year 2024 compared to the full year 2023, we expect average loan growth of approximately 1%. Total revenue to be stable to down 2%. Inside of that, our expectation is for net interest income to be down in the range of 4% to 5%, and non-interest income to be up 4% to 6%. Core non-interest expense, which excludes the FDIC assessment, is expected to be stable and we expect our affected tax rate to be approximately 18.5%. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions. Okay. Yeah. Good morning, Betsy. This is Rob. So in terms of NII and the trajectory that we're on, we knew at the beginning of the year that we would trough around this time in the second quarter and that's what's happening. We expect to grow from that trough level based on the repricing of our fixed rate assets as rates settle down. There is some reliance on the back half for loan growth, but all consistent with our full year guidance. Average loans up 1%. John, this is Rob. So I'd say, for the full year, we're still planning and guiding towards stable. In the first quarter, you're right, we're off to a good start, in terms of realizing the expense actions that we took last year and CIP program that we have this year. But it's a little early in the year to roll that all forward. And like I said, we're off to a good start and we're well positioned for stable. Yeah. The pressure is in the CRE book, specifically the office book. No surprises. Yeah. Everything's progressing as we expected. We started with the criticized, the NPLs are up a little bit, but everything is consistent with what we've been saying. No, I would say -- so we laid it out in the slides in terms of what we see in terms of runoff. And obviously the projected AOCI burned down as it relates to capital, but all of that's in our guide. So in terms of what our expectations are, in terms of that behavior, that's in our full year NII guide, which is down 4% to 5%. But it does make the point in terms of what we were saying earlier. And going forward, the biggest variable is the repricing of our fixed rate assets than in this case securities. We didn't. And then to '25. And Matt, this is Rob. It's Rob. I'll take the opportunity to reiterate our view that 2025 will be a record NII. Hey, Gerard. And looking for a stability factor which will help. I mean, much higher than that. The variance is all over the place. But as a practical matter, if we were underwritten at the start at $0.50 to $0.55 on whatever the appraised value was at that point in time, a big chunk of the book right now is effectively at par, and we look at resolutions that we've gone through. We've had everything from we get out whole to we lose $0.75 on the $1 on a given loan. So, it's building specific. It's market specific, that's driving this. But loss rates are a lot higher. If you looked at office and said, hey, how much of values fall, it's a lot higher than 15%. Personally across the space, my view is closer to 30 or 40 or even higher. Well, it's not showing up in appraisals here. We're just seeing it in actual resolution of properties. Yeah. And then just on the deposits. Back at the beginning of the year, we expected deposits to decline year-over-year low-single digits. We still expect that, albeit in the first quarter. We did outperform that a bit, but our expectations are for again slightly lower deposits through the balance of the year. To anything near term for us or the industry. And we don't control others timing, so that's up to them. Yeah. I think that strong correlation there. Well, as I mentioned our comments on May 3, we'll have the opportunity to monetize 50% of our holdings, which our holdings are roughly $1 billion fix in unrealized gains. And that'll just be capital and we'll look at how we apply everything in terms of our excess capital, but we'll wait until we get the capital to do that. And monetize half of the 1.6. Yeah. We had -- so, Ken, to answer your question, we are sticking to the 20% expectation for growth in capital markets year-over-year. Bill is right. First quarter was off elevated at fourth quarter levels. But in terms of the comp, last year in the second and third quarter capital markets was really soft. Harris Williams was really soft. And the pipeline suggests we are not going to repeat that. We'll be well above those levels. Yeah. I would just add to that, Ken. Obviously, the business is doing well with the equity markets supporting that. The growth opportunity is in the new BBVA markets in the southwest, where you'll recall, BBVA really didn't have a wealth management business, so we're de novo, so to speak, in all those markets. But we're up and running with teams, inflows, asset inflows are occurring. And long term, that's where the incremental growth will come from. Well. Yeah, we'll chunk that down. So we'll start with the positive operating leverage for this full year. We still think that's pretty tough, not including any Visa gains, of course, simply because of the NII and the rate issues and those run rates. We do feel good about our expenses. We projected and guided to being stable year-over-year. We're off to a good start in the first quarter, a little bit ahead where we expected to be, but we still got a long way to go. So all of the items that you talked about there in there, but the guidance is stable over year-over-year, which is important to us. No. That's fair. And we've got capital flexibility, as you know, John, and that's where you want to be right now with the fluidity of everything. Yeah. That's right."
