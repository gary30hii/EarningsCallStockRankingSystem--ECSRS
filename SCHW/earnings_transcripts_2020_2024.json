        "content": "Rich Fowler: And we are live. Good morning everyone, welcome to Schwab's Fall 2020 Business Update. This is Rich Fowler, Head of Investor Relations coming to you from a still sparsely populated 211 Main Street in San Francisco. Well I want to extend a particular welcome to those of you attending this session as new owners or followers of Schwab, due to our recent acquisition of TD Ameritrade, we certainly hope everyone on the call and your families remain safe and well in this environment. And we thank you for spending time with us today. There's a full lineup of earnings reports for many of you to deal with. And we certainly have a full agenda here.  So we're going to get things underway quickly. Joining me today, both virtually and literally are Walt Bettinger, our President and CEO; Joe Martinetto, Senior EVP and COO, and Chief Financial Officer Peter Crawford. Now those of you experienced with our interim updates will immediately recognize that Joe's participation signals, that we're not following traditional practice today. And we are indeed planning to spend a longer than normal session, say around an hour and a quarter with these three, bringing you up to date on life at Schwab right now, starting off with some prepared comments and following up with Q&A until it's time to wrap up.  Our goal is always is to keep you current regarding management's thinking as efficiently as possible. We will follow tradition on questions. So we'll do so via the webcast console, as well as the dial in and as always, to help us get to as many folks as possible, we very much appreciate your sticking to one plus follow on in the approach to questions. Walt will start us off today to discuss our strategic picture, which includes both the continuing story of the company's performance during the pandemic and the implications of closing the Ameritrade acquisition. And then Joe is here to share an update on the integration process as we dig in on this front. Peter will review the recent financial performance of both firms on a standalone basis and then move to discussing the current outlook for the combined company before taking us into Q&A.  Before that, let's spend a second on the wonderful wall of words, holding steady at a single riveting page, the main point of which is to remind everyone that outcomes can differ from expectations. So please keep an eye on our disclosures. Finally, the slides will be posted on the IR side during Peters prepared remarks. I think that's it administratively.  So Walt, I think we're ready to get going over to you. \nWalt Bettinger : Thank you, Rich and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. During certainly what continues to be extraordinary times we all recognize that we're living in a unique and challenging time for everyone. And my best wishes for good health and safety go out to all of you who are joining us on the call. It's really times to like these that have focused and consistent strategy means more than ever, the noise around us from a struggling economy a record low interest rates, a degree of political turmoil can shake those less committed to a sound long term approach.  At Schwab, we remain as committed as ever to our two client side strategy and our key strategic initiatives, scale monetization and segmentation. Our approach is winning in the market. And we believe that our combination with TD Ameritrade will deliver outstanding financial results along with furthering our competitive position in key client segments. As I've said before, we are on offense. And the response from our clients with record and near record metrics supports the efforts that we're making to offer world class value service advice and transparency. Now as of October 6, we have successfully completed the four acquisitions that were announced in the past 15 months. Each of these transactions are strategically important for us, but of course in different ways and each slots in perfectly with those key strategic initiatives I mentioned previously of scale monetization and segmentation. USAA adds to our scale of existing clients. And our exclusive Wealth Management referral arrangement that we have with USAA continues, adding scale for us and should be effective for years to come.  Motive delivers highly talented technologists along with a platform that is helping accelerate our efforts to deliver thematic investing, as well as direct indexing to investors and advisors. And of course, that will in time contribute to our efforts around monetization. That is good for clients. Wasmer, Schroeder accomplishes a similar goal, monetization that's good for our clients, but with maybe a more traditional approach to investment solutions in the fixed income area, and of course their expertise in tax smart fixed income investing is likely to prove especially valuable, as tax rates potentially become an increasingly important consideration for investors after the election.  Of course, the TD Ameritrade acquisition not only builds tremendous scale, but it also delivers outstanding capabilities that serve our segmentation objective. We know that they had a best in class platform for traders, several capabilities that are highly valued within the investment advisor community also. This slide graphically illustrates the scale impact of the TD Ameritrade acquisition. Also it shows the powerful combination of our firm's with net new assets in excess of $75 billion, and almost 1.5 million new brokerage accounts in the third quarter alone, keeping in mind that that third quarter included tax payments, unlike in most years. Now, Peters going to speak a little bit later regarding the near term and longer term financial benefits of our transaction. But for now, I will simply say that they are significant.  Now as strong as our asset gathering and overall financial performance has been we see many untapped opportunities to drive significant asset and revenue growth by leveraging our scale, better monetizing assets in ways that are good for clients, and developing leading offers for key segments of our client base. The M&A has played an important role in pursuing these initiatives. But M&A activity is only one way that will drive these efforts forward with all three key initiatives contributing to our strong growth.  Through the first three quarters of 2020, and of course, this is looking exclusively at Schwab results, clients and trusted us with core net new assets in excess of $160 billion, a 5% organic growth rate, which is consistent with our long term results. Included in there is an all-time monthly record for the month of September with $20 billion in core net new assets. I remember when we reached $2 trillion in firm wide assets, the number one question I received was always could Schwab continue to capture an organic net new asset growth rate in that 5% to 7% range even on such a large base.  Of course, we were confident that we could back down and we remain equally confident today. That'd be sure we talk about a range because as we all recognize that there will be some variability driven by market conditions, as well as employment conditions and those contribute to either accelerating or decelerating money in motion, and therefore, new assets in our category. I think what's clear, though, is what won't change is our ability to keep winning assets, and continue gaining market share, regardless of whatever the environment is around us.  Our organic efforts around scale are also paying dividends in terms of operating efficiency, with almost two thirds of our client households now digitally active, over half of the arrays we serve are leveraging our digital service capabilities. And over three fourths of our client base is now enrolled in paperless reporting. Here is an example of where the pandemic that we're dealing with has actually contributed to more rapid adoption of digital capabilities. And of course, digital adoption and digital initiatives are what I like to refer to as triple wins. And by that I mean that they result in a better experience for our clients through both faster processing as well as a richer overall experience. They contribute to lowering error rates, and also lowering costs for Schwab. And, of course, that in turn benefits both our stockholders as well as our employees as our employees are able to engage in more value added interactions with our clients.  Let me emphasize though, that adoption of digital does not mean that people and specifically our branches in our service centers don't matter. In fact, arguably, they matter as much or more than ever. What digital adoption does mean is that employees can focus on relationships, more than simply processing transactions. And of course, that's exactly what we want, what our clients want, and what we mean when we talk about bringing together really the best of people and technology to our no tradeoffs value proposition. We've demonstrated that when we offer clients and this is both on the retail side and on the RA side, when we offer them high quality solutions at very competitive prices, they vote with their fee [ph].  Use above Schwab managed ETFs is growing again, after a slow down earlier in 2020, largely due to tax last harvesting. Clients continue to enroll in our retail advisory programs, we now have assets they're exceeding $360 billion and clients are increasingly turning to Schwab bank for their lending needs, with loans up over 30% from one year ago. Our success with our asset management and lending products also fuels our confidence in continuing to extend our capabilities. And part of that is ensuring that third party managers provide appropriate compensation for the many services that we provide them and the investors who invest in their products through our platform. These types of efforts will further diversify our model and decrease our reliance on spread based revenue. Whether it's from ongoing negotiations with fund complexes that rely on Schwab to provide shareholder servicing, without helping us cover those costs, to substantial opportunities in thematic investing and direct indexing, to the growth opportunity in the area of retail advisory services and last but not least to the opportunity to deliver premier fixed income advisory to clients at a great value through in house Wasmer Schroeder.  At the same time, we're working hard to build and deliver increasingly segmented capabilities to delight clients of all sizes and types. Whether they are targeted at newer younger investors, which certainly gets a lot of press today, new and creative ways to invest in a more customized or personalized manner through themes and direct indexing, better serving the fastest growing segment of our retail business, which is high net worth and ultra high net worth investors. And creating new and more streamlined experiences for independent investment advisors that we serve and of course, we serve all sides, investment advisors large, small, and in between.  As I've said for a number of years, the future in our industry, in our view belongs to the organizations that deliver a no tradeoffs approach to investing, great value, transparency and trust, omni channel service, a single place to meet all of it investors needs all of this from a company that is both a challenger to the rest of the industry, as well as a beacon of confidence due to our size and scale. In our words, it's no tradeoffs, no limits and all done through client size. At Schwab, we call that modern wealth management. And we think that uniquely define Schwab and is only achievable by a firm with our size, scale, and importantly our focus. In our view, our capabilities, our rather simple strategy, our enormous scale, our culture of service, and our commitment as a challenger company, to continue disrupting to benefit investors and advisors is a combination that no one else in the market can match. In our transfer of account or asset figures tell the story better than I ever could, attracting $2 from core competitors for every dollar they take from us. Strong results versus the global banks and warehouses at 2.2 to one. Strong results versus the independent broker dealers at 1.8 to one an exceptionally strong results versus the mono line fin-tech companies that were asked about so frequently at a ratio of over 200 to one. All contributing to a firm wide TOA [ph] ratio of two to one and as successful as both TD Ameritrade and Schwab have been in taking share for the past four decades the reality is we still collectively have a very small share of an enormous wealth management market in the US.  So just in closing, we know that we are dealing with record low interest rates, and those create short term headwinds. Eventually we'll have relief from this pandemic. Eventually, the economy will get fully back on its feet. Eventually, our belief is that interest rates won't remain at all-time record lows. But in the meantime, we won't be here off course. We won't deviate from our through client side strategy. We won't stop being on offense with our key strategic initiatives of scale monetization and segmentation. And we surely won't stop pursuing disruptive actions that benefit clients, the very soul of a challenger. For those of you who know Schwab, well, you know that we don't measure our progress in quarters, and generally not even in years, but rather in decades. And I've never been more optimistic about what the future decades hold for Schwab.  So I want to transition over to Joe Martinetto, I'm pleased that we're now in a position to begin the process that actually unleashes the potential from combining Schwab and TD Ameritrade as all of you know, Joe is leading that effort. And I know he's looking forward to sharing an initial update on our integration efforts.  So Joe, let me turn it over to you. \nJoe Martinetto : Great, thanks Walt and good morning, everybody. So today, I would characterize my presentation as more of a cameo than a full update. I'd remind everybody that we just closed the transaction a couple of weeks ago. And we were able to do a fair amount of integration planning prior to close. But there are a lot of details that we've just recently been able to share, while we feel very good about the work we've done, and what we're seeing, we're going to need a little time to firm up the executional plans and financial implications before we can provide you with that fuller update. That said, we've already made a number of decisions about platforms and client experience that we'll share today. And we've also moved quickly to recognize some of the closer in synergies; I'll update you on those activities as well.  So let's start with the expense synergies first. Just a reminder, our targets at the time of announcement called for us to realize between $1.8 billion and $2 billion in expense reduction synergies. We spent the last 10 plus months developing plans to achieve this level of savings. And by close we had high level plans at the business unit level to achieve it. We still believe it will take 18 to 36 months to get through broker dealer consolidation, account conversion, and the shutdown of all the redundant systems and functions that are necessary to achieve this level of savings. I'll have more to say about the timeline in a couple of slides.  I'm also focused today on expense synergies as those are likely to occur in a more material way more quickly than revenue synergies. As we've discussed before, the bigger revenue synergies come from the repatriation of the BDA balances, but we do expect that there will also be revenue synergies that are tied to the account conversion, when we'll be able to offer the best of both companies products and services to the combined client base. Those outcomes will be a little longer coming as we're still operating as two separate broker dealers today. With respect to the expense actions, we've already taken steps to achieve between $250 million and $300 million in expense reductions. We've aligned the management structure, and across management in the branch network eliminated over about 1000 roles. We moved aggressively to rationalize the branch network; there was a significant amount of overlap across our footprints which we're eliminating. Of their roughly 260 branches, we're retaining about 55; the majority of the rest will co locate into nearby Schwab branches, where we'll have both Schwab and TD Ameritrade employees.  Our combined branch footprint after the consolidation will be larger with over 400 branches a 140 of which will be shared through conversion, and 90% of our clients will have a branch within 25 miles up from 80% before the transaction. We've also closed the number of previously open management positions, as well as reduced our anticipated marketing spend. While it'll take some time to recognize the full level of synergies, we expect to see additional reductions over the course of the next 36 months. And with the meaningful reductions that I just noted along with other actions that we plan to take, we're thinking we'll exit the first year after the transaction with between one quarter and one third of the expense synergy total in the run rate. Moving on to some of the platform decisions as we've said all along we expect to realize the best of both when it comes to customer facing platforms. Both companies have well regarded and recognized platforms with very complementary strengths. We expect to leverage the existing Schwab's websites mobile applications for investor's independent advisors in automated investing solutions. We'll be adding the thinkorswim web and mobile experiences for traders and supplementing the advisor experience with the trading and rebalancing capabilities from TD Ameritrade advisor platform. That said, we expect that there'll be changes to all of these platforms that we'll need to make for a seamless experience for our combined clients. For example, the trading experience on schwab.com will evolve a bit to serve the more active traders from TD Ameritrade who prefer to use the web. The Schwab Advisor Center will incorporate more integrations with third party platforms to accommodate the advisors who use services where we don't currently have an easy to use integration. I promised I'd have more to say about the timeline for integration earlier and I'd like to remind folks that this is an extraordinarily complex integration. Both firms are large in their own rights and when you combine them and look to add the headroom that's necessary to handle potential spikes in activity, there's a geometric effect on the capacity necessary to run the firm safely. While we're availing ourselves of our own recent experience with integration, as well as the expertise available to us as part of the team is joining from TD Ameritrade and we're eager to get to full synergy recognition, we of course have to balance that with the client experience considerations. We want this to be an incredibly smooth experience for all of our clients, both the retail investors and advisors and we expect to continue to serve the vast majority of them long past integration. At this point, I'll turn the mic over to Peter, and he'll give you details on how all of this works into the financial picture.\nPeter Crawford: All right. Well, thank you very much, Joe. It's certainly great to have you back here at the business update. Well, even if it is in your words, a cameo appearance. So Walt and Joe talked about the excitement we feel about the TD Ameritrade acquisition and our confidence in how it will benefit clients, stockholders and our combined team of employees. They talked about the strong momentum we continue to enjoy in the marketplace in spite of the challenging conditions in which we operate, and the progress we're making in executing on our strategy around leveraging our scale, capturing monetization opportunities to benefit clients and creating leading experiences for key segments of our client base. In my time today, I'll talk about how that momentum helped to partially offset the current challenging market environment and especially the pressure from low interest rates. I'll also share with you the operating and financial results for TD Ameritrade for the quarter ended September 30, which demonstrate that we are joining forces with a very, very healthy business, whose continued momentum in this environment leads both to stronger financial performance and an even more resilient business model. And finally, I'll provide an update on our Q4 outlook, incorporating TD Ameritrade for the first time and I'll also provide some initial thoughts on 2021. I think the overall message you'll hear is that we're clearly well-aware of the environmental challenges we face, some of which are clearly impacting our financial results. And we recognize there may be some difficult weeks and months ahead. But at the same time, we couldn't be more optimistic and more confident about the future for this company. And feel like we have crossed a bit of an inflection point, given our strong momentum in the market, our early experience and successes with TD Ameritrade acquisition and integration and finally the progress we're making both organically and via M&A around our strategic priorities. We'll talk a lot around here about focusing on what we can control. We can't control the equity markets whose recent performances has become a tailwind for us and we cannot control the interest rate environment -- clearly a very formidable headwind. But what we can control is that no trade-offs positioning that Walt talked about, which when coupled with high investor engagement have led to enormous year over year increases in new to firm retail households. And in a business built on trust, we also work really hard to maintain that trust giving our clients confidence in entrusting their assets with us, including their uninvested cash, which is up over 50% year-over-year. Given that mix of some tailwinds and some strong interest rate headwinds, it's not surprising that our revenue was down 10% year-over-year in the third quarter. This was entirely due to an 18% decline in net interest revenue. Average interest earning assets rose at remarkable 45% year-over-year, but that wasn't enough to overcome a 105 basis point reduction in our net interest margin due to Fed cuts, an increase in premium amortization and the impact of investing nearly $100 billion of new cash at rates lower than our average portfolio yield. Asset management and admin fees were up 4% year-over-year, despite the return this year of money fund waivers, which totaled $44 million in the quarter. And trading was down 12% despite a more than doubling of trading activity due of course, to last year's commission reductions. Now expenses were up roughly 6%, but that would have been only about 2% without the acquisition and integration expenses for TD Ameritrade and the incremental acquired intangible amortization related to the USA transaction, Motif and Wasmer acquisitions. And even that modest adjusted expense growth includes the ongoing expenses of those three new businesses, which together contributed a little more than two percentage points of growth. Put it all together, and we delivered a 36% pretax margin and a 39% adjusted pretax margin. A 10% return on equity and a 12% return on tangible common equity, which continues to be adversely impacted by a now $5.7 billion net unrealized gain within our available for sale portfolio. Our balance sheet continues to grow due both to our substantial organic growth and client allocation decisions. As we said previously, we typically see client cash on the balance sheet increase more quickly when interest rates are low. As clients see less benefit and utilizing purchase money funds, CDs and other fixed income instruments leaving more cash in their account and a greater portion of that cash in our bank and broker dealers sweep options. Following a huge surge in client cash at the end of the first quarter, we've seen somewhat slower but still quite robust growth and sweep cash balances during the last two quarters, including a 6% sequential increase in Q3. That balance sheet growth reduced our Tier 1 leverage ratio to 5.7% for the third quarter. While that's below our operating objective of 6.75% to 7%, it's still well above the regulatory minimum. And as I'll discuss in a moment, the TD Ameritrade acquisition is quite helpful in enabling us to rebuild our capital ratios more quickly than we would be able to do otherwise. Now the concern whenever you buy a business and have an extended timeframe between signing and close, is what is the state of that business when you finally take over? Judging by the operating and financial results for TD Ameritrade and the quarter ended September 30, it's clear we're bringing onboard a very, very healthy business and one that is performing exceptionally well in the current environment. And for that, we certainly should thank the thousands of TD Ameritrade employees who've been working so hard over the last 10 to 12 months. Now before I run through the few highlights from the TD Ameritrade seller quarter, a public service announcement or promotional announcement. As Rich noted at the outset, there are additional standalone operating and financial information for TD Ameritrade has been posted to the financial report section of Schwab's Investor Relations site. Now you can see the strong operating metrics here highlighted by a significant momentum in the market, 20% increase in net new assets, and a greater than 300% increase in net new funded accounts and positive indicators of course of investor engagement with a 355% increase in trading activity and a 23% increase in average margin balances. That's substantial business growth and higher investor engagement translated into robust financial performance. Revenue up 5% as a surgeon trading and margin balances more than offset the impact of lower interest rates. Operating expenses down 2% and operating margin above 50% and a 16% increase in earnings per share to $1.16. While both firms have been performing quite well independently, the combination creates an even more resilient and potent company. Merging our financial results for the third quarter would suggest a company with over $4 billion in revenue, a pretax margin of 45% plus and approximately $53 billion in stockholders equity. And the mix of revenue of course is different than what Schwab has experienced in the recent past. With just over 50% coming from spread-based revenue, net interest revenue and what you see on the pie chart as the BDA fees, 24% coming from asset management and admin fees, and now 21% coming from trading. Now those of you who followed the company for a long time have heard many of us, myself included, talk about our lack of reliance of trading as being a good thing. But that was when trading was facing secular headwinds in the form of ever-decreasing equity commissions. But that pricing erosion now largely off the table, the greater exposure to trading is clearly a benefit as it increases our diversification, add less capital intensive revenue streams, and create an even more all-weather business model as is being demonstrated in the current environment. Now this year has clearly unfolded differently than the way any of us anticipated several quarters ago and even relative to the scenario we share back in April. The equity markets have continued to rise much more quickly, interest rates both short and long term remain at historically low levels. Trading activity on the other hand is provided nice lift and our balance sheet growth has already surpassed the upper end of the range we've communicated. Our performance to date reflects that mix of tailwinds and one very stiff headwind. Revenue has been tracking a little bit on the lower end of the range. Despite key drivers of our workload, all increasing sharply, new accounts, trade calls, et cetera, we've managed to limit adjusted expense growth to the lower end of the range. And in doing so have produced an adjusted pretax margin just above 40% year-to-date. Of course the scenarios we share previously excluded the impact of TD Ameritrade. But with the closing now behind us we're in a position to communicate a scenario for the fourth quarter, which reflects the combination. So for the full year, we now expect year-over-year revenue growth to be positive 7.5% to 8%. Now that assumes modest market appreciation from levels of late last week earlier this week, continue to elevated trading and stabilizing prepayment speeds [ph]. It has also based off an expectation that net interest margin for the fourth quarter should be in the 150 basis point range plus or minus, but perhaps 10 basis points or more above where our average for Q3. A function of absorbing TD Ameritrade non-BDA related to interest earning assets, [indiscernible] margin book onto our balance sheet. And for those of you familiar with the way that TD Ameritrade historically report NIM, I know that our measure of NIM excludes those BDA balances. We'd anticipate full year adjusted total expense growth to be 15.5% to 16.5%. That includes roughly 4% year-over-year growth for the Schwab standalone business consistent with a scenario we discussed back in July. It also reflects the initial synergy realization that Joe described earlier in his update, but of course exclude the acquisition integration costs and as a reminder, we currently anticipate roughly 30% to 35% of the total integration spend to occur in the first 12 months post-closing. Those numbers also exclude any amortization of acquired intangibles which we expect will be roughly $445 million in the fourth quarter. So putting it all together, the scenario would result in a 25% to 35% accretion in adjusted EPS, relative to our Q3 results. Turning our attention to the balance sheet. We'd expect our balance sheet to grow by a bit over 70% driven by the addition of TD Ameritrade's $70 billion balance sheet and continued growth and client cash balances which typically see even higher flows in the fourth quarter. Now the acquisition not only is immediately and significantly additive to EPS, it's also immediately accretive to our capital ratios as well. I mentioned earlier that our Q3 Tier 1 leverage ratio is 5.7% based off of average assets and the spot ratio given the fact that the balance has grown over the quarter, based off the end of period assets was probably 10 to 15 basis points lower. But the acquisition of TD Ameritrade immediately boost that spot Tier 1 leverage ratio to nearly 6%. And the capital benefit from the acquisition extends beyond the closing date. Given our desire to keep the ratio preferred to Tier 1 capital below 25% and the absence of preferred equity and TD Ameritrade's capital stack, the acquisition creates additional preferred capacity, which we'd expect to access in the coming quarters. And by adding incremental earnings, the acquisition increases our organic capital formation as well. Despite the interest rate environment, we're feeling very excited and very confident as we look ahead to 2021. We expect the momentum that both firms have enjoyed to lay the foundation for continued success next year. And the financial benefits that we that we expect to reveal themselves in our Q4 results should continue to build as we capture more of the expense and revenue synergies. And while we'll share our scenarios for 2021 at the February business update as we always do, we hope you can appreciate the potent firm we've created here. $6 trillion in client assets, 29 million brokerage accounts, and $6.5 billion to $7 billion of adjusted pretax income, just analyzing our combined third quarter and potential fourth quarter results. And importantly with interest rates and prepayment speeds appearing to stabilize, we can see after several quarterly declines in net interest revenue the potential for sequential increases in NIR, assuming we continue to see organic growth and clients we've cashed balances consistent with recent months, as well as similar levels of margin balances. And even as we work hard to integrate TD Ameritrade as quickly and as effectively as possible, we'll also further advanced our strategies around scale, monetization and segmentation. And finally, we're ever mindful of our capital position, ensuring that we have adequate capital to support the organic growth of our balance sheet, as well as the transfers from the IDA, which can begin as early as July 1 of next year. Now let me close with a few thoughts. We have spent a lot of time discussing the acquisition of TD Ameritrade and clearly with good reason. We couldn't be more excited about what it means for this company, for our clients and for our stockholders. But while it's true that the acquisition marks the new chapter in Schwab's history, it's also only a piece of the story. We're still pushing forward aggressively on multiple other fronts that Walt described, capturing opportunities to better serve our clients, confronting our competition head on, and doubling down on our efforts to drive greater efficiency and productivity throughout our business. And while it's also true that the acquisition is transformative, increasing our scale, broadening our capabilities, it won't fundamentally change who we are or how we operate, our focus on clients, the discipline with which we manage the business, our fundamental financial formula, and our long term orientation. This is what has made us successful for over four decades and we're confident [indiscernible] successful in the next decades to come. With that, let me turn it to Rich for some questions.\nRich Fowler: All right. Thank you all. We'll go to Q&A now, Operator. Would like to start us off on how to pose questions?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. You may ask your question.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. So a lot of factors have changed since the deal was announced or you think about rates, client engagement, asset levels, things like you're reiterating the expense, synergies that you've outlined or originally outlined, but I assume some of the areas of potential revenue and/or expense reduction have changed given all given the external factors that have that have happened between announcement and close. So if you could talk about that, and ultimately, accretion from how you originally stated it to where it sits now.\nPeter Crawford: Dan, so let me take that. This is Peter. Let me take that in a couple ways. First, the near term accretion math has gotten better, frankly in the last year given the relative earnings trajectory of both TD Ameritrade and Schwab. In terms of the synergy realization, I would say that if anything, the synergy opportunity has increased. On the cost synergy side, despite the environmental changes, if you will, I don't think our thinking around the cost synergy opportunity has fundamentally shifted. We still think that those numbers are very achievable and largely are to be derived in the similar places that we had expected a year ago. On the revenue side, Joe mentioned that a large portion of the revenue synergies are coming from rebanking the balances in the IDA. Those balances at the time of the acquisition were I think roughly $115 billion. And today they're over $150 billion. So that benefits us in a couple of ways: one, as you may recall, we got a 10 basis point improvement in the net fee there. So that's now applied over a larger base of balances immediately; and then second is that more cash that we can bring onto the balance sheet and every time we do that, we're picking up incremental spread revenue as we do so. So I think that has been at the positive as well. I also think that as we've dug in and spent more time looking at the business and understanding more about the business, we see other -- other opportunities, others or maybe smaller revenue opportunities where we can -- we can leverage both firms being together to capture incremental revenue, probably more to talk about those in the future. But we -- but I would say anything, our confidence, our excitement, our enthusiasm about this is only increasing last year.\nDan Fannon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Will Nance with Goldman Sachs, you may ask your question.\nWill Nance: Hi, everyone. Good morning. Maybe I could start off with a quick question on balance sheet growth from here. If I think about pro forma for Ameritrade, and this is rough math, but it seems like the percentage of your client cash that is now on balance sheet is in kind of the 50%. ballpark, and that's kind of in the backdrop of that being below the long term average, all time low rate, loss of liquidity, money markets being kind of flat to even shrinking. So when we think about the tailwind of BDA sweeps going forward, as well as what you could call reverse sorting and the lower rate environment, do you think we could be talking about something like double digit balance sheet growth for the next couple of years, as we kind of rebase the allocation of cash between on and off balance sheet?\nRich Fowler: It sounds like repeated question,\nWalt Bettinger: That does sound like repeated question. So, Will, the two things that tend - or the three -- I guess the three dynamics that tend to drive the balance sheet growth organically, and I'll -- we'll be looking at Legacy Schwab. One is the interest rate environment and then a lower interest rate environment as I mentioned, our clients are less apt to avail themselves of the purchase money funds and CDs, there's just not as much of a yield pickup and not as much of a benefit for them to do that. So they're more likely to leave that cash sitting in their account on our balance sheet. Second, of course is organic growth, because a certain portion of the net new assets we bring every -- every quarter, every year comes in the form of cash. And then third is client relative sentiment about the equity markets, whether they are buying more equities or selling equities. Of course, that is, you know, that's harder to predict, going forward than perhaps those first two items. So, you know, you can imagine, certainly in this low interest rate environment, you can imagine, as we've seen, our balance sheet has grown at a sequence -- at a pace post the end of the first quarter, when we obviously saw that huge surge, at an annualized pace and in the double digit, you certainly can imagine a scenario where that would continue into the next -- as long as those interest rates remain low. Now, if interest rates were increased, one would expect at that pace, a balance sheet growth would -- would come down, and if clients get more bullish on the equity markets that would on the margin tend to slow the pace of balance sheet growth as well.\nWill Nance: Got it. That's very helpful. And then, secondly, kind of on the same topic, I'll keep asking few other questions. As we think about the continued growth in the securities portfolio, you've had a big opportunity over the past year or so to continue to shift the mix towards fixed rate securities and away from the floating rate allocations, just maybe looking for an update on how long that can kind of continue, when you would kind of need to start keeping that balance in line and what the rates on those sorts of securities look like in today's environments, I guess, from a credit perspective.\nWalt Bettinger: So we're at about -- we're about at 85/15 now fixed to floating on our investment portfolio. And we feel like that's probably about the -- about the right place to be. So I would say that you'd see us look to probably maintain that pretty close. That leads us to a duration in the upper threes. In terms of the rates, reinvestment rates on the fixed portion are in the 90 to 105 basis point range today, and of course that varies on a daily -- weekly if not daily basis, but sort of in that -- in that general range.\nWill Nance: That's helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Your question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America, you may ask your question.\nMike Carrier: Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. What -- it seems like you guys offer great value in many areas, and you've been innovative in the different offerings. But one of the things you mentioned is kind of on the higher wall side, the RIAs, and when you think about the more holistic and full service types of offerings, how do you think about Schwab offering you say lending, insurance, or other offerings that can be increasingly in demand meaning, you think about that on a proprietary basis, third parties, but wanted to get your thoughts there?\nWalt Bettinger: You're referring on the retail side or on the RIA side or both?\nMike Carrier : Yeah, both, but I would say probably you're going to see more demand through the RIAs.\nWalt Bettinger: Yeah. So we -- we certainly see growth on both sides. Of course, the RIA business continues to have exceptional organic growth. But also on the retail side, as I mentioned, the fastest growing segment of clients for us is high net worth and ultra high net worth clients. Now, they tend to be a little bit of a different kind of client, if you were trying to categorize them, in that the ones who come to us on the retail side tend to maybe be a bit more self-directed, maybe -- they come from the financial world and they're accustomed to managing money or managing their own money whereas on the RIA side, they tend to be more of relying on a professional investment advisor to help them manage their money. But both are growing fairly rapidly. And our plan is to continue to add the services and capabilities that the high net worth and ultra high net worth investor wants even with, again, the different approach to managing money that generally occurs on the retail side and RIA side. Segment services, dedicated relationship capabilities, access to the type of products that both of those types of high net worth and ultra high net worth investors want. Interestingly enough, when we talk to the ones on the retail side, they made a specific decision to come to Schwab. And they would like to stay at Schwab and consolidate assets at Schwab. But we have to make sure that we can deliver for them the type of service experience that they expect, given their significant level of asset. So we will continue to expand those capabilities to meet their needs, the retails ones that are at Schwab, because they want to be at Schwab. The ones served by RIAs are there because that's the best fit for them.\nMike Carrier: Great. Okay. And then, Peter, just one clarification. I think that you mentioned that the NIM for the fourth quarter around the 150, and I don't know if you had to break out between Schwab and Ameritrade and not looking for that going forward, but just given the moving pieces this quarter. I don't know if you can provide some context, you know, on the moving pieces. Thanks.\nPeter Crawford: Yeah, so we did on that page, you'll see the incremental benefit on NIM of the TD Ameritrade acquisition. I think we said it's [indiscernible] 19 basis points. So I would imply kind of low 130s for the legacy Schwab business. Again, that's a -- that's a function -- if you look -- if you -- if you think back to the factors that have impacted NIM over the last couple of quarters, it's been the declining short term rates, it's been an increase in premium and amortization. It's been declining credit spreads, and then it's been a huge, huge increase in cash balances that we've reinvested at rates that are lower than our average portfolio yield. Those credit spreads have largely stabilized, short term rates of course have stabilized, less -- right now there's less cash to invest in the spread on between -- the difference between the rates we're investing at versus what were the average portfolio yield that -- that delta has come down. And we wouldn't expect from here a further big step increase in premium amortization. So we think that NIM while it may come down from Q3 to Q4, it seems unlikely to be as big, again, I'm just talking about the legacy Schwab business, not likely to be nearly as big as what it was from Q2 to Q3.\nMike Carrier: That makes sense. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe research. You may ask your question.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good morning. So I wanted to start with a question just on the election impact. There's some speculation that blue wave could drive steeper yield curve, which will certainly be beneficial, but also could come with the cost of either increase in tax rates and tougher regulation, whether it's DOL, transaction tax, higher capital requirements for banks, which will clearly present some headwinds. And I was hoping you can just provide some perspective on how you're thinking about the different election scenarios and what the potential implications could be?\nRich Fowler: Okay, maybe, Walt would you like to start us off on that? And then maybe Peter can pick up after?\nWalt Bettinger: Sure. I think -- I think most of our emphasis right now is on making sure that we're here for our clients during -- during what could prove to be a volatile election period. It's -- I would say that our capability to speculate on the outcome of this election is no better than anyone else's, and, so I don't think we are planning on strategic changes at this point in time. I think all the things that you mentioned, are accurate if in fact, you get the outcome for the election that you referenced. And we would at that point in time have to figure out how the interplay between a steeper yield curve as well as some of the less favorable things for our business that you mentioned, if they end up occurring. But right now all the emphasis is really around making sure that we have system availability, capacity, service for our clients, as we go into a period that could be very volatile. And it may be an extended period before we know the outcome of the election, at least, for some offices. Peter, I don't know if you have anything you want to add to that? \nPeter Crawford: I think you answered it well, Walt. I'll just say that I think we have shown our ability to prosper in different environments and different administrations over our 40-something years. And as long as we continue to focus on clients, folks at home can do the math on what changes in corporate tax rates might do or changes in the long end of the curve. That's not really any mystery. But for the long term and the way that we manage this business, it's as Walt says, it's really continuing to focus on our clients, continue to execute on our strategy. And we think we will benefit from a lot of the secular trends that are taking shape in our industry. And so we think that'll continue to benefit us, regardless of the administration in the political environment. \nSteven Chubak: Thank you both for that perspective. And just for my follow up, I wanted to ask on capital. Following the deal use or at least with the completion of the deal you spoke to the capital accretion, Peter, and the additional preferred capacity getting you back well above 6%, but just given your target of 6.75% to 7% coupled with the fact that you continue to see really strong organic cash growth, it looks like by the time you can onboard the BDA in July of next year, that you're still going to be below that target level and was hoping you could speak to how you're managing to those capital constraints, how it might impact the decision making to onboard the BDA as quickly and how you're just balancing that pace with a commensurate capital drags? \nPeter Crawford: Yes certainly our intention is to onbring those balances onto our balance sheet, starting in July 1 of next year. We do have various levers at our disposal around capital, we want to make sure we have enough capital to support the organic growth of our balance sheet. I think that's why I think it's reasonable to expect us to access the periphery markets. But I don't think you should assume that if we're not at, , let's say 6.75% and tier one leverage in July 1 of next year, that means we're not going to bring on those balances. We certainly could do that, even if we're short of -- we certainly expect we could do that if we're short of that level.\nSteven Chubak: Thanks for clarifying that Peter, much appreciated.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank, you may ask your question.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Let me just start with the interest rate, headwind dynamic. Peter, you mentioned the 90 to 105 basis points, fixed reinvestment rates, maybe you could share the floating reinvestment rates if you continue to keep that at 15%. And then any commentary on money market fee waivers into 4Q, given the exit run rate was higher than the entry run rate and tricky.\nPeter Crawford: So on the money find fee waivers, it wouldn't surprise us to see a little -- a bit of a pickup between Q3 and Q4, as you said, we're exiting a little bit of a higher pace. Of course, it depends on how much -- what the balances are in money fund. And as we continue to see balances, the balances into most purchase money funds go down. That would obviously reduce the amount of fee waivers. But I think an increase between Q3 and Q4 is reasonably expected. That's based -- that's built into that full year revenue outlook that we provided earlier. In terms of floating rate yields, it's somewhere to say it's in the 40 somewhere in that range right now. For what we're buying, of course that depends on whether it's -- a lot of the credit that we tend to purchase is floating rate and so the yields there tend to be a lot higher, of course, than when we're buying some agencies. So we're doing a pretty wide spread there.\nBrian Bedell: Okay, got it. And then a question for Walt. Longer term on the interest rate dynamic, if we are in a lower rate environment for much longer than anyone thinks, what are your thoughts on globally migrating the revenue mix away from interest rate sensitive types of areas? And how would you -- how are you thinking it's possible to build those more sustainable fee revenue areas and maybe that weaves into some of the revenue synergies that I'm sure we'll talk about more in February? But how are you thinking about trying to change that mix, if at all?\nWalt Bettinger: I think we do have a longer term goal of striving for a balance between spread income and other forms of revenue. And of course, that plays out in two of our three strategic initiatives, very clearly in monetization and segmentation. And the thing that I would just emphasize is that all of our monetization efforts are -- we want to ensure are done in terms of them being good for clients. But you can see them unfolding before you whether it's the acquisition of the technology and the talent from Motif, the acquisition of Wasmer, Schroeder, the negotiations that we are having with firms, who effectively capitalize on our platform and we provide services that they would otherwise have to provide, but yet don't provide any offsetting compensation for those services. These are all in line with actions that we're taking as well as continue to build our advisory solution. But again, the overriding in all of those moves will be to ensure that anything we do is the right thing for our clients. But we are confident that we can drive toward a more balanced scenario in the world you described, where rates stay lower for longer. Of course, if rates do turn and go up with the yield curve steepens, our spread income can increase quite dramatically, quite quickly. And of course, that would make it more challenging. But we're fairly confident in our plans to get to a more balanced approach within a reasonable period of time and are taking all prudent actions to get there. \nBrian Bedell: Okay, thanks for your color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities, you may ask your question.\nDevin Ryan: Great. Good morning. First question here just on expenses. And I know we're going to find our point on this. But if we think beyond the immediate $250 million to $300 million synergies here, if you can just help us maybe bridge a bit to the to $1.8 billion to $2 billion, and just remind us of some of the key milestones that are going to be required to hit those types of levels. And just also, if you can, whether you're feeling the same around the timing here because obviously, the range is the same, but a lot has changed. It was previously stated to just try to think about the timing of expense synergies relative to what you guys were thinking when the deal was announced. \nJoseph Martinetto: Sure, this is Joe again. So I'd say there's very little that's changed in our thinking around how to recognize the synergies and clearly the company's continued to operate and to the extent that we've had some very active service level requirements and those kinds of things this year, both companies have added some staff to take advantage of that. But those kinds of changes haven't had a material impact on the way we've been thinking about actually achieving the synergies. So the first pass through was dominantly focused on senior and executive level management and branches. Over the nearer term, there will be a series of other functions as we look to continue to consolidate predominantly in headquarters types of roles, as you get through things like converting to a single HR platform, there's savings both on the technology and on the people side that they come with those kinds of activities. And those will occur over the course of the next couple of years. A little further out is when you actually get another opportunity to get a bigger bang and expense synergies when you get to that point or we get to that point of being able to do the account conversion. There are a lot of synergies tied up in moving to a single broker dealer from two broker dealers. And there's a material amount of reduction, summon staff to support for a lot across things like technology platforms, real estate footprint that come down once we get to the place where we can really get to a single broker-dealer and run on a single platform. Then I would say there's a little bit of cleanup that goes on past that big bang date as we move to full retirement of some of those platforms and systems and just the cleanup work that doesn't come immediately upon conversion. You get a couple of big events in there that will drive some bigger reductions so we do expect over the course of the next 36 months that you will see continuous recognition of synergies over time, maybe not completely evenly over that window but you should see.\nDevin Ryan: [Technical Difficulty] through some of the account growth metrics and just terrific momentum here in the business. I'm curious, just with the deal closing, whether there's been any change in trajectory within either business in the retail side or institutional side. Also just with the RA custody, whether or I guess more what you're telling advisors, especially your advisors that have assets and accounts custody on both platforms, and just some curious kind of whether it's just business as usual, or if there's anything else that's going to change just with the deal formally closing here.\nWalt Bettinger: Thanks, I'll step in there on that one. I think we've seen business as usual with maybe one adjustment, and that is that there are a number of TD Ameritrade service advisors who would like to go ahead and make this switch over to the Schwab platform at this point in time rather than wait for us to do that as part of the integration. But the notion that there is some significant movement, if you're getting it that of RA's unhappy with the combination and therefore making moves elsewhere is simply not being backed up by the facts. If they were they would have shown up in the TOA metrics that I shared with you. So that was part of why I showed you those numbers. The clients are excited. They know that we are committed to ending up with a winning platform for them that integrates the best of Schwab and the best of Ameritrade as Bernie Clarke likes to say that it's not going to be one platform or another winning, it's going to be a new platform that combines the best of all. The RA that we talk with are really excited about being a part of that, being part of an organization with our scale and size, the ability to help them grow and as well as protect their clients' assets. So it's been all business as usual to positive if I were to try to summarize it.\nDevin Ryan: Okay, terrific. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Chris Sadler with William Blair. You may ask your question.\nChris Sadler: Good morning. Any early update on the revenue synergies which you would outline particularly payment for overflow? I'm sure you've had a chance to kind of at least get an early look at the extent to which Ameritrade's greater order routing revenues due to product mix technology or just different philosophies.\nJoe Martinetto : I'd say that's one of those areas where we weren't able to get into a lot of detail prior to close for competitive purposes. So we are parsing that data today. If anything, I'd say we probably feel a little bit more optimistic about our ability to maintain the majority of that revenue than we did prior to close. But it's still a little early for us to get into a lot of detail on exactly how that's going to play out.\nChris Sadler: Okay, thanks, Joe. Then just one other one on the pricing landscape or marketing landscape. Well, you noted a few quarters ago that you had seen some increased competition around some of the offers that some larger banks were offering to try to drive client acquisition. Just any update on that front will be great.\nWalt Bettinger: Sure. It remains a highly competitive market and there is some activity around paying cash in order to get balances so that is still an activity that exists and continues to be an activity that we have questions about its long term logic for companies that intend to be independent and staying in the market over time. I would just say that I guess I would add, I remain optimistic that rational business leadership moves to rational and economically rational decision making over time.\nChris Sadler: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. You may ask your question.\nBrennan Hawken: Hey, good afternoon now, I guess. Thanks for taking my question. At least good afternoon on the east coast. So it seems as though near term accretion from the deal is better but it didn't sound like you were changing the long term. In fact, it sounded like from an expense perspective, you specifically didn't change the long term. But is it right for us to assume that the experience that you're having here in the early days is clickable and that the better than expected accretion off the bat, therefore, would also translate into better accretion in total? Or is it just that things are happening maybe a little sooner than expected and it's just timing? Sorry, if you touched on it, that just wasn't completely clear to me.\nPeter Crawford: I'll try to answer that and maybe Joe would be ready to add on to that. I guess, I would say is we are very, very excited about this deal. We're excited about this deal from an accretion standpoint. But I think even more importantly than that, we're excited about this deal, what this means for us long term, and our ability, or the position we have in the market, and the way that we can serve clients. Certainly, the math is compelling again, in the near term because of the accretion and over the longer term because of the revenue and expense synergies that Joe has talked about and I've talked about on previous calls. I think those numbers have on the revenue side, as I mentioned, have gotten bigger on the cost side probably similar, but it's really nothing to suggest they've gotten any smaller, and maybe over time, perhaps we'll discover more there. But I think also one of the things we've discovered is just the compatibility between the two organizations and over the last several months and bringing these two teams together and the alignment that we have around our focus on clients and that cultural compatibility is so very, very important on a complex integration like this. So that's also made us very, very enthusiastic and excited about the future as well. So I think on every dimension, we're feeling very, very enthusiastic about the acquisition.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse, you may ask your question.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you hope you're all doing well. Just following your June acquisition of motif, we wanted to see if we get an update on the timing behind it direct indexing launch and also, do you have plans to launch the capability first to the RAA channel or potentially both to return advisors at the same time?\nWalt Bettinger: Craig, I'll take that. Unfortunately, this is going to be one of those questions. So I'll just say upfront, I'm not going to answer to your satisfaction. We're not going to discuss timing on the introduction for competitive reasons nor are we going to discuss which organizations might go first, but we certainly have every intention of making it available to both. That'll be used slightly differently by retail and by the RAA and so the determinant will be not trying to benefit one segment of our business over another, it'll just be which one we can get it to quicker because of the way they'll utilize the product.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.\nChris Harris: Just a couple of clarifying questions on the synergies. Should we be assuming the account conversion is a year to event? Then the $250 million to $300 million you guys are unveiling today, are those going to be realized very quickly, like in a few months or is that more of a gradual thing to be realized to the year?\nPeter Crawford: Is it $250 million to $300 million we talked about today or already accomplished? They will show up in the run rate beginning in Q4. A little bit of timing there and that some of the staff reductions here have happened through October, but they will start to show in Q4 before embedded in Q1, those are done and executed on. And we're not, at this point, providing target dates for account conversion, but you start thinking to some of the other comments here around the 18 to 36 months and you got to get the accounts conversion in that window, with the time to be able to do some of the clean-up at the back end, to be able to get to the full synergy number. Then you can start to back into what some of our thinking is probably around the conversion date.\nChris Harris : Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. You may ask your question.\nKyle Voigt : Hi, thank you. Wondering if you can give us an update on the strategy around pricing at clearing conversion? And specifically, I think Joe mentioned that there will be some revenue synergies realized at the conversion date. I just want to get some more details on those. And then secondly, I'm wondering whether Ameritrade margin book [ph] which is much higher yielding right now, will that migrate towards Schwab's blended rate after conversion? Or will pricing be maintained for that book thereafter? Thank you.\nJoe Martinetto: So my guess is, we will be in a position at that winter business update to write more details on all of these components. From a revenue perspective, I would echo some of Peter's earlier comments to say that we were pretty enthusiastic about what we're finding. And today thinking through some of the pricing and recognition, implications of decisions that we're going to have to face around how we bring these organizations together. But I would say, we're feeling optimistic about what we're seeing and what some of the recognition opportunities might look like. As you look forward to post conversion, I'd say that a couple of big buckets that we're going to have to dimensionalize here are around being able to provide some of the better trading opportunity in the systems, the TD Ameritrade has built to the Schwab client base, as well as being able to provide some of the more extensive wealth management capabilities the Schwab has built, as the TD Ameritrade existing client base. And if I had to guess a little bit today, I would say, we might see those trading benefits happen a little bit faster than wealth management. Wealth management has to be more of a relationship-type activity that we expect to build over time. We do think that those opportunities are significant, that may take a little longer recognize post conversion.\nKyle Voigt : That's great color. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And this question comes from Michael Cypryss with Morgan Stanley, you may ask your question.\nMichael Cypryss : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I was just hoping for a little bit more color on the net new assets and new customers that are coming over to Schwab here. What portion would you say are new households coming over to Schwab for the first time, versus a wallet share from existing customers? And then, for those new customers that are coming in the door, where would you say they're coming from? And as others are also reporting growth and seeing growth in accounts and customers, how do you think about the profile and where those customers are coming from and the profile of them? Thank you.\nJoe Martinetto: Walt, do you want to start us off on new customers?\nWalt Bettinger: Sure. So there's no question there are new entrants into the space. And that is leading to some of the new household formation, it's probably why we tried to share both net new assets figures, which of course, are a very broad definition, right? That net number is made up of new-to-firm households, as well as existing clients, as well as transfers from other financial services or investment services providers. So I don't know that we historically want to break down the components of that net new assets, but we try to give you enough metrics to give you a solid understanding. We report the total net new assets. We give you the new-to-firm household growth, which I think was on one of the pages that Peter shared. And of course, we give you the transfer numbers, which gives you an idea of whether we are winning or losing on a net basis relative to competitors with existing clients who may be residing at Schwab and residing at our competitor. I think we're having success with all three of those, as evidenced by our net new assets, including the record September, and the TOA numbers speak for themselves.\nMichael Cypryss: And just maybe a follow up on the lending side, just hoping you could just give a little bit more color around some of the initiatives there, and how meaningful could this be as you look out over the next couple of years? On the lending side, more pledged asset lines among other lending products that you have, that you're prioritizing or even thinking about bringing to the marketplace?\nJoe Martinetto: Peter, do you want to draw to that, and then you can close this out?\nPeter Crawford: Yes, I can take that. We're quite pleased with the momentum we have on the lending side, if you look at -- I think our overall bank loans are up 30% year over year. Of course, that's during obviously a refinancing wave. But with our investor advantage pricing, that has been a huge win with our clients and our client-facing employees and just exceptional, exceptional pricing, while still offering an attractive economic benefit to us and helping us to cement those relationships with our key clients. Some of them was other firms that would like to do business with them at bay. I think there's certainly more opportunity there. And there's also more opportunity with the pledged asset line and having greater penetration there. If you look at where we are with pals [ph], we're certainly underpenetrated relative to what you see at the wirehouse firms. And I would say that's true both of our legacy Schwab clients and even more true with the TD Ameritrade clients, and the opportunity there is very, very fertile. So we're very, very excited, very enthusiastic about our ability to continue to grow that in a way that is very consistent with our strategy. I think we're out a time and I just thought I should just close with that. And just thank all of you for your questions today. I just want to close with a couple of thoughts and really reinforce something Walt said earlier, clearly we know that interest rates move in cycles, and this low rate environment will end at some point in the future. And we'll see the return to more normalized rates. But we're certainly not just waiting around for that to happen. And I'll say, while we're quite pleased by the near-term EPS benefit, and the acquisition supports that 25% to 35% number I referenced earlier. It's really the long term prospects that make us even more excited. And that's why we're really pressing ahead very, very aggressively, but in a way that's entirely consistent with our strategy, our purpose and our DNA. As those actions begin to bear fruit, in some cases quickly and other cases more gradually over time, it just reinforces our confidence and our enthusiasm. We'll look forward to seeing all of you virtually most likely, possibly some in person at the February business update. Stay safe everyone and thank you for your time today.\nOperator: Thank you, that does conclude today's call.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Crawford",
            "content": "All right. Well, thank you very much, Joe. It's certainly great to have you back here at the business update. Well, even if it is in your words, a cameo appearance. So Walt and Joe talked about the excitement we feel about the TD Ameritrade acquisition and our confidence in how it will benefit clients, stockholders and our combined team of employees. They talked about the strong momentum we continue to enjoy in the marketplace in spite of the challenging conditions in which we operate, and the progress we're making in executing on our strategy around leveraging our scale, capturing monetization opportunities to benefit clients and creating leading experiences for key segments of our client base. In my time today, I'll talk about how that momentum helped to partially offset the current challenging market environment and especially the pressure from low interest rates. I'll also share with you the operating and financial results for TD Ameritrade for the quarter ended September 30, which demonstrate that we are joining forces with a very, very healthy business, whose continued momentum in this environment leads both to stronger financial performance and an even more resilient business model. And finally, I'll provide an update on our Q4 outlook, incorporating TD Ameritrade for the first time and I'll also provide some initial thoughts on 2021. I think the overall message you'll hear is that we're clearly well-aware of the environmental challenges we face, some of which are clearly impacting our financial results. And we recognize there may be some difficult weeks and months ahead. But at the same time, we couldn't be more optimistic and more confident about the future for this company. And feel like we have crossed a bit of an inflection point, given our strong momentum in the market, our early experience and successes with TD Ameritrade acquisition and integration and finally the progress we're making both organically and via M&A around our strategic priorities. We'll talk a lot around here about focusing on what we can control. We can't control the equity markets whose recent performances has become a tailwind for us and we cannot control the interest rate environment -- clearly a very formidable headwind. But what we can control is that no trade-offs positioning that Walt talked about, which when coupled with high investor engagement have led to enormous year over year increases in new to firm retail households. And in a business built on trust, we also work really hard to maintain that trust giving our clients confidence in entrusting their assets with us, including their uninvested cash, which is up over 50% year-over-year. Given that mix of some tailwinds and some strong interest rate headwinds, it's not surprising that our revenue was down 10% year-over-year in the third quarter. This was entirely due to an 18% decline in net interest revenue. Average interest earning assets rose at remarkable 45% year-over-year, but that wasn't enough to overcome a 105 basis point reduction in our net interest margin due to Fed cuts, an increase in premium amortization and the impact of investing nearly $100 billion of new cash at rates lower than our average portfolio yield. Asset management and admin fees were up 4% year-over-year, despite the return this year of money fund waivers, which totaled $44 million in the quarter. And trading was down 12% despite a more than doubling of trading activity due of course, to last year's commission reductions. Now expenses were up roughly 6%, but that would have been only about 2% without the acquisition and integration expenses for TD Ameritrade and the incremental acquired intangible amortization related to the USA transaction, Motif and Wasmer acquisitions. And even that modest adjusted expense growth includes the ongoing expenses of those three new businesses, which together contributed a little more than two percentage points of growth. Put it all together, and we delivered a 36% pretax margin and a 39% adjusted pretax margin. A 10% return on equity and a 12% return on tangible common equity, which continues to be adversely impacted by a now $5.7 billion net unrealized gain within our available for sale portfolio. Our balance sheet continues to grow due both to our substantial organic growth and client allocation decisions. As we said previously, we typically see client cash on the balance sheet increase more quickly when interest rates are low. As clients see less benefit and utilizing purchase money funds, CDs and other fixed income instruments leaving more cash in their account and a greater portion of that cash in our bank and broker dealers sweep options. Following a huge surge in client cash at the end of the first quarter, we've seen somewhat slower but still quite robust growth and sweep cash balances during the last two quarters, including a 6% sequential increase in Q3. That balance sheet growth reduced our Tier 1 leverage ratio to 5.7% for the third quarter. While that's below our operating objective of 6.75% to 7%, it's still well above the regulatory minimum. And as I'll discuss in a moment, the TD Ameritrade acquisition is quite helpful in enabling us to rebuild our capital ratios more quickly than we would be able to do otherwise. Now the concern whenever you buy a business and have an extended timeframe between signing and close, is what is the state of that business when you finally take over? Judging by the operating and financial results for TD Ameritrade and the quarter ended September 30, it's clear we're bringing onboard a very, very healthy business and one that is performing exceptionally well in the current environment. And for that, we certainly should thank the thousands of TD Ameritrade employees who've been working so hard over the last 10 to 12 months. Now before I run through the few highlights from the TD Ameritrade seller quarter, a public service announcement or promotional announcement. As Rich noted at the outset, there are additional standalone operating and financial information for TD Ameritrade has been posted to the financial report section of Schwab's Investor Relations site. Now you can see the strong operating metrics here highlighted by a significant momentum in the market, 20% increase in net new assets, and a greater than 300% increase in net new funded accounts and positive indicators of course of investor engagement with a 355% increase in trading activity and a 23% increase in average margin balances. That's substantial business growth and higher investor engagement translated into robust financial performance. Revenue up 5% as a surgeon trading and margin balances more than offset the impact of lower interest rates. Operating expenses down 2% and operating margin above 50% and a 16% increase in earnings per share to $1.16. While both firms have been performing quite well independently, the combination creates an even more resilient and potent company. Merging our financial results for the third quarter would suggest a company with over $4 billion in revenue, a pretax margin of 45% plus and approximately $53 billion in stockholders equity. And the mix of revenue of course is different than what Schwab has experienced in the recent past. With just over 50% coming from spread-based revenue, net interest revenue and what you see on the pie chart as the BDA fees, 24% coming from asset management and admin fees, and now 21% coming from trading. Now those of you who followed the company for a long time have heard many of us, myself included, talk about our lack of reliance of trading as being a good thing. But that was when trading was facing secular headwinds in the form of ever-decreasing equity commissions. But that pricing erosion now largely off the table, the greater exposure to trading is clearly a benefit as it increases our diversification, add less capital intensive revenue streams, and create an even more all-weather business model as is being demonstrated in the current environment. Now this year has clearly unfolded differently than the way any of us anticipated several quarters ago and even relative to the scenario we share back in April. The equity markets have continued to rise much more quickly, interest rates both short and long term remain at historically low levels. Trading activity on the other hand is provided nice lift and our balance sheet growth has already surpassed the upper end of the range we've communicated. Our performance to date reflects that mix of tailwinds and one very stiff headwind. Revenue has been tracking a little bit on the lower end of the range. Despite key drivers of our workload, all increasing sharply, new accounts, trade calls, et cetera, we've managed to limit adjusted expense growth to the lower end of the range. And in doing so have produced an adjusted pretax margin just above 40% year-to-date. Of course the scenarios we share previously excluded the impact of TD Ameritrade. But with the closing now behind us we're in a position to communicate a scenario for the fourth quarter, which reflects the combination. So for the full year, we now expect year-over-year revenue growth to be positive 7.5% to 8%. Now that assumes modest market appreciation from levels of late last week earlier this week, continue to elevated trading and stabilizing prepayment speeds [ph]. It has also based off an expectation that net interest margin for the fourth quarter should be in the 150 basis point range plus or minus, but perhaps 10 basis points or more above where our average for Q3. A function of absorbing TD Ameritrade non-BDA related to interest earning assets, [indiscernible] margin book onto our balance sheet. And for those of you familiar with the way that TD Ameritrade historically report NIM, I know that our measure of NIM excludes those BDA balances. We'd anticipate full year adjusted total expense growth to be 15.5% to 16.5%. That includes roughly 4% year-over-year growth for the Schwab standalone business consistent with a scenario we discussed back in July. It also reflects the initial synergy realization that Joe described earlier in his update, but of course exclude the acquisition integration costs and as a reminder, we currently anticipate roughly 30% to 35% of the total integration spend to occur in the first 12 months post-closing. Those numbers also exclude any amortization of acquired intangibles which we expect will be roughly $445 million in the fourth quarter. So putting it all together, the scenario would result in a 25% to 35% accretion in adjusted EPS, relative to our Q3 results. Turning our attention to the balance sheet. We'd expect our balance sheet to grow by a bit over 70% driven by the addition of TD Ameritrade's $70 billion balance sheet and continued growth and client cash balances which typically see even higher flows in the fourth quarter. Now the acquisition not only is immediately and significantly additive to EPS, it's also immediately accretive to our capital ratios as well. I mentioned earlier that our Q3 Tier 1 leverage ratio is 5.7% based off of average assets and the spot ratio given the fact that the balance has grown over the quarter, based off the end of period assets was probably 10 to 15 basis points lower. But the acquisition of TD Ameritrade immediately boost that spot Tier 1 leverage ratio to nearly 6%. And the capital benefit from the acquisition extends beyond the closing date. Given our desire to keep the ratio preferred to Tier 1 capital below 25% and the absence of preferred equity and TD Ameritrade's capital stack, the acquisition creates additional preferred capacity, which we'd expect to access in the coming quarters. And by adding incremental earnings, the acquisition increases our organic capital formation as well. Despite the interest rate environment, we're feeling very excited and very confident as we look ahead to 2021. We expect the momentum that both firms have enjoyed to lay the foundation for continued success next year. And the financial benefits that we that we expect to reveal themselves in our Q4 results should continue to build as we capture more of the expense and revenue synergies. And while we'll share our scenarios for 2021 at the February business update as we always do, we hope you can appreciate the potent firm we've created here. $6 trillion in client assets, 29 million brokerage accounts, and $6.5 billion to $7 billion of adjusted pretax income, just analyzing our combined third quarter and potential fourth quarter results. And importantly with interest rates and prepayment speeds appearing to stabilize, we can see after several quarterly declines in net interest revenue the potential for sequential increases in NIR, assuming we continue to see organic growth and clients we've cashed balances consistent with recent months, as well as similar levels of margin balances. And even as we work hard to integrate TD Ameritrade as quickly and as effectively as possible, we'll also further advanced our strategies around scale, monetization and segmentation. And finally, we're ever mindful of our capital position, ensuring that we have adequate capital to support the organic growth of our balance sheet, as well as the transfers from the IDA, which can begin as early as July 1 of next year. Now let me close with a few thoughts. We have spent a lot of time discussing the acquisition of TD Ameritrade and clearly with good reason. We couldn't be more excited about what it means for this company, for our clients and for our stockholders. But while it's true that the acquisition marks the new chapter in Schwab's history, it's also only a piece of the story. We're still pushing forward aggressively on multiple other fronts that Walt described, capturing opportunities to better serve our clients, confronting our competition head on, and doubling down on our efforts to drive greater efficiency and productivity throughout our business. And while it's also true that the acquisition is transformative, increasing our scale, broadening our capabilities, it won't fundamentally change who we are or how we operate, our focus on clients, the discipline with which we manage the business, our fundamental financial formula, and our long term orientation. This is what has made us successful for over four decades and we're confident [indiscernible] successful in the next decades to come. With that, let me turn it to Rich for some questions. Dan, so let me take that. This is Peter. Let me take that in a couple ways. First, the near term accretion math has gotten better, frankly in the last year given the relative earnings trajectory of both TD Ameritrade and Schwab. In terms of the synergy realization, I would say that if anything, the synergy opportunity has increased. On the cost synergy side, despite the environmental changes, if you will, I don't think our thinking around the cost synergy opportunity has fundamentally shifted. We still think that those numbers are very achievable and largely are to be derived in the similar places that we had expected a year ago. On the revenue side, Joe mentioned that a large portion of the revenue synergies are coming from rebanking the balances in the IDA. Those balances at the time of the acquisition were I think roughly $115 billion. And today they're over $150 billion. So that benefits us in a couple of ways: one, as you may recall, we got a 10 basis point improvement in the net fee there. So that's now applied over a larger base of balances immediately; and then second is that more cash that we can bring onto the balance sheet and every time we do that, we're picking up incremental spread revenue as we do so. So I think that has been at the positive as well. I also think that as we've dug in and spent more time looking at the business and understanding more about the business, we see other -- other opportunities, others or maybe smaller revenue opportunities where we can -- we can leverage both firms being together to capture incremental revenue, probably more to talk about those in the future. But we -- but I would say anything, our confidence, our excitement, our enthusiasm about this is only increasing last year. Yeah, so we did on that page, you'll see the incremental benefit on NIM of the TD Ameritrade acquisition. I think we said it's [indiscernible] 19 basis points. So I would imply kind of low 130s for the legacy Schwab business. Again, that's a -- that's a function -- if you look -- if you -- if you think back to the factors that have impacted NIM over the last couple of quarters, it's been the declining short term rates, it's been an increase in premium and amortization. It's been declining credit spreads, and then it's been a huge, huge increase in cash balances that we've reinvested at rates that are lower than our average portfolio yield. Those credit spreads have largely stabilized, short term rates of course have stabilized, less -- right now there's less cash to invest in the spread on between -- the difference between the rates we're investing at versus what were the average portfolio yield that -- that delta has come down. And we wouldn't expect from here a further big step increase in premium amortization. So we think that NIM while it may come down from Q3 to Q4, it seems unlikely to be as big, again, I'm just talking about the legacy Schwab business, not likely to be nearly as big as what it was from Q2 to Q3. I think you answered it well, Walt. I'll just say that I think we have shown our ability to prosper in different environments and different administrations over our 40-something years. And as long as we continue to focus on clients, folks at home can do the math on what changes in corporate tax rates might do or changes in the long end of the curve. That's not really any mystery. But for the long term and the way that we manage this business, it's as Walt says, it's really continuing to focus on our clients, continue to execute on our strategy. And we think we will benefit from a lot of the secular trends that are taking shape in our industry. And so we think that'll continue to benefit us, regardless of the administration in the political environment. Yes certainly our intention is to onbring those balances onto our balance sheet, starting in July 1 of next year. We do have various levers at our disposal around capital, we want to make sure we have enough capital to support the organic growth of our balance sheet. I think that's why I think it's reasonable to expect us to access the periphery markets. But I don't think you should assume that if we're not at, , let's say 6.75% and tier one leverage in July 1 of next year, that means we're not going to bring on those balances. We certainly could do that, even if we're short of -- we certainly expect we could do that if we're short of that level. So on the money find fee waivers, it wouldn't surprise us to see a little -- a bit of a pickup between Q3 and Q4, as you said, we're exiting a little bit of a higher pace. Of course, it depends on how much -- what the balances are in money fund. And as we continue to see balances, the balances into most purchase money funds go down. That would obviously reduce the amount of fee waivers. But I think an increase between Q3 and Q4 is reasonably expected. That's based -- that's built into that full year revenue outlook that we provided earlier. In terms of floating rate yields, it's somewhere to say it's in the 40 somewhere in that range right now. For what we're buying, of course that depends on whether it's -- a lot of the credit that we tend to purchase is floating rate and so the yields there tend to be a lot higher, of course, than when we're buying some agencies. So we're doing a pretty wide spread there. I'll try to answer that and maybe Joe would be ready to add on to that. I guess, I would say is we are very, very excited about this deal. We're excited about this deal from an accretion standpoint. But I think even more importantly than that, we're excited about this deal, what this means for us long term, and our ability, or the position we have in the market, and the way that we can serve clients. Certainly, the math is compelling again, in the near term because of the accretion and over the longer term because of the revenue and expense synergies that Joe has talked about and I've talked about on previous calls. I think those numbers have on the revenue side, as I mentioned, have gotten bigger on the cost side probably similar, but it's really nothing to suggest they've gotten any smaller, and maybe over time, perhaps we'll discover more there. But I think also one of the things we've discovered is just the compatibility between the two organizations and over the last several months and bringing these two teams together and the alignment that we have around our focus on clients and that cultural compatibility is so very, very important on a complex integration like this. So that's also made us very, very enthusiastic and excited about the future as well. So I think on every dimension, we're feeling very, very enthusiastic about the acquisition. Is it $250 million to $300 million we talked about today or already accomplished? They will show up in the run rate beginning in Q4. A little bit of timing there and that some of the staff reductions here have happened through October, but they will start to show in Q4 before embedded in Q1, those are done and executed on. And we're not, at this point, providing target dates for account conversion, but you start thinking to some of the other comments here around the 18 to 36 months and you got to get the accounts conversion in that window, with the time to be able to do some of the clean-up at the back end, to be able to get to the full synergy number. Then you can start to back into what some of our thinking is probably around the conversion date. Yes, I can take that. We're quite pleased with the momentum we have on the lending side, if you look at -- I think our overall bank loans are up 30% year over year. Of course, that's during obviously a refinancing wave. But with our investor advantage pricing, that has been a huge win with our clients and our client-facing employees and just exceptional, exceptional pricing, while still offering an attractive economic benefit to us and helping us to cement those relationships with our key clients. Some of them was other firms that would like to do business with them at bay. I think there's certainly more opportunity there. And there's also more opportunity with the pledged asset line and having greater penetration there. If you look at where we are with pals [ph], we're certainly underpenetrated relative to what you see at the wirehouse firms. And I would say that's true both of our legacy Schwab clients and even more true with the TD Ameritrade clients, and the opportunity there is very, very fertile. So we're very, very excited, very enthusiastic about our ability to continue to grow that in a way that is very consistent with our strategy. I think we're out a time and I just thought I should just close with that. And just thank all of you for your questions today. I just want to close with a couple of thoughts and really reinforce something Walt said earlier, clearly we know that interest rates move in cycles, and this low rate environment will end at some point in the future. And we'll see the return to more normalized rates. But we're certainly not just waiting around for that to happen. And I'll say, while we're quite pleased by the near-term EPS benefit, and the acquisition supports that 25% to 35% number I referenced earlier. It's really the long term prospects that make us even more excited. And that's why we're really pressing ahead very, very aggressively, but in a way that's entirely consistent with our strategy, our purpose and our DNA. As those actions begin to bear fruit, in some cases quickly and other cases more gradually over time, it just reinforces our confidence and our enthusiasm. We'll look forward to seeing all of you virtually most likely, possibly some in person at the February business update. Stay safe everyone and thank you for your time today."

            "name": "Joe Martinetto",
            "content": "Great, thanks Walt and good morning, everybody. So today, I would characterize my presentation as more of a cameo than a full update. I'd remind everybody that we just closed the transaction a couple of weeks ago. And we were able to do a fair amount of integration planning prior to close. But there are a lot of details that we've just recently been able to share, while we feel very good about the work we've done, and what we're seeing, we're going to need a little time to firm up the executional plans and financial implications before we can provide you with that fuller update. That said, we've already made a number of decisions about platforms and client experience that we'll share today. And we've also moved quickly to recognize some of the closer in synergies; I'll update you on those activities as well.  So let's start with the expense synergies first. Just a reminder, our targets at the time of announcement called for us to realize between $1.8 billion and $2 billion in expense reduction synergies. We spent the last 10 plus months developing plans to achieve this level of savings. And by close we had high level plans at the business unit level to achieve it. We still believe it will take 18 to 36 months to get through broker dealer consolidation, account conversion, and the shutdown of all the redundant systems and functions that are necessary to achieve this level of savings. I'll have more to say about the timeline in a couple of slides.  I'm also focused today on expense synergies as those are likely to occur in a more material way more quickly than revenue synergies. As we've discussed before, the bigger revenue synergies come from the repatriation of the BDA balances, but we do expect that there will also be revenue synergies that are tied to the account conversion, when we'll be able to offer the best of both companies products and services to the combined client base. Those outcomes will be a little longer coming as we're still operating as two separate broker dealers today. With respect to the expense actions, we've already taken steps to achieve between $250 million and $300 million in expense reductions. We've aligned the management structure, and across management in the branch network eliminated over about 1000 roles. We moved aggressively to rationalize the branch network; there was a significant amount of overlap across our footprints which we're eliminating. Of their roughly 260 branches, we're retaining about 55; the majority of the rest will co locate into nearby Schwab branches, where we'll have both Schwab and TD Ameritrade employees.  Our combined branch footprint after the consolidation will be larger with over 400 branches a 140 of which will be shared through conversion, and 90% of our clients will have a branch within 25 miles up from 80% before the transaction. We've also closed the number of previously open management positions, as well as reduced our anticipated marketing spend. While it'll take some time to recognize the full level of synergies, we expect to see additional reductions over the course of the next 36 months. And with the meaningful reductions that I just noted along with other actions that we plan to take, we're thinking we'll exit the first year after the transaction with between one quarter and one third of the expense synergy total in the run rate. Moving on to some of the platform decisions as we've said all along we expect to realize the best of both when it comes to customer facing platforms. Both companies have well regarded and recognized platforms with very complementary strengths. We expect to leverage the existing Schwab's websites mobile applications for investor's independent advisors in automated investing solutions. We'll be adding the thinkorswim web and mobile experiences for traders and supplementing the advisor experience with the trading and rebalancing capabilities from TD Ameritrade advisor platform. That said, we expect that there'll be changes to all of these platforms that we'll need to make for a seamless experience for our combined clients. For example, the trading experience on schwab.com will evolve a bit to serve the more active traders from TD Ameritrade who prefer to use the web. The Schwab Advisor Center will incorporate more integrations with third party platforms to accommodate the advisors who use services where we don't currently have an easy to use integration. I promised I'd have more to say about the timeline for integration earlier and I'd like to remind folks that this is an extraordinarily complex integration. Both firms are large in their own rights and when you combine them and look to add the headroom that's necessary to handle potential spikes in activity, there's a geometric effect on the capacity necessary to run the firm safely. While we're availing ourselves of our own recent experience with integration, as well as the expertise available to us as part of the team is joining from TD Ameritrade and we're eager to get to full synergy recognition, we of course have to balance that with the client experience considerations. We want this to be an incredibly smooth experience for all of our clients, both the retail investors and advisors and we expect to continue to serve the vast majority of them long past integration. At this point, I'll turn the mic over to Peter, and he'll give you details on how all of this works into the financial picture. I'd say that's one of those areas where we weren't able to get into a lot of detail prior to close for competitive purposes. So we are parsing that data today. If anything, I'd say we probably feel a little bit more optimistic about our ability to maintain the majority of that revenue than we did prior to close. But it's still a little early for us to get into a lot of detail on exactly how that's going to play out. So my guess is, we will be in a position at that winter business update to write more details on all of these components. From a revenue perspective, I would echo some of Peter's earlier comments to say that we were pretty enthusiastic about what we're finding. And today thinking through some of the pricing and recognition, implications of decisions that we're going to have to face around how we bring these organizations together. But I would say, we're feeling optimistic about what we're seeing and what some of the recognition opportunities might look like. As you look forward to post conversion, I'd say that a couple of big buckets that we're going to have to dimensionalize here are around being able to provide some of the better trading opportunity in the systems, the TD Ameritrade has built to the Schwab client base, as well as being able to provide some of the more extensive wealth management capabilities the Schwab has built, as the TD Ameritrade existing client base. And if I had to guess a little bit today, I would say, we might see those trading benefits happen a little bit faster than wealth management. Wealth management has to be more of a relationship-type activity that we expect to build over time. We do think that those opportunities are significant, that may take a little longer recognize post conversion. Walt, do you want to start us off on new customers? Peter, do you want to draw to that, and then you can close this out?"

            "name": "Walt Bettinger",
            "content": "Thank you, Rich and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. During certainly what continues to be extraordinary times we all recognize that we're living in a unique and challenging time for everyone. And my best wishes for good health and safety go out to all of you who are joining us on the call. It's really times to like these that have focused and consistent strategy means more than ever, the noise around us from a struggling economy a record low interest rates, a degree of political turmoil can shake those less committed to a sound long term approach.  At Schwab, we remain as committed as ever to our two client side strategy and our key strategic initiatives, scale monetization and segmentation. Our approach is winning in the market. And we believe that our combination with TD Ameritrade will deliver outstanding financial results along with furthering our competitive position in key client segments. As I've said before, we are on offense. And the response from our clients with record and near record metrics supports the efforts that we're making to offer world class value service advice and transparency. Now as of October 6, we have successfully completed the four acquisitions that were announced in the past 15 months. Each of these transactions are strategically important for us, but of course in different ways and each slots in perfectly with those key strategic initiatives I mentioned previously of scale monetization and segmentation. USAA adds to our scale of existing clients. And our exclusive Wealth Management referral arrangement that we have with USAA continues, adding scale for us and should be effective for years to come.  Motive delivers highly talented technologists along with a platform that is helping accelerate our efforts to deliver thematic investing, as well as direct indexing to investors and advisors. And of course, that will in time contribute to our efforts around monetization. That is good for clients. Wasmer, Schroeder accomplishes a similar goal, monetization that's good for our clients, but with maybe a more traditional approach to investment solutions in the fixed income area, and of course their expertise in tax smart fixed income investing is likely to prove especially valuable, as tax rates potentially become an increasingly important consideration for investors after the election.  Of course, the TD Ameritrade acquisition not only builds tremendous scale, but it also delivers outstanding capabilities that serve our segmentation objective. We know that they had a best in class platform for traders, several capabilities that are highly valued within the investment advisor community also. This slide graphically illustrates the scale impact of the TD Ameritrade acquisition. Also it shows the powerful combination of our firm's with net new assets in excess of $75 billion, and almost 1.5 million new brokerage accounts in the third quarter alone, keeping in mind that that third quarter included tax payments, unlike in most years. Now, Peters going to speak a little bit later regarding the near term and longer term financial benefits of our transaction. But for now, I will simply say that they are significant.  Now as strong as our asset gathering and overall financial performance has been we see many untapped opportunities to drive significant asset and revenue growth by leveraging our scale, better monetizing assets in ways that are good for clients, and developing leading offers for key segments of our client base. The M&A has played an important role in pursuing these initiatives. But M&A activity is only one way that will drive these efforts forward with all three key initiatives contributing to our strong growth.  Through the first three quarters of 2020, and of course, this is looking exclusively at Schwab results, clients and trusted us with core net new assets in excess of $160 billion, a 5% organic growth rate, which is consistent with our long term results. Included in there is an all-time monthly record for the month of September with $20 billion in core net new assets. I remember when we reached $2 trillion in firm wide assets, the number one question I received was always could Schwab continue to capture an organic net new asset growth rate in that 5% to 7% range even on such a large base.  Of course, we were confident that we could back down and we remain equally confident today. That'd be sure we talk about a range because as we all recognize that there will be some variability driven by market conditions, as well as employment conditions and those contribute to either accelerating or decelerating money in motion, and therefore, new assets in our category. I think what's clear, though, is what won't change is our ability to keep winning assets, and continue gaining market share, regardless of whatever the environment is around us.  Our organic efforts around scale are also paying dividends in terms of operating efficiency, with almost two thirds of our client households now digitally active, over half of the arrays we serve are leveraging our digital service capabilities. And over three fourths of our client base is now enrolled in paperless reporting. Here is an example of where the pandemic that we're dealing with has actually contributed to more rapid adoption of digital capabilities. And of course, digital adoption and digital initiatives are what I like to refer to as triple wins. And by that I mean that they result in a better experience for our clients through both faster processing as well as a richer overall experience. They contribute to lowering error rates, and also lowering costs for Schwab. And, of course, that in turn benefits both our stockholders as well as our employees as our employees are able to engage in more value added interactions with our clients.  Let me emphasize though, that adoption of digital does not mean that people and specifically our branches in our service centers don't matter. In fact, arguably, they matter as much or more than ever. What digital adoption does mean is that employees can focus on relationships, more than simply processing transactions. And of course, that's exactly what we want, what our clients want, and what we mean when we talk about bringing together really the best of people and technology to our no tradeoffs value proposition. We've demonstrated that when we offer clients and this is both on the retail side and on the RA side, when we offer them high quality solutions at very competitive prices, they vote with their fee [ph].  Use above Schwab managed ETFs is growing again, after a slow down earlier in 2020, largely due to tax last harvesting. Clients continue to enroll in our retail advisory programs, we now have assets they're exceeding $360 billion and clients are increasingly turning to Schwab bank for their lending needs, with loans up over 30% from one year ago. Our success with our asset management and lending products also fuels our confidence in continuing to extend our capabilities. And part of that is ensuring that third party managers provide appropriate compensation for the many services that we provide them and the investors who invest in their products through our platform. These types of efforts will further diversify our model and decrease our reliance on spread based revenue. Whether it's from ongoing negotiations with fund complexes that rely on Schwab to provide shareholder servicing, without helping us cover those costs, to substantial opportunities in thematic investing and direct indexing, to the growth opportunity in the area of retail advisory services and last but not least to the opportunity to deliver premier fixed income advisory to clients at a great value through in house Wasmer Schroeder.  At the same time, we're working hard to build and deliver increasingly segmented capabilities to delight clients of all sizes and types. Whether they are targeted at newer younger investors, which certainly gets a lot of press today, new and creative ways to invest in a more customized or personalized manner through themes and direct indexing, better serving the fastest growing segment of our retail business, which is high net worth and ultra high net worth investors. And creating new and more streamlined experiences for independent investment advisors that we serve and of course, we serve all sides, investment advisors large, small, and in between.  As I've said for a number of years, the future in our industry, in our view belongs to the organizations that deliver a no tradeoffs approach to investing, great value, transparency and trust, omni channel service, a single place to meet all of it investors needs all of this from a company that is both a challenger to the rest of the industry, as well as a beacon of confidence due to our size and scale. In our words, it's no tradeoffs, no limits and all done through client size. At Schwab, we call that modern wealth management. And we think that uniquely define Schwab and is only achievable by a firm with our size, scale, and importantly our focus. In our view, our capabilities, our rather simple strategy, our enormous scale, our culture of service, and our commitment as a challenger company, to continue disrupting to benefit investors and advisors is a combination that no one else in the market can match. In our transfer of account or asset figures tell the story better than I ever could, attracting $2 from core competitors for every dollar they take from us. Strong results versus the global banks and warehouses at 2.2 to one. Strong results versus the independent broker dealers at 1.8 to one an exceptionally strong results versus the mono line fin-tech companies that were asked about so frequently at a ratio of over 200 to one. All contributing to a firm wide TOA [ph] ratio of two to one and as successful as both TD Ameritrade and Schwab have been in taking share for the past four decades the reality is we still collectively have a very small share of an enormous wealth management market in the US.  So just in closing, we know that we are dealing with record low interest rates, and those create short term headwinds. Eventually we'll have relief from this pandemic. Eventually, the economy will get fully back on its feet. Eventually, our belief is that interest rates won't remain at all-time record lows. But in the meantime, we won't be here off course. We won't deviate from our through client side strategy. We won't stop being on offense with our key strategic initiatives of scale monetization and segmentation. And we surely won't stop pursuing disruptive actions that benefit clients, the very soul of a challenger. For those of you who know Schwab, well, you know that we don't measure our progress in quarters, and generally not even in years, but rather in decades. And I've never been more optimistic about what the future decades hold for Schwab.  So I want to transition over to Joe Martinetto, I'm pleased that we're now in a position to begin the process that actually unleashes the potential from combining Schwab and TD Ameritrade as all of you know, Joe is leading that effort. And I know he's looking forward to sharing an initial update on our integration efforts.  So Joe, let me turn it over to you. That does sound like repeated question. So, Will, the two things that tend - or the three -- I guess the three dynamics that tend to drive the balance sheet growth organically, and I'll -- we'll be looking at Legacy Schwab. One is the interest rate environment and then a lower interest rate environment as I mentioned, our clients are less apt to avail themselves of the purchase money funds and CDs, there's just not as much of a yield pickup and not as much of a benefit for them to do that. So they're more likely to leave that cash sitting in their account on our balance sheet. Second, of course is organic growth, because a certain portion of the net new assets we bring every -- every quarter, every year comes in the form of cash. And then third is client relative sentiment about the equity markets, whether they are buying more equities or selling equities. Of course, that is, you know, that's harder to predict, going forward than perhaps those first two items. So, you know, you can imagine, certainly in this low interest rate environment, you can imagine, as we've seen, our balance sheet has grown at a sequence -- at a pace post the end of the first quarter, when we obviously saw that huge surge, at an annualized pace and in the double digit, you certainly can imagine a scenario where that would continue into the next -- as long as those interest rates remain low. Now, if interest rates were increased, one would expect at that pace, a balance sheet growth would -- would come down, and if clients get more bullish on the equity markets that would on the margin tend to slow the pace of balance sheet growth as well. So we're at about -- we're about at 85/15 now fixed to floating on our investment portfolio. And we feel like that's probably about the -- about the right place to be. So I would say that you'd see us look to probably maintain that pretty close. That leads us to a duration in the upper threes. In terms of the rates, reinvestment rates on the fixed portion are in the 90 to 105 basis point range today, and of course that varies on a daily -- weekly if not daily basis, but sort of in that -- in that general range. You're referring on the retail side or on the RIA side or both? Yeah. So we -- we certainly see growth on both sides. Of course, the RIA business continues to have exceptional organic growth. But also on the retail side, as I mentioned, the fastest growing segment of clients for us is high net worth and ultra high net worth clients. Now, they tend to be a little bit of a different kind of client, if you were trying to categorize them, in that the ones who come to us on the retail side tend to maybe be a bit more self-directed, maybe -- they come from the financial world and they're accustomed to managing money or managing their own money whereas on the RIA side, they tend to be more of relying on a professional investment advisor to help them manage their money. But both are growing fairly rapidly. And our plan is to continue to add the services and capabilities that the high net worth and ultra high net worth investor wants even with, again, the different approach to managing money that generally occurs on the retail side and RIA side. Segment services, dedicated relationship capabilities, access to the type of products that both of those types of high net worth and ultra high net worth investors want. Interestingly enough, when we talk to the ones on the retail side, they made a specific decision to come to Schwab. And they would like to stay at Schwab and consolidate assets at Schwab. But we have to make sure that we can deliver for them the type of service experience that they expect, given their significant level of asset. So we will continue to expand those capabilities to meet their needs, the retails ones that are at Schwab, because they want to be at Schwab. The ones served by RIAs are there because that's the best fit for them. Sure. I think -- I think most of our emphasis right now is on making sure that we're here for our clients during -- during what could prove to be a volatile election period. It's -- I would say that our capability to speculate on the outcome of this election is no better than anyone else's, and, so I don't think we are planning on strategic changes at this point in time. I think all the things that you mentioned, are accurate if in fact, you get the outcome for the election that you referenced. And we would at that point in time have to figure out how the interplay between a steeper yield curve as well as some of the less favorable things for our business that you mentioned, if they end up occurring. But right now all the emphasis is really around making sure that we have system availability, capacity, service for our clients, as we go into a period that could be very volatile. And it may be an extended period before we know the outcome of the election, at least, for some offices. Peter, I don't know if you have anything you want to add to that? I think we do have a longer term goal of striving for a balance between spread income and other forms of revenue. And of course, that plays out in two of our three strategic initiatives, very clearly in monetization and segmentation. And the thing that I would just emphasize is that all of our monetization efforts are -- we want to ensure are done in terms of them being good for clients. But you can see them unfolding before you whether it's the acquisition of the technology and the talent from Motif, the acquisition of Wasmer, Schroeder, the negotiations that we are having with firms, who effectively capitalize on our platform and we provide services that they would otherwise have to provide, but yet don't provide any offsetting compensation for those services. These are all in line with actions that we're taking as well as continue to build our advisory solution. But again, the overriding in all of those moves will be to ensure that anything we do is the right thing for our clients. But we are confident that we can drive toward a more balanced scenario in the world you described, where rates stay lower for longer. Of course, if rates do turn and go up with the yield curve steepens, our spread income can increase quite dramatically, quite quickly. And of course, that would make it more challenging. But we're fairly confident in our plans to get to a more balanced approach within a reasonable period of time and are taking all prudent actions to get there. Thanks, I'll step in there on that one. I think we've seen business as usual with maybe one adjustment, and that is that there are a number of TD Ameritrade service advisors who would like to go ahead and make this switch over to the Schwab platform at this point in time rather than wait for us to do that as part of the integration. But the notion that there is some significant movement, if you're getting it that of RA's unhappy with the combination and therefore making moves elsewhere is simply not being backed up by the facts. If they were they would have shown up in the TOA metrics that I shared with you. So that was part of why I showed you those numbers. The clients are excited. They know that we are committed to ending up with a winning platform for them that integrates the best of Schwab and the best of Ameritrade as Bernie Clarke likes to say that it's not going to be one platform or another winning, it's going to be a new platform that combines the best of all. The RA that we talk with are really excited about being a part of that, being part of an organization with our scale and size, the ability to help them grow and as well as protect their clients' assets. So it's been all business as usual to positive if I were to try to summarize it. Sure. It remains a highly competitive market and there is some activity around paying cash in order to get balances so that is still an activity that exists and continues to be an activity that we have questions about its long term logic for companies that intend to be independent and staying in the market over time. I would just say that I guess I would add, I remain optimistic that rational business leadership moves to rational and economically rational decision making over time. Craig, I'll take that. Unfortunately, this is going to be one of those questions. So I'll just say upfront, I'm not going to answer to your satisfaction. We're not going to discuss timing on the introduction for competitive reasons nor are we going to discuss which organizations might go first, but we certainly have every intention of making it available to both. That'll be used slightly differently by retail and by the RAA and so the determinant will be not trying to benefit one segment of our business over another, it'll just be which one we can get it to quicker because of the way they'll utilize the product. Sure. So there's no question there are new entrants into the space. And that is leading to some of the new household formation, it's probably why we tried to share both net new assets figures, which of course, are a very broad definition, right? That net number is made up of new-to-firm households, as well as existing clients, as well as transfers from other financial services or investment services providers. So I don't know that we historically want to break down the components of that net new assets, but we try to give you enough metrics to give you a solid understanding. We report the total net new assets. We give you the new-to-firm household growth, which I think was on one of the pages that Peter shared. And of course, we give you the transfer numbers, which gives you an idea of whether we are winning or losing on a net basis relative to competitors with existing clients who may be residing at Schwab and residing at our competitor. I think we're having success with all three of those, as evidenced by our net new assets, including the record September, and the TOA numbers speak for themselves."

            "content": "Sure, this is Joe again. So I'd say there's very little that's changed in our thinking around how to recognize the synergies and clearly the company's continued to operate and to the extent that we've had some very active service level requirements and those kinds of things this year, both companies have added some staff to take advantage of that. But those kinds of changes haven't had a material impact on the way we've been thinking about actually achieving the synergies. So the first pass through was dominantly focused on senior and executive level management and branches. Over the nearer term, there will be a series of other functions as we look to continue to consolidate predominantly in headquarters types of roles, as you get through things like converting to a single HR platform, there's savings both on the technology and on the people side that they come with those kinds of activities. And those will occur over the course of the next couple of years. A little further out is when you actually get another opportunity to get a bigger bang and expense synergies when you get to that point or we get to that point of being able to do the account conversion. There are a lot of synergies tied up in moving to a single broker dealer from two broker dealers. And there's a material amount of reduction, summon staff to support for a lot across things like technology platforms, real estate footprint that come down once we get to the place where we can really get to a single broker-dealer and run on a single platform. Then I would say there's a little bit of cleanup that goes on past that big bang date as we move to full retirement of some of those platforms and systems and just the cleanup work that doesn't come immediately upon conversion. You get a couple of big events in there that will drive some bigger reductions so we do expect over the course of the next 36 months that you will see continuous recognition of synergies over time, maybe not completely evenly over that window but you should see."

        "content": "Jeff Edwards: Good morning, everyone, from the Lone Star state, and welcome to Schwab's 2023 Spring Business Update. This is Jeff Edwards, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our Co-Chairman and CEO, Walt Bettinger; President, Rick Wurster and CFO, Peter Crawford. Before we jump into the presentation, I'd like to touch on a few housekeeping items. Today's setup is obviously a little bit unique with the business update immediately following this morning's release of our strong first quarter results. That being said, our time here today will still be dedicated to providing you with a broad strategic update of our growing business. Similar to past events, I will be helping facilitate Q&A. So given recent events, the team has a fair amount they like to share with you. So dedicated Q&A time may end up being slightly shorter than usual. Therefore, it is very important that we all strictly adhere to the one question, no follow-up format that has been in place now for several quarters. And we also ask that you vector clarifying a more tactical questions regarding the recently reported quarter to the IR team. Today's slides should be available on the IR website momentarily. And finally, before we move on, let's not forget the mighty wall of words, which reminds us all that the future is uncertain, so please stay in touch with our disclosures. I'd like to turn it over to Walt then.\nWalt Bettinger: Thank you, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our April business update. This is an important opportunity for our team at Schwab to speak directly with all of you to speak with accuracy and facts and to speak with clarity and transparency. We know that the past few weeks have been very challenging for long-term stockholders, which, of course, all of our executives at Schwab are also, me included. Let me start by making a few crystal clear statements. First, our clients, although curious and somewhat surprised about the downward movement in our stock price, remain fully engaged with us and are bringing substantial assets to Schwab on both the retail side and the RIA advisor side. We are winning in the marketplace among clients. Anyone suggesting otherwise, is mistaken. Simply put, our franchise strength and financial model remain very much intact. Second, we did not and have not changed our multi-decade approach to conservatively managing our bank balance sheet. Any suggestions to the contrary of that are false. And although our near-term cost of funding are higher than recent historical levels, and as a result, will impact our near-term earnings. This cost is temporary and should diminish over the coming quarters and could wind down between now and the end of 2024. And third, we are well into the execution of the conversion of the former Ameritrade clients to Schwab. And as we progress through this conversion and beyond, we will ultimately realize substantial expense savings, well beyond the remaining $500 million to $600 million we originally committed to as part of the Ameritrade integration synergies. Now looking at the first quarter, it was a complex environment for investors. Although the equity markets overall performed quite well, investor sentiment was actually quite negative throughout the quarter. The Fed raised interest rates another 50 basis points, while the 5- and 10-year yield on treasuries fell by 39 and 40 basis points, respectively. And yet despite negative investor sentiment, this wasn't reflected in our clients' engagement with us. Clients entrusted us with over $130 billion in core net new assets, with the monthly level increasing each of the 3 months of the quarter, peaking with over $50 billion in March and achieving an organic growth rate in excess of 7%, once again validating our long-term track record of growing client assets in every economic environment. In addition to growth in client assets, clients remained engaged with us in other areas with another quarter of over 1 million new client accounts, over 5 million daily average trades, a Client Promoter Score or Net Promoter Score of 66 and almost $9 billion moved into our investment advisory solutions. Let's go ahead and transition from our client results to discuss some of the corporate financial areas that have been in the press on the minds of investors. And in too many cases, falsely described by some competitors who have tried without much success, is evidenced by our near record March level of net new asset flows to scare clients into leaving Schwab. Again, our franchise and financial model are strong. We have substantial liquidity. We have capital well in excess of regulatory requirements, and our strong profit margins deliver ongoing organic capital formation, which can be used to meet future capital needs. We have industry-leading levels of FDIC insured balances at our bank, our investors' bank. Our balance sheet and investments were and are conservatively managed and managed in a manner consistent with how we have managed our bank balance sheet for the last 2 decades. And for our long-term stockholders, we have great confidence, and our ability to deliver a combination of growth and capital return, just as we have for almost 50 years. So I'd like to go into a bit more detail now on each one of these statements. I've publicly stated multiple times and in multiple formats that we cannot foresee any plausible scenario where we would have to sell securities to meet the liquidity needs of our clients, and that's not an accident. Because we have always planned for the potential of time periods where high liquidity needs exceed our available cash. Of course, these time periods tend to occur when the Fed is raising interest rates rapidly. And while this cycle of interest rate increases has been historically rapid, leading clients to realign their investment cash more quickly than we had predicted. Our advanced planning ensured that we would have the necessary liquidity to meet their demands. We prepare in part by minimizing the issuance of CDs and/or borrowing from the FHLB during more normal times, effectively keeping that dry powder for periods of higher liquidity needs. Of course, accessing this higher cost funding is not something we expect to be anything other than temporary, currently projected to wind down over the next 7 quarters and be largely gone by year-end 2024. I would certainly hope that by this point in time, the short driven speculation that we would find ourselves in a position where we would be forced to sell securities that have temporary paper losses has been put to bed. From a capital standpoint, we have solid levels today, well in excess of regulatory requirements. And we understand the possibility that the AOCI opt-out might well be eliminated and the questions that, that raises about the potential need for capital. At this point, if this scenario does play out and a reasonable time frame is afforded to build the capital to support this change, we feel confident today in our ability to build the necessary capital organically, given our strong profit margins. Even in the stressed market environment this past quarter, we achieved an adjusted pretax margin of almost 46%. And even under some of the most pessimistic scenarios for the future, we are at least 40% pretax. And of course, our unrealized marks on certain securities decline over time, and they've also declined as interest rates have modestly moderated, declines that you'll see happening when you review our first quarter 10-Q. The conservative nature of our bank management is also reflected in the very high percentage of deposits insured under the FDIC limit. At quarter end, approximately 86% of our bank deposits were under the FDIC insured limits. In addition, these deposits are spread among tens of millions of investor accounts. And lastly, there are no groups of investors or advisers who directly influence or encourage collective behavior. The 10 RIA firms whose clients hold the greatest amount of cash on our bank balance sheet, account for barely 2% of total bank deposits and the average transactional cash per account for those RIA firms is less than $13,000. I hope these facts remove any concerns about some sort of ordinated action potentially happening that would meaningfully impact our bank deposits. This is a very important slide. I'd like to dive deeper into our clients' cash behaviors. I know this is a critical area of interest, particularly as it could apply to future levels of bank balance sheet cash and client cash realignments. As I've discussed in the past, when interest rates are near 0, clients tend to co-mingle their transactional cash and their longer-term investment cash together. Of course, there's very little incentive during times like that to move their investment cash into solutions that offer higher yields than bank sweep. But when interest rates rise, we reach out to clients and suggest they consider realigning their investment cash into other solutions, whatever the client sees fit, whether that would be a purchase money fund -- a purchase money market fund, a CD, a treasury security or another appropriate cash solution that the client is interested in. And of course, this has been taking place, predominantly inside Schwab, as rates have been rising over the past year or so. The rate, pace and ultimate level of this realigning has a large impact on our near-term financial results. So not surprising, we study it closely, and we have models that estimate how it will unfold. By several measures we study, we believe that this cash realigning process is now slowing and getting closer to its endpoint, which should then likely reverse to a stage where bank balance sheet cash begins to grow as a result of our organic net new asset growth as well as new accounts that we attract. Now in terms of the slide, we've included a chart that goes back to 2004, and it illustrates multiple time frames where interest rates were relatively high as well as several time frames where interest rates were near 0, often referred to as ZIRP periods. When we study this information, RIA per account basis, what we see as the most accurate way to model this. Transactional cash per account is down to an average of approximately $10,400, a level as low as we have seen in the past 20 years and down about 50% from the peak period during the COVID pandemic. From a percent standpoint, transactional cash per account is at a 20-year low of approximately 5%. Now could it go lower? Yes, of course, but we believe it is closer than ever to finding its ending point. Here's why. If you look at daily Schwab Bank cash movements, a key metric for identifying trends far more important than a quarterly summary. February of this year was lower than January. And if we adjust for the single day after the Silicon Valley Bank failure, where cash movement was modestly elevated, March was lower on a per day basis than February. And through the first half of April, even allowing for tax payments, April is also lower than March, measurably lower. Lastly, it's important to recognize that while some clients did readjust their cash allocations in response to the Silicon Valley Bank failure by buying treasuries or CDs or moving from prime money funds to treasury or government money funds, we also saw a sharp increase in new cash coming into Schwab, consistent with being a safe port in the storm. Now this slide is also a particularly important one as it provides factual information around a topic that has been fraught with inaccuracies in the press and blogs alike that incredibly to me often relied on speculative information from short sellers and competitors. Schwab Bank is a bank for investors. We manage client cash at our bank conservatively and consistently. We manage this cash in the same way we've managed it for the 20 years that we've had our bank. We make what we consider to be conservative loans, almost exclusively to our existing investment clients. Now these loans are either backed by our client securities portfolio or loans against their personal real estate. This makes up about 12% of our assets. We do not make commercial loans as speculated by one of our competitors on national television. The balance is invested primarily in securities. And with this balance, we look to manage credit risk by investing between 85% and 90% in securities backed by the U.S. government or its agencies. That's our approach to credit risk. Now let's talk about duration risk. Again, an area that has been fraught with misinformation. First, let me begin by saying it's important not to confuse as unfortunately some less than savvy alleged researchers and analysts have that maturity or weighted average life is not the same as duration. We have many floating rate securities that have a long life, but essentially zero duration and therefore, do not contribute to negative marks with higher interest rates. And of course, offer increased yields as rates rise. Second, we do not now and never have tried to guess future interest rate movements. Doing so is a fool's game. It's like trying to guess stock market movements. We don't guess and we don't try to time interest rate movements. Our approach is very straight forward. We have historically managed our bank investment portfolio to a duration range between 2.75 and 4 years. And we were approximately 3.5 years as rates began to rise in mid-2022, admittedly, nearer the higher end of our historic range than the lower end of fair criticism. Importantly, our overall duration across the firm's aggregate balance sheets, which includes the banks and the broker-dealers, was about 2.5 years. That is it, not 5, not 10, but 2.5 years. And we all know that even at 2.5 years, this is not low enough to avoid temporary paper losses when rates rise close to 500 basis points in a year. We just felt it was important to be transparent on where we were as this rising rate cycle began. So again, we did not change our historic approach during the COVID pandemic. Contrary to some items I've read and heard, we did not buy securities that would take us out of our historic duration range. But even more bluntly, we did not go out and load up our securities portfolio with long-dated bonds during the pandemic period. Now it can be a fair criticism that we should have changed our 2-decade approach to consistently maintaining a relatively short-term duration bank portfolio during the COVID pandemic in favor of holding primarily cash. That's fair to say. And if we would have known that the Federal Reserve was going to raise rates faster than they ever have in history, in retrospect, that would have been a brilliant move to make. What we did do was to begin to build up higher levels of liquid cash in late 2021 as transitory comments about inflation from the Federal Reserve waned and in early 2022 as the Federal Reserve began discussing increases in interest rates. We increased our normal cash allocation about $60 billion. But given the pace that the Federal Reserve raised rates and therefore, the pace of the resolving client cash realigning, again, in retrospect, $60 billion was not nearly enough, and that led to our need to execute on our other liquidity measures. I started my comments by making clear that our financial model and franchise strength are intact. So the obvious question is, how this manifests itself in terms of earnings growth and our ability to deliver for our stockholders? It's well understood that the temporary cost of higher funding from CDs and FHLB loans will impact our near-term revenue growth and earnings. Hopefully, it is also well understood that, as these borrowings are paid off, that will be an accelerant to our medium-term earnings. But as client cash realigning moderates and eventually reverses and the headwinds from higher cost, temporary funding sources diminishes over the next 7 quarters, what remains? What remains is an extraordinary company. We have a diverse client base spread across approximately 35 million accounts. We have a track record of delivering exceptionally strong organic asset growth in every environment. We are completing the integration of the former Ameritrade client base and adding world-class trading capabilities, along with approximately 10 million new clients, who will be exposed to all the additional products and services that Schwab offers that were not available at Ameritrade, and millions of existing Schwab clients will be exposed to the world-class retail trading platforms that were previously only available to Ameritrade clients. And as a result of the integration process winding down, along with investments that we have made in enhancing efficiency during this integration process, we will be in a position to substantially reduce operating expenses. Again, as I stated, well beyond the remaining $500 million to $600 million we originally committed to as part of the Ameritrade integration synergies. It's a powerful formula. It's a winning formula, and I'm confident that it will be a formula that delivers for our long-term stockholders, as it has since we went public in 1987. So Peter, let me turn it over to you to talk some more about our financial results and projections.\nPeter Crawford: Well, thank you very much, Walt. So there are 3 key points I want you to take away from my portion of the presentation today. First, we're navigating this extraordinary period from a position of strength with robust organic growth, high level profitability, strong and growing capital levels and access to significant liquidity. Second, although the volume of client cash allocation activity has exceeded the expectations embedded in the financial scenario we shared a few months ago, as Walt mentioned, we are seeing signs of the pace beginning to moderate, and we continue to expect a resumption of deposit growth in 2023. And third, our focus at Schwab remains on our clients. And while the various dynamics we're working through create some near-term headwinds, our business continues to power ahead, reinforcing our confidence about the long-term strength of our diversified model and our ability to keep delivering on our through the cycle financial formula. Let's start by briefly reviewing our first quarter results, which we released earlier this morning. Among the many advantages we have as we navigate through this period is our financial strength, our sustained earnings power. There has been so much attention to the balance sheet and dynamics influencing net interest revenue that it feels like some have lost side of the fact that nearly 50% of our revenue comes from other sources such as asset management fees and trading. And while the remaining half is generated through net interest revenue, roughly 1/3 of our interest-earning assets are floating rate, meaning the yield on those assets has increased dramatically in the last 12 months. That diversified all-weather revenue model is reflected in our strong Q1 financial performance, during which we grew revenue by 10% versus the first quarter of 2022. We grew adjusted earnings per share by 21%, and we delivered an adjusted pretax margin of nearly 46%, a level nearly unsurpassed in the financial services industry. Turning to the balance sheet. The evolution of our balance sheet during the quarter reflected continued client cash realignment. We supported this by utilizing temporary funding sources, including issuing more CDs and securing additional advances from the FHLB. Our usage of these was front-loaded and increased modestly by our decision consistent with our conservative management approach to build extra liquidity within our banks, almost doubling the amount of cash on hand in the month of March. Now we also opted to suspend our buybacks during the quarter. And our strong earnings supported organic capital formation, which allowed us to maintain our Tier 1 leverage ratio at 7.1%, well above the regulatory minimum. I know there's been much written -- we'd argue too much written about the tangible common equity ratios, our banking subsidiaries. But those ratios have all increased significantly from the 12/31 levels due to both a $2 billion reduction in the unrealized mark-to-market losses and continued strong capital formation. Those of you who followed the company for a while know that we have a long-term orientation executing a strategy and business model that has delivered for clients and stockholders for multiple decades. I want to emphasize that the current challenges we're facing are quite manageable and the impact on our financial performance is near term, which means that Schwab's long-term financial model of growth plus capital return remains firmly intact. Though, as we have discussed, there are some early signs of moderation of the client cash allocation activity, the overall level to start the year has exceeded the assumptions incorporated within the scenario shared with winter business update. That means we've utilized a higher level of supplemental funding with the vast majority of that now expected to be paid off by the end of 2024. This temporary -- emphasis temporary mix shift toward higher cost of funds is expected to pressure the next few quarters of revenue at which point the impact should start to decrease, reverse. We now expect Q2 revenue to be down a mid- to upper single-digit percent versus the second quarter of 2022. But it will have very minimal impact on our long-term financial performance, with our NIM, net interest margin still poised to increase throughout 2024 and approach 3% by the end of 2025, even if rates fall from current levels as the market anticipates. Now it's important, I think, to put that NIM outlook into perspective. As I mentioned earlier, net interest revenue only accounts for half of our revenue. And with an adjusted pretax margin well in the upper 40s, we can continue to produce margins that would be the envy of most other financial services firms even as we navigate these dynamics. And remember, that all this has been happening, we have been adding clients, adding net new assets, increasing the adoption of advice and lending and moving forward on the Ameritrade integration. Regarding expenses, disciplined expense management has been a hallmark of our financial formula. And throughout our history, we have taken steps to pull back on our spending when we're facing environmental headwinds without sacrificing the client experience or undermining long-term growth. As Walt said earlier, we feel very confident about our ability to deliver over $500 million of expense synergies by the end of 2024, as we complete the integration of Ameritrade. And as we do so, it's also a good opportunity for us to take a step back and examine our overall spending levels to look for additional efficiencies as we continue our decade's long focus on driving down our expense on client assets, or EOCA, which we view as a key competitive advantage. And finally, our capital ratios -- our capital position, our capital ratios remain very strong. As Walt noted in his remarks, even if we have to eventually absorb AOCI into our regulatory capital ratios, we see a clear path organically for our Tier 1 leverage ratio, inclusive of AOCI, to exceed 5% within the next year and cross 6.5% by the end of 2024, even if rates stay flat, thanks to our strong earnings, a reduction in balance sheet assets even after deposit growth rebounds as we pay off the supplemental funding and the continued reduction of our AOCI as our securities portfolio matures. And I note that, again, even if rates remain flat, we'd expect those mark-to-market losses to decrease by a further $7 billion between now and the end of 2024. And obviously, more if rates fall as the market is expecting. Putting it all together, we're not blind to the near-term dynamics we're navigating, but we're very confident that our financial formula will reassert itself as we emerge from this period. And that formula, of course, starts with taking care of clients, growing accounts and assets, deepening relationships, building our capabilities, expanding our moat. That is what builds long-term earnings power and will be the driver of performance for our stockholders over time. And to tell you more about the strength of our franchise and how we're continuing to serve our clients, it's my pleasure to turn it over to Rick.\nRick Wurster: Thank you, Peter, and hello, everyone. In the winter business update, I described how well Schwab is positioned to sustain our organic growth rate of 5% to 7% over the long term through a combination of growth from existing clients, attracting new clients and growth from our strategic initiatives. First quarter was a great example of this as we grew net new assets by over 7%. As I shared with you our business results, I'd like to leave you with 3 takeaways. First, our business is thriving, and we again delivered strong organic client growth. Second, through the volatility in March, we saw an increase in net new assets and client engagement and asset flows that the bank remains steady. We emerged from a crisis not weaker, but stronger. Third, our strategic initiatives are paying off and lots of opportunity remains. Let's dive into the results in more detail. To put it simply, we are winning across all fronts. We're winning with existing clients, with new clients and on both the retail and RIA sides of our business. Within Investor Services, we attracted $60 billion in core net new assets. In addition, we saw an 18% year-over-year increase in high net worth, net new assets in the quarter. Our note trade-offs approach continues to attract clients and engender trust from our existing clients, and that was particularly true in a period of uncertainty. As I mentioned in our winter business update, our client base continues to get younger with 56% of new-to-firm households under 40 this quarter. This is notable because with an average age under 50, our clients are still accumulating assets. Within Advisor Services, we had an outstanding quarter of growth with $71 billion in core net new assets. When the going got tough in March, our growth accelerated with $32 billion in NNA in March alone in Advisor Services. In periods of uncertainty and heightened volatility, advisors win. They win because they are trusted fiduciaries with clients' best interest in mind. And we win because we are the trusted partner of RIAs and partner with them to deliver for clients in all environments. Our TOA ratio remained high and was in excess of 2% for the quarter. We are committed to helping RIAs of all sizes grow by delivering the leading custody platform with no fees, alongside practice management support, industry advocacy and relationship support RIAs can count on. There are no trade-offs. In summary, our business is thriving. Our note trade-off approach was recognized by the industry. The third-party accolades you see on the screen speak to the way we serve our clients each and every day. We were recognized by Investor's Business Daily as the #1 online retail broker overall, by J.D. Power as the #1 full-service broker and for the sixth consecutive year Schwab was named one of Fortune Magazine's top 50 World's Most Admired Companies. I'd like to turn now to our strategic initiatives of scale and efficiency, win-win monetization and client segmentation. We are continuing to advance these initiatives within our strategic focus areas. And as I mentioned, these are paying off with tangible wins in the first quarter of this year. Let me start with scale and efficiency. Integration remains our top priority. We successfully completed our first client transition group in February, bringing over around 500,000 client accounts, including a small number of advisors. Service teams achieved an average speed to answer of just 6 seconds during the conversion, a good indication of how seamlessly the transition went after years of preparation. We remain on track to bring over 13 million clients this year, representing 97% of Ameritrade clients, with the remaining 3% our most active traders coming over in 2024. And as Walt mentioned earlier, we are on track to achieve $1.8 billion to $2 billion in run rate expense synergies by the end of 2024. Most important is the client benefit we see. In retail, clients will benefit from the combination of our modern wealth management platform, alongside the leading trading and education platform in the industry. For advisors, we will add iRebal and thinkpipes, 2 capabilities advisors love to an offer that as it stands as no trade-offs. Turning now to win-win monetization. One of our priorities is growing our wealth business. Wealth is an area in which we delight clients, as the Client Promoter Scores of wealth clients are typically the highest at Schwab. Our clients are increasingly asking for help and advice, providing us with a growth opportunity, and wealth offers a diversifying source of economics to us as a business. We've been investing heavily to deliver for clients and accelerate our growth, and we saw meaningful progress in the first quarter. Net flows into the Wasmer Schroeder strategies were $1.5 billion and assets under management surpassed $17 billion. This is a clear example of a win-win opportunity for clients in Schwab. The offer brought down the cost of access to fixed income managed accounts on Schwab's platform and interest from clients has been strong as Wasmer represented the majority of net flows in the fixed income managed accounts. We launched several key enhancements to Schwab Personalized Indexing, including more customization and digital capabilities. Retail clients who work with Schwab FC can now exclude more individual stocks as well as entire industries and sub-industries from their portfolios. We also launched a digital dashboard for retail clients that shows a real-time view of their account value and highlights clearly the value of tax loss harvesting. And clients continue to turn to Schwab for advice during market volatility. Schwab Wealth Advisory had $3.2 billion in net flows in the first quarter, the highest quarter of net flows in the history of the offer, as both Schwab and Ameritrade clients increasingly find the offer attractive. Finally, we continue to meet the specific needs of our client segments. We are launching this year Schwab Private Client Services and Schwab Private Wealth Services for our high net worth and ultra-high net worth clients. We are winning with this client segment today and the differentiated service, support and offering will further add to our no trade-offs experience for this client segment. Our world-class trader offering remains unparalleled in the industry. We released new features on thinkorswim while preparing to convert thinkorswim clients and preparing to make the offer available to Schwab clients this year. Another key priority in this focus area is to provide tailored solutions and experiences for RIAs of all sizes. In the first quarter, we acquired Family Wealth Alliance, a membership organization that provides resources to the family wealth community serving ultra-high net worth clients. The acquisition continues a relationship that has existed between the 2 companies for years. And together, we'll be able to expand the services we offer for multifamily offices and single-family offices. We are thriving and our growth initiatives are paying off. I shared in the winter business update some of the statistics you see on the left side of this page. They show we have lots of opportunity in front of us. We remain confident we can close the share of wallet opportunity I described by introducing clients to the collective capabilities of our integrated firm. We also believe we can accelerate the growth of our wealth business, both at Schwab and by introducing it to Ameritrade clients. We saw very positive signs this quarter as it was our strongest quarter of flows ever into full-service wealth solutions. And 95% of eligible Ameritrade FCs enrolled a client into a wealth solution, a very promising sign for the future. We continue to invest in our lending platform to increasingly be there for clients in the future. And finally, the combination with Ameritrade allows us to enhance our trading capabilities for a highly engaged and important client segment. Investing in a thinkorswim platform and bringing the powerful platform tools and education to our trader clients will be an important differentiator for Schwab as we look to the future. I'd like to wrap up where I started. We are in a position of strength. Our business thrived in the first quarter and our growth accelerated through the recent market volatility. The virtuous cycle will continue to help us sustain attractive organic NNA growth from both new and existing clients. We are continuing to execute on our key strategic focus areas of scale and efficiency, win-win monetization and client segmentation. We saw meaningful impact from some of those initiatives in the first quarter, while other initiatives will help accelerate the growth of our business into the future. We are delivering wins for clients and the firm each quarter. The future is bright. With that, I will turn it over to Jeff for Q&A.\nJeff Edwards: Operator, let's turn to the queue and please remind everyone how they can ask a question that they'd like.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDan Fannon: A lot of debate that this cycle has raised the client awareness for cash. And given the ease of access and movement today, the historical cash allocations are likely to be different going forward. So as you look over the long term, how do you think about sweet cash in the percentages and how that may be different than what we've seen historically?\nWalt Bettinger: Thanks, Dan. I'm going to go ahead and comment on this. So I think when you look at client cash realigning, we feel fairly confident that the metrics we've shown have good basis in history. I guess I would encourage you to think of a client cash aligning. It's an event, it's not a process. And I'm going to illustrate that by an example. If you have a retail client that has, say, build up $50,000 in cash during the pandemic period. And they look at that and say, well, I want to keep 20,000 of that liquid available for immediate trading or other uses, paying bills, they don't take that $30,000 and say, \"Well, I'm going to move $10,000 this quarter and $10,000 next quarter and then $10,000 several quarters in the future.\" It's an event. They reinvest the $30,000. And so what you generally will see is you'll see a rapid acceleration of client cash realigning early in the process of rate rise, let's call it in the first year. And then you begin to see it go the other way. And we think, as it goes the other way, it goes the other way in a relatively accelerating manner because, again, the event has occurred. The client, in my example, has moved their entire $30,000. So we understand the question. We think that the cash, as we indicated, the cash realigning process is slowing. We are very encouraged by what we see in April with measurable slowing. Again, we're looking at 3 consecutive months of declines, and we feel very good about the chart and the results we're able to share with you.\nOperator: And does that conclude your question Mr. Fannon?\nDan Fannon: Yes.\nOperator: The next question is from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler.\nRich Repetto: Walt and Peter, and first, thank you for doing the timely call. And at least I hope you consider this format going forward. But I guess my question is sort of related to the first question. There was -- we calculate $44 billion, I guess, in declining balance sheet, cut cash or uninvested sweep cash. So -- and helped by organic close in March that you talked about. But my question is, your terminology has changed a little bit, I think. But anyway, do we still expect 8% to 12% decline in the average interest-earning assets, Peter? And that's factoring in sort of this protection of AOCI. Does that factor in it if you're even at all trying to keep aware of that or manage that risk. So the 8% to 12% average interest-earning asset declined by December 1 -- December?\nPeter Crawford: Thanks, Rich, for your question. So yes, we still do think that 8% to 12% decline in interest-earning assets is the right way to think about it. The way that we fund those assets may be a bit different than what we had anticipated when we shared at the winter business update, but the overall asset decline is a function of the assets rolling off and that sort of the gradual roll off of our securities portfolio.\nOperator: The next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Blostein: I was hoping we can double-click on some of your capital management comments. It sounds like if you were to start to include AOCI changes in capital, you expect it to be a bit of an organic build, and you provided some sort of stats around it. Why not sell a significant chunk of the securities portfolio? I understand it will crystallize the loss, but your Tier 1 leverage actually will not move significantly when you do that. So help us think through maybe some puts and takes from doing something like that, taking the loss but also at the same time, significantly enhancing the firm's earnings power since $60 billion plus of that securities book is massively at the water?\nPeter Crawford: Thanks for the question. So I guess I'd say a couple of things. Certainly, you are right that if we were to sell the securities -- a meaningful portion of our securities portfolio, it would actually be accretive to our capital levels, if you included that -- or certainly agree to our tangible capital levels. We said multiple times that we see no reason, no need to be forced to sell securities, given the strong -- the ample access to liquidity and the nature of our deposit base and so forth. Beyond that, just don't really want to speculate or sort of talk in hypotheticals about the conditions under which we would sell that securities portfolio. I just would say that we see no need to do so. But of course, we're always going to be thinking about what's the right thing for stockholders, but we see no reason to do so and certainly wouldn't do it right now, given sort of some of the volatility, if you will, in the market around firms that have made that decision.\nOperator: The next question is from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan.\nKen Worthington: You broke the BDA investments, I think, in the third-party BDAs this quarter. With BDA balances down $20 billion in 1Q '23 and floating rate securities down to $2.2 billion in the quarter, do you foresee having to break the TD managed BDA investments? If so, is this a charge that you would be responsible for? And what do you foresee as the charges needed to maintain this program, given your outlook for sorting this year?\nJeff Edwards: Ken, it's Jeff. Obviously, that's -- there's a lot of nuance with that question and just kind of in the interest of time, why don't we circle up kind of offline and we can walk through kind of what's available there and all the public disclosures. So I'll give you a chance if you have one other question you want to touch on.\nOperator: The next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Peter, if you could just comment on the pace of the wholesale borrowing. If we are seeing the cash sorting flow throughout the year, why not wind that down more quickly instead of having that conclude more in 2024? It seems like if you are in a position where the balance sheet will start growing again later in the year, you would be in a position between the organic growth of cash coming in from the securities portfolios and cash growth from clients that you could potentially wind most of that down certainly by year-end or at the beginning of 2024? Any comment on the pace of that.\nPeter Crawford: Sure. So some of the -- certainly, the CDs that we issue are termed out. So it's not like we can recall those necessarily. And the FHLB advances have different terms. But as I mentioned, we -- the decision to build up cash in March meant that we front-loaded some of that activity. So of course, if we -- as we see the pace of this client realignment slow, very reasonable to expect that, of course, we will initiate less advances and let those advances that we have roll off. And so absolutely, we could see this roll off very, very quickly, even as we start to see a resumption of deposit growth over the course of latter part of '23 and then into 2024. And so I mean, the key point on these advances is these are limited and they're temporary. This is not something that is going to be part of our long-term financial picture, and we will certainly pay them off as quickly as we can.\nOperator: The next question is from Mike Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMike Cyprys: I want to circle back multiyear commentary around the ability to deliver substantial expense savings beyond the $500 million to $600 million or so. I was just hoping you might be able to help quantify how meaningful that could be? Is that $1 billion? Is that $2 billion? And maybe you can expand on where that's coming from? What are some of the actions that you guys might be able to take to hit that? And how do you ensure this doesn't hit the overall growth in customer and overall assets?\nWalt Bettinger: Yes. Thanks, Mike. So I don't think, at this point, we're going to quantify the extent that we believe that we can generate ongoing expense saves beyond the $500 million to $600 million that we have committed to and have remaining in the integration, but we think it is substantial. And yes, it's important to keep in mind that, as we approach this integration, one of the decisions we made was that getting the integration right was our #1 priority. And therefore, we were willing to spend quite aggressively along the way to ensure that there was nothing that got in the way of ensuring the integration went as well as smoothly as it could possibly go, even if it meant ratcheting up spending to a level that was much higher than maybe we would have thought several years ago. So we have the opportunities that I mentioned, and then we have the opportunity after multiple years of allowing spending to grow relatively quickly to do a step back and evaluate it overall. And our early work gives us the confidence to say that it is meaningfully higher than the remaining synergies, but I don't think we're ready to quantify it yet. The one thing I will make clear though is, as we have done in the past when we made moves around expense that were significant, we will protect the client experience. So we will not be looking at impacting the parts of the organization that build relationships with clients that serve clients and that deliver that client experience.\nOperator: The next question is from Bill Katz with Credit Suisse.\nBill Katz: Also appreciate you tightening up the window between this and the earnings. Super helpful. Walt or Peter, just a question, as you think about lessons learned from this cycle versus prior cycles, and I appreciate you're consistently running the franchise, but should we be assuming a higher core deposit beta all else being equal to avoid these kinds of dynamics we've all experienced in the last month or so? And on the other side of the earning asset side, would you envision running a more liquid earning asset strategy, all else being equal?\nPeter Crawford: Yes. So thanks for the question, Bill. So in terms of the deposit pricing, if you will, I mean, our philosophy on that hasn't changed, right? Our clients keep -- as we know from history that our clients have sort of 2 buckets of cash, their transactional cash and their investment cash. And our philosophy on the transactional cash is to offer a rate that is very competitive. Certainly, today is at 45 basis points. It's a lot better than what clients can earn in their checking accounts at most of the traditional banks and then to offer our clients a range of options for their investment cash that are, in many cases, industry leading, whether that's access to treasuries or brokered CDs or purchase money funds or whatever it might be. And what we've seen is -- and that's served us well for multiple decades. And whether we pay 45 basis points or 65 basis points or 100 basis points for that transactional cash, it doesn't make -- it makes very, very little influence on client behavior. So I don't necessarily see that aspect of our philosophy changing. Of course, we'll -- as we always do, we'll learn from the experience from what we learned about client behavior, we'll have to take into consideration potential regulatory changes and we'll adapt. And -- but I have every confidence that we'll thrive as we have every time we've faced changes around us previously, whether it was when the dot-com bubble burst in 2000 or whether it was when we launched the bank and came under Fed supervision or went to 0 commissions in every single situation, we adapted and we came out the other end even stronger than we were going into it. And that's because we stay -- as Walt and Rick talked about, we stay focused on our clients and doing right by our clients. And if we do that, everything else will take care of itself.\nJeff Edwards: Great. And operator, I think we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Our last question is from Ben Budish with Barclays.\nBen Budish: I just wanted to ask kind of about your approach to buybacks. You mentioned earlier in the call that you had suspended them for the meantime. What are the sort of data points you are looking at or indicators that would cause you to get more positive and feel comfortable resuming there?\nPeter Crawford: Yes. Thanks, Ben. I think what we would like to see a little bit more clarity on the regulatory front and what's going to happen with how capital is treated and a time line there. As I said, we feel very confident in our ability to build into the potential inclusion of AOCI into our regulatory capital ratios, but we'd like to see a little bit more clarity there before we would, I think, strongly consider or look to resume the buybacks. Of course, our buybacks are always opportunistic, not programmatic, as we've said multiple times, but I think that's probably one of the key points we want to wait for.\nJeff Edwards: We'll turn it over to Walt to close this out today.\nWalt Bettinger: Thanks, Jeff, and thanks, everyone, for joining in and participating, and thanks for the feedback on the timing of this update relative to our earnings report, and please continue to provide that feedback. And we'll be -- look to be responsive to what we hear from all of you around the best time to do these updates. I think, as all of you know, I've been doing this a long time. This is my 15th year as CEO of Schwab. And during that time, I've seen a lot of different environments. Good is as well as much more difficult ones. But when I look at that history, what's consistent to me is that long-term success comes from maintaining a focus on clients. There are always going to be circumstances that come up on a periodic basis that have more of a short-term impact. And we're well aware. We're not oblivious to what's going on. We also know that we have driven much of what has gone on that has affected our near-term earnings because we've been proactively reaching out to our clients of all sizes for the last year and explaining to them the options that they should consider with their investment in cash. But again, I'd like to put this in the context of what I led with around clients. It's the right thing to do. And it's what we would do during this environment if we're faced with this environment again. We're well aware that long-term success comes from a focus on clients. And we're well aware that our bank is unique as it serves as a bank for investors. We're also well aware that as storms come, storms also go. Eventually, they come to an end. And what we know from history is that when those storms and the firms who stand tall or those who have a focus on clients. And that's something that I believe you can count on for Schwab as you have for many years in the past and can count on again in the future. Thanks again for all of your time today. We very much appreciate it, and we appreciate the thoughtful questions.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Crawford",
            "content": "Well, thank you very much, Walt. So there are 3 key points I want you to take away from my portion of the presentation today. First, we're navigating this extraordinary period from a position of strength with robust organic growth, high level profitability, strong and growing capital levels and access to significant liquidity. Second, although the volume of client cash allocation activity has exceeded the expectations embedded in the financial scenario we shared a few months ago, as Walt mentioned, we are seeing signs of the pace beginning to moderate, and we continue to expect a resumption of deposit growth in 2023. And third, our focus at Schwab remains on our clients. And while the various dynamics we're working through create some near-term headwinds, our business continues to power ahead, reinforcing our confidence about the long-term strength of our diversified model and our ability to keep delivering on our through the cycle financial formula. Let's start by briefly reviewing our first quarter results, which we released earlier this morning. Among the many advantages we have as we navigate through this period is our financial strength, our sustained earnings power. There has been so much attention to the balance sheet and dynamics influencing net interest revenue that it feels like some have lost side of the fact that nearly 50% of our revenue comes from other sources such as asset management fees and trading. And while the remaining half is generated through net interest revenue, roughly 1/3 of our interest-earning assets are floating rate, meaning the yield on those assets has increased dramatically in the last 12 months. That diversified all-weather revenue model is reflected in our strong Q1 financial performance, during which we grew revenue by 10% versus the first quarter of 2022. We grew adjusted earnings per share by 21%, and we delivered an adjusted pretax margin of nearly 46%, a level nearly unsurpassed in the financial services industry. Turning to the balance sheet. The evolution of our balance sheet during the quarter reflected continued client cash realignment. We supported this by utilizing temporary funding sources, including issuing more CDs and securing additional advances from the FHLB. Our usage of these was front-loaded and increased modestly by our decision consistent with our conservative management approach to build extra liquidity within our banks, almost doubling the amount of cash on hand in the month of March. Now we also opted to suspend our buybacks during the quarter. And our strong earnings supported organic capital formation, which allowed us to maintain our Tier 1 leverage ratio at 7.1%, well above the regulatory minimum. I know there's been much written -- we'd argue too much written about the tangible common equity ratios, our banking subsidiaries. But those ratios have all increased significantly from the 12/31 levels due to both a $2 billion reduction in the unrealized mark-to-market losses and continued strong capital formation. Those of you who followed the company for a while know that we have a long-term orientation executing a strategy and business model that has delivered for clients and stockholders for multiple decades. I want to emphasize that the current challenges we're facing are quite manageable and the impact on our financial performance is near term, which means that Schwab's long-term financial model of growth plus capital return remains firmly intact. Though, as we have discussed, there are some early signs of moderation of the client cash allocation activity, the overall level to start the year has exceeded the assumptions incorporated within the scenario shared with winter business update. That means we've utilized a higher level of supplemental funding with the vast majority of that now expected to be paid off by the end of 2024. This temporary -- emphasis temporary mix shift toward higher cost of funds is expected to pressure the next few quarters of revenue at which point the impact should start to decrease, reverse. We now expect Q2 revenue to be down a mid- to upper single-digit percent versus the second quarter of 2022. But it will have very minimal impact on our long-term financial performance, with our NIM, net interest margin still poised to increase throughout 2024 and approach 3% by the end of 2025, even if rates fall from current levels as the market anticipates. Now it's important, I think, to put that NIM outlook into perspective. As I mentioned earlier, net interest revenue only accounts for half of our revenue. And with an adjusted pretax margin well in the upper 40s, we can continue to produce margins that would be the envy of most other financial services firms even as we navigate these dynamics. And remember, that all this has been happening, we have been adding clients, adding net new assets, increasing the adoption of advice and lending and moving forward on the Ameritrade integration. Regarding expenses, disciplined expense management has been a hallmark of our financial formula. And throughout our history, we have taken steps to pull back on our spending when we're facing environmental headwinds without sacrificing the client experience or undermining long-term growth. As Walt said earlier, we feel very confident about our ability to deliver over $500 million of expense synergies by the end of 2024, as we complete the integration of Ameritrade. And as we do so, it's also a good opportunity for us to take a step back and examine our overall spending levels to look for additional efficiencies as we continue our decade's long focus on driving down our expense on client assets, or EOCA, which we view as a key competitive advantage. And finally, our capital ratios -- our capital position, our capital ratios remain very strong. As Walt noted in his remarks, even if we have to eventually absorb AOCI into our regulatory capital ratios, we see a clear path organically for our Tier 1 leverage ratio, inclusive of AOCI, to exceed 5% within the next year and cross 6.5% by the end of 2024, even if rates stay flat, thanks to our strong earnings, a reduction in balance sheet assets even after deposit growth rebounds as we pay off the supplemental funding and the continued reduction of our AOCI as our securities portfolio matures. And I note that, again, even if rates remain flat, we'd expect those mark-to-market losses to decrease by a further $7 billion between now and the end of 2024. And obviously, more if rates fall as the market is expecting. Putting it all together, we're not blind to the near-term dynamics we're navigating, but we're very confident that our financial formula will reassert itself as we emerge from this period. And that formula, of course, starts with taking care of clients, growing accounts and assets, deepening relationships, building our capabilities, expanding our moat. That is what builds long-term earnings power and will be the driver of performance for our stockholders over time. And to tell you more about the strength of our franchise and how we're continuing to serve our clients, it's my pleasure to turn it over to Rick. Thanks, Rich, for your question. So yes, we still do think that 8% to 12% decline in interest-earning assets is the right way to think about it. The way that we fund those assets may be a bit different than what we had anticipated when we shared at the winter business update, but the overall asset decline is a function of the assets rolling off and that sort of the gradual roll off of our securities portfolio. Thanks for the question. So I guess I'd say a couple of things. Certainly, you are right that if we were to sell the securities -- a meaningful portion of our securities portfolio, it would actually be accretive to our capital levels, if you included that -- or certainly agree to our tangible capital levels. We said multiple times that we see no reason, no need to be forced to sell securities, given the strong -- the ample access to liquidity and the nature of our deposit base and so forth. Beyond that, just don't really want to speculate or sort of talk in hypotheticals about the conditions under which we would sell that securities portfolio. I just would say that we see no need to do so. But of course, we're always going to be thinking about what's the right thing for stockholders, but we see no reason to do so and certainly wouldn't do it right now, given sort of some of the volatility, if you will, in the market around firms that have made that decision. Sure. So some of the -- certainly, the CDs that we issue are termed out. So it's not like we can recall those necessarily. And the FHLB advances have different terms. But as I mentioned, we -- the decision to build up cash in March meant that we front-loaded some of that activity. So of course, if we -- as we see the pace of this client realignment slow, very reasonable to expect that, of course, we will initiate less advances and let those advances that we have roll off. And so absolutely, we could see this roll off very, very quickly, even as we start to see a resumption of deposit growth over the course of latter part of '23 and then into 2024. And so I mean, the key point on these advances is these are limited and they're temporary. This is not something that is going to be part of our long-term financial picture, and we will certainly pay them off as quickly as we can. Yes. So thanks for the question, Bill. So in terms of the deposit pricing, if you will, I mean, our philosophy on that hasn't changed, right? Our clients keep -- as we know from history that our clients have sort of 2 buckets of cash, their transactional cash and their investment cash. And our philosophy on the transactional cash is to offer a rate that is very competitive. Certainly, today is at 45 basis points. It's a lot better than what clients can earn in their checking accounts at most of the traditional banks and then to offer our clients a range of options for their investment cash that are, in many cases, industry leading, whether that's access to treasuries or brokered CDs or purchase money funds or whatever it might be. And what we've seen is -- and that's served us well for multiple decades. And whether we pay 45 basis points or 65 basis points or 100 basis points for that transactional cash, it doesn't make -- it makes very, very little influence on client behavior. So I don't necessarily see that aspect of our philosophy changing. Of course, we'll -- as we always do, we'll learn from the experience from what we learned about client behavior, we'll have to take into consideration potential regulatory changes and we'll adapt. And -- but I have every confidence that we'll thrive as we have every time we've faced changes around us previously, whether it was when the dot-com bubble burst in 2000 or whether it was when we launched the bank and came under Fed supervision or went to 0 commissions in every single situation, we adapted and we came out the other end even stronger than we were going into it. And that's because we stay -- as Walt and Rick talked about, we stay focused on our clients and doing right by our clients. And if we do that, everything else will take care of itself. Yes. Thanks, Ben. I think what we would like to see a little bit more clarity on the regulatory front and what's going to happen with how capital is treated and a time line there. As I said, we feel very confident in our ability to build into the potential inclusion of AOCI into our regulatory capital ratios, but we'd like to see a little bit more clarity there before we would, I think, strongly consider or look to resume the buybacks. Of course, our buybacks are always opportunistic, not programmatic, as we've said multiple times, but I think that's probably one of the key points we want to wait for."

            "name": "Walt Bettinger",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our April business update. This is an important opportunity for our team at Schwab to speak directly with all of you to speak with accuracy and facts and to speak with clarity and transparency. We know that the past few weeks have been very challenging for long-term stockholders, which, of course, all of our executives at Schwab are also, me included. Let me start by making a few crystal clear statements. First, our clients, although curious and somewhat surprised about the downward movement in our stock price, remain fully engaged with us and are bringing substantial assets to Schwab on both the retail side and the RIA advisor side. We are winning in the marketplace among clients. Anyone suggesting otherwise, is mistaken. Simply put, our franchise strength and financial model remain very much intact. Second, we did not and have not changed our multi-decade approach to conservatively managing our bank balance sheet. Any suggestions to the contrary of that are false. And although our near-term cost of funding are higher than recent historical levels, and as a result, will impact our near-term earnings. This cost is temporary and should diminish over the coming quarters and could wind down between now and the end of 2024. And third, we are well into the execution of the conversion of the former Ameritrade clients to Schwab. And as we progress through this conversion and beyond, we will ultimately realize substantial expense savings, well beyond the remaining $500 million to $600 million we originally committed to as part of the Ameritrade integration synergies. Now looking at the first quarter, it was a complex environment for investors. Although the equity markets overall performed quite well, investor sentiment was actually quite negative throughout the quarter. The Fed raised interest rates another 50 basis points, while the 5- and 10-year yield on treasuries fell by 39 and 40 basis points, respectively. And yet despite negative investor sentiment, this wasn't reflected in our clients' engagement with us. Clients entrusted us with over $130 billion in core net new assets, with the monthly level increasing each of the 3 months of the quarter, peaking with over $50 billion in March and achieving an organic growth rate in excess of 7%, once again validating our long-term track record of growing client assets in every economic environment. In addition to growth in client assets, clients remained engaged with us in other areas with another quarter of over 1 million new client accounts, over 5 million daily average trades, a Client Promoter Score or Net Promoter Score of 66 and almost $9 billion moved into our investment advisory solutions. Let's go ahead and transition from our client results to discuss some of the corporate financial areas that have been in the press on the minds of investors. And in too many cases, falsely described by some competitors who have tried without much success, is evidenced by our near record March level of net new asset flows to scare clients into leaving Schwab. Again, our franchise and financial model are strong. We have substantial liquidity. We have capital well in excess of regulatory requirements, and our strong profit margins deliver ongoing organic capital formation, which can be used to meet future capital needs. We have industry-leading levels of FDIC insured balances at our bank, our investors' bank. Our balance sheet and investments were and are conservatively managed and managed in a manner consistent with how we have managed our bank balance sheet for the last 2 decades. And for our long-term stockholders, we have great confidence, and our ability to deliver a combination of growth and capital return, just as we have for almost 50 years. So I'd like to go into a bit more detail now on each one of these statements. I've publicly stated multiple times and in multiple formats that we cannot foresee any plausible scenario where we would have to sell securities to meet the liquidity needs of our clients, and that's not an accident. Because we have always planned for the potential of time periods where high liquidity needs exceed our available cash. Of course, these time periods tend to occur when the Fed is raising interest rates rapidly. And while this cycle of interest rate increases has been historically rapid, leading clients to realign their investment cash more quickly than we had predicted. Our advanced planning ensured that we would have the necessary liquidity to meet their demands. We prepare in part by minimizing the issuance of CDs and/or borrowing from the FHLB during more normal times, effectively keeping that dry powder for periods of higher liquidity needs. Of course, accessing this higher cost funding is not something we expect to be anything other than temporary, currently projected to wind down over the next 7 quarters and be largely gone by year-end 2024. I would certainly hope that by this point in time, the short driven speculation that we would find ourselves in a position where we would be forced to sell securities that have temporary paper losses has been put to bed. From a capital standpoint, we have solid levels today, well in excess of regulatory requirements. And we understand the possibility that the AOCI opt-out might well be eliminated and the questions that, that raises about the potential need for capital. At this point, if this scenario does play out and a reasonable time frame is afforded to build the capital to support this change, we feel confident today in our ability to build the necessary capital organically, given our strong profit margins. Even in the stressed market environment this past quarter, we achieved an adjusted pretax margin of almost 46%. And even under some of the most pessimistic scenarios for the future, we are at least 40% pretax. And of course, our unrealized marks on certain securities decline over time, and they've also declined as interest rates have modestly moderated, declines that you'll see happening when you review our first quarter 10-Q. The conservative nature of our bank management is also reflected in the very high percentage of deposits insured under the FDIC limit. At quarter end, approximately 86% of our bank deposits were under the FDIC insured limits. In addition, these deposits are spread among tens of millions of investor accounts. And lastly, there are no groups of investors or advisers who directly influence or encourage collective behavior. The 10 RIA firms whose clients hold the greatest amount of cash on our bank balance sheet, account for barely 2% of total bank deposits and the average transactional cash per account for those RIA firms is less than $13,000. I hope these facts remove any concerns about some sort of ordinated action potentially happening that would meaningfully impact our bank deposits. This is a very important slide. I'd like to dive deeper into our clients' cash behaviors. I know this is a critical area of interest, particularly as it could apply to future levels of bank balance sheet cash and client cash realignments. As I've discussed in the past, when interest rates are near 0, clients tend to co-mingle their transactional cash and their longer-term investment cash together. Of course, there's very little incentive during times like that to move their investment cash into solutions that offer higher yields than bank sweep. But when interest rates rise, we reach out to clients and suggest they consider realigning their investment cash into other solutions, whatever the client sees fit, whether that would be a purchase money fund -- a purchase money market fund, a CD, a treasury security or another appropriate cash solution that the client is interested in. And of course, this has been taking place, predominantly inside Schwab, as rates have been rising over the past year or so. The rate, pace and ultimate level of this realigning has a large impact on our near-term financial results. So not surprising, we study it closely, and we have models that estimate how it will unfold. By several measures we study, we believe that this cash realigning process is now slowing and getting closer to its endpoint, which should then likely reverse to a stage where bank balance sheet cash begins to grow as a result of our organic net new asset growth as well as new accounts that we attract. Now in terms of the slide, we've included a chart that goes back to 2004, and it illustrates multiple time frames where interest rates were relatively high as well as several time frames where interest rates were near 0, often referred to as ZIRP periods. When we study this information, RIA per account basis, what we see as the most accurate way to model this. Transactional cash per account is down to an average of approximately $10,400, a level as low as we have seen in the past 20 years and down about 50% from the peak period during the COVID pandemic. From a percent standpoint, transactional cash per account is at a 20-year low of approximately 5%. Now could it go lower? Yes, of course, but we believe it is closer than ever to finding its ending point. Here's why. If you look at daily Schwab Bank cash movements, a key metric for identifying trends far more important than a quarterly summary. February of this year was lower than January. And if we adjust for the single day after the Silicon Valley Bank failure, where cash movement was modestly elevated, March was lower on a per day basis than February. And through the first half of April, even allowing for tax payments, April is also lower than March, measurably lower. Lastly, it's important to recognize that while some clients did readjust their cash allocations in response to the Silicon Valley Bank failure by buying treasuries or CDs or moving from prime money funds to treasury or government money funds, we also saw a sharp increase in new cash coming into Schwab, consistent with being a safe port in the storm. Now this slide is also a particularly important one as it provides factual information around a topic that has been fraught with inaccuracies in the press and blogs alike that incredibly to me often relied on speculative information from short sellers and competitors. Schwab Bank is a bank for investors. We manage client cash at our bank conservatively and consistently. We manage this cash in the same way we've managed it for the 20 years that we've had our bank. We make what we consider to be conservative loans, almost exclusively to our existing investment clients. Now these loans are either backed by our client securities portfolio or loans against their personal real estate. This makes up about 12% of our assets. We do not make commercial loans as speculated by one of our competitors on national television. The balance is invested primarily in securities. And with this balance, we look to manage credit risk by investing between 85% and 90% in securities backed by the U.S. government or its agencies. That's our approach to credit risk. Now let's talk about duration risk. Again, an area that has been fraught with misinformation. First, let me begin by saying it's important not to confuse as unfortunately some less than savvy alleged researchers and analysts have that maturity or weighted average life is not the same as duration. We have many floating rate securities that have a long life, but essentially zero duration and therefore, do not contribute to negative marks with higher interest rates. And of course, offer increased yields as rates rise. Second, we do not now and never have tried to guess future interest rate movements. Doing so is a fool's game. It's like trying to guess stock market movements. We don't guess and we don't try to time interest rate movements. Our approach is very straight forward. We have historically managed our bank investment portfolio to a duration range between 2.75 and 4 years. And we were approximately 3.5 years as rates began to rise in mid-2022, admittedly, nearer the higher end of our historic range than the lower end of fair criticism. Importantly, our overall duration across the firm's aggregate balance sheets, which includes the banks and the broker-dealers, was about 2.5 years. That is it, not 5, not 10, but 2.5 years. And we all know that even at 2.5 years, this is not low enough to avoid temporary paper losses when rates rise close to 500 basis points in a year. We just felt it was important to be transparent on where we were as this rising rate cycle began. So again, we did not change our historic approach during the COVID pandemic. Contrary to some items I've read and heard, we did not buy securities that would take us out of our historic duration range. But even more bluntly, we did not go out and load up our securities portfolio with long-dated bonds during the pandemic period. Now it can be a fair criticism that we should have changed our 2-decade approach to consistently maintaining a relatively short-term duration bank portfolio during the COVID pandemic in favor of holding primarily cash. That's fair to say. And if we would have known that the Federal Reserve was going to raise rates faster than they ever have in history, in retrospect, that would have been a brilliant move to make. What we did do was to begin to build up higher levels of liquid cash in late 2021 as transitory comments about inflation from the Federal Reserve waned and in early 2022 as the Federal Reserve began discussing increases in interest rates. We increased our normal cash allocation about $60 billion. But given the pace that the Federal Reserve raised rates and therefore, the pace of the resolving client cash realigning, again, in retrospect, $60 billion was not nearly enough, and that led to our need to execute on our other liquidity measures. I started my comments by making clear that our financial model and franchise strength are intact. So the obvious question is, how this manifests itself in terms of earnings growth and our ability to deliver for our stockholders? It's well understood that the temporary cost of higher funding from CDs and FHLB loans will impact our near-term revenue growth and earnings. Hopefully, it is also well understood that, as these borrowings are paid off, that will be an accelerant to our medium-term earnings. But as client cash realigning moderates and eventually reverses and the headwinds from higher cost, temporary funding sources diminishes over the next 7 quarters, what remains? What remains is an extraordinary company. We have a diverse client base spread across approximately 35 million accounts. We have a track record of delivering exceptionally strong organic asset growth in every environment. We are completing the integration of the former Ameritrade client base and adding world-class trading capabilities, along with approximately 10 million new clients, who will be exposed to all the additional products and services that Schwab offers that were not available at Ameritrade, and millions of existing Schwab clients will be exposed to the world-class retail trading platforms that were previously only available to Ameritrade clients. And as a result of the integration process winding down, along with investments that we have made in enhancing efficiency during this integration process, we will be in a position to substantially reduce operating expenses. Again, as I stated, well beyond the remaining $500 million to $600 million we originally committed to as part of the Ameritrade integration synergies. It's a powerful formula. It's a winning formula, and I'm confident that it will be a formula that delivers for our long-term stockholders, as it has since we went public in 1987. So Peter, let me turn it over to you to talk some more about our financial results and projections. Thanks, Dan. I'm going to go ahead and comment on this. So I think when you look at client cash realigning, we feel fairly confident that the metrics we've shown have good basis in history. I guess I would encourage you to think of a client cash aligning. It's an event, it's not a process. And I'm going to illustrate that by an example. If you have a retail client that has, say, build up $50,000 in cash during the pandemic period. And they look at that and say, well, I want to keep 20,000 of that liquid available for immediate trading or other uses, paying bills, they don't take that $30,000 and say, \"Well, I'm going to move $10,000 this quarter and $10,000 next quarter and then $10,000 several quarters in the future.\" It's an event. They reinvest the $30,000. And so what you generally will see is you'll see a rapid acceleration of client cash realigning early in the process of rate rise, let's call it in the first year. And then you begin to see it go the other way. And we think, as it goes the other way, it goes the other way in a relatively accelerating manner because, again, the event has occurred. The client, in my example, has moved their entire $30,000. So we understand the question. We think that the cash, as we indicated, the cash realigning process is slowing. We are very encouraged by what we see in April with measurable slowing. Again, we're looking at 3 consecutive months of declines, and we feel very good about the chart and the results we're able to share with you. Yes. Thanks, Mike. So I don't think, at this point, we're going to quantify the extent that we believe that we can generate ongoing expense saves beyond the $500 million to $600 million that we have committed to and have remaining in the integration, but we think it is substantial. And yes, it's important to keep in mind that, as we approach this integration, one of the decisions we made was that getting the integration right was our #1 priority. And therefore, we were willing to spend quite aggressively along the way to ensure that there was nothing that got in the way of ensuring the integration went as well as smoothly as it could possibly go, even if it meant ratcheting up spending to a level that was much higher than maybe we would have thought several years ago. So we have the opportunities that I mentioned, and then we have the opportunity after multiple years of allowing spending to grow relatively quickly to do a step back and evaluate it overall. And our early work gives us the confidence to say that it is meaningfully higher than the remaining synergies, but I don't think we're ready to quantify it yet. The one thing I will make clear though is, as we have done in the past when we made moves around expense that were significant, we will protect the client experience. So we will not be looking at impacting the parts of the organization that build relationships with clients that serve clients and that deliver that client experience. Thanks, Jeff, and thanks, everyone, for joining in and participating, and thanks for the feedback on the timing of this update relative to our earnings report, and please continue to provide that feedback. And we'll be -- look to be responsive to what we hear from all of you around the best time to do these updates. I think, as all of you know, I've been doing this a long time. This is my 15th year as CEO of Schwab. And during that time, I've seen a lot of different environments. Good is as well as much more difficult ones. But when I look at that history, what's consistent to me is that long-term success comes from maintaining a focus on clients. There are always going to be circumstances that come up on a periodic basis that have more of a short-term impact. And we're well aware. We're not oblivious to what's going on. We also know that we have driven much of what has gone on that has affected our near-term earnings because we've been proactively reaching out to our clients of all sizes for the last year and explaining to them the options that they should consider with their investment in cash. But again, I'd like to put this in the context of what I led with around clients. It's the right thing to do. And it's what we would do during this environment if we're faced with this environment again. We're well aware that long-term success comes from a focus on clients. And we're well aware that our bank is unique as it serves as a bank for investors. We're also well aware that as storms come, storms also go. Eventually, they come to an end. And what we know from history is that when those storms and the firms who stand tall or those who have a focus on clients. And that's something that I believe you can count on for Schwab as you have for many years in the past and can count on again in the future. Thanks again for all of your time today. We very much appreciate it, and we appreciate the thoughtful questions."

        "content": "Jeff Edwards: And we\u2019re on. Hi, Everyone, and welcome to Schwab\u2019s 2022 Fall Business Update. This is Jeff Edwards, Managing Director of Investor Relations, and I\u2019m joined today by our Co-Chairman and CEO, Walt Bettinger; President, Rick Wurster; and CFO, Peter Crawford. We have a [Texas\u2019 size] amount of ground to cover today, so I\u2019m going to do my best to not be the bottleneck here. However, I do want to cover a few items before we jump into prepared remarks. Per standard setup, I\u2019ll help moderate Q&A following management\u2019s presentation. We will be accepting questions via both the phone line and the web console for the usual. One thing that\u2019s important to note is starting with today\u2019s update, we are implementing a 1 question only, no follow-up format. However, we certainly encourage folks to jump back into the queue if additional questions come to mind. And of course, you can always check back in with IR after the session with any questions. As always, today\u2019s slides will be posted to the IR site at the start of Peter\u2019s portion of the programming. And finally, please don\u2019t forget about the enduring wall of words, which reminds us all that the future is uncertain please stay up to date with our disclosures. With that, Walt, take it away.\nWalt Bettinger: [Technical Difficulty] ...that began in 2020 and many others. And in each of these time periods, there was a list of doubters. In fact, I recently went back and read some of the reports and articles that were written about Schwab during those periods. And although I generally respect those who doubted us, I have enormous confidence in our firm and in our people. I have enormous confidence in our ability to serve our 30-million-plus clients, and enormous confidence in our ability to deliver for our long-term stockholders. As we all know, the third quarter was very difficult for investors. The Federal Reserve continued with an aggressive policy designed to battle deep-seated inflation -- they did so with steep increases in rates, and at the same time, equity markets fell for the third consecutive quarter. The S&P 500 and NASDAQ now showing year-to-date losses between 25% and 32%. And yet despite these challenging days for investing, our all-weather business model continued to prove successful. Whether we\u2019re looking at our strong organic asset growth rate of 7% reflected in $115 billion of net new assets, or the fact that our retail net new assets in the third quarter were 20% higher than the same period last year. It\u2019s clear that our Through clients\u2019 eyes strategy is working and a major contributor to our organic growth. And just as our client strategy was successful, our commitment to encouraging a long-term approach to investing was also reflected in our clients\u2019 actions. Even with investing sentiment near record lows, our clients remained resilient with net equity buys exceeding net sales. And our clients remained trusting in our advisory services with flows into these solutions in excess of $8 billion during the quarter. Now as expected in a difficult investing environment, cash is an important part of our clients\u2019 investing approach. Now this is something that we\u2019ve always known, always believed in. And as I often say, there\u2019s no investor who has ever lived through a bear market who then doubts that cash is a critical part of an asset allocation strategy. Now recently, we know there\u2019s been a lot of commentary about so-called client cash sorting. And there\u2019s been a lot of commentary as if it\u2019s some kind of bad thing or something that we didn\u2019t expect or, frankly, didn\u2019t welcome. And, to the contrary, we view it as both expected and as a positive. In fact, we put a lot of effort into helping our clients make the most of their cash. Our approach to assisting clients with our cash needs is robust and it\u2019s very focused on their needs. For example, for transactional cash, we offer competitive yields and features relative to other transaction accounts, including taking steps like pioneering fee-free ATM withdrawals worldwide. And for investment cash, we offer money market funds with low fees, CDs from banks across the country in a variety of quality fixed income investment options. Our clients\u2019 decisions with their cash are, of course, influenced by the interest rate environment. During a ZIRP or 0 interest rate environment, clients have little yield motivation to move money from a transactional category, like a bank sweep or checking, to an investment category, like a purchase money fund or a fixed income offering. And then, of course, when rates rise, it\u2019s a prudent decision for clients to make that move with their investment cash, and we encourage that. We encourage those moves. We make outbound phone calls from our financial consultants and others. We do seminars. We offer marketing that encourages clients to position their investment cash into higher-yielding alternatives. Now some might question, well, why would [we] do that? We know that we take a revenue hit with every dollar that moves, for example, from a bank sweep to a money market fund. But to those individuals who question it, I would suggest that maybe they don\u2019t really understand what we mean when we say through clients\u2019 eyes or they don\u2019t really understand our long-term horizon for growth because we proactively contact clients because it\u2019s the right thing to do. The right thing to move their investment cash into higher-yielding options. And our clients, not surprisingly, respond very favorably to our proactive efforts to show them how to increase their yields on investment cash. I guess if I were to summarize this slide, I\u2019d say that if you understand our firm, if you understand Schwab, you know we are doing exactly what you should expect us to do in the middle of a rapidly rising rate environment. And our clients are doing exactly what we expect that they would and, frankly, should do. And none of what is happening should interfere with our ability to grow our revenue and our net interest margin, and none of it should impact our ability to deliver earnings growth consistent with our financial formula over the coming quarters and years. Before I pass it over to Rick to cover some of our strategic efforts in more detail, I want to spend a couple of moments on the status of our Ameritrade integration and conversion because we\u2019re closing our second full year of preparing for conversion, and we feel very good about where we are. We have built tremendous scale and capacity, far greater than we anticipated when we announced this acquisition. We\u2019ve committed to retaining our high-end clients with capabilities that take great features from both firms, for example, from Ameritrade, things like iRebal, thinkorswim and thinkpipes. We\u2019ve worked diligently to make the actual conversion process streamlined and simple for our combined clients, along with retaining key high-quality employees, and of course, we\u2019ve done all this, as you know, in the middle of a global pandemic. When we complete this integration, we think we will be offering the industry\u2019s top overall investing experience. Of course, nothing as large and complex as this integration and conversion goes perfectly. In addition to the pandemic-related issues, which we\u2019re all familiar with, 2 additional issues are likely to push our total integration spend about 10% higher than we anticipated 18 months ago. Now the first one is probably obvious to everyone, it\u2019s inflation. Technology equipment, cloud contracts, market-driven staff compensation, all these costs more, frankly, they cost a lot more than we anticipated back in 2019 and 2020. In addition, in light of the war in the Ukraine, we made a decision, we believe a correct decision, and this is actually creating the largest reason for these higher costs and also likely to push the last conversion of somewhere around 1% or 2% of our clients back into the first part of 2024. But I want to emphasize, it will not impact the amount or timing of the expense synergies we\u2019ve committed to, and here\u2019s why. The thinkorswim system at Ameritrade relied very heavily on software developers and engineers based in Russia. Now these individuals managed the majority of the TOS system, from design to enhancement and even to ongoing daily maintenance. When the war in Ukraine began, we stopped using those Russian-based resources. This meant not only moving all of those efforts, but also training dozens and dozens of new engineers and developers on the TOS system, and this was very costly, but it was the right thing to do. And I know that anyone listening to this call would have made the exact same decision that we made. So just to sum all this up, despite the pandemic, despite record client engagement, despite the highest inflation in 40 years, despite geopolitical and market volatility, we remain on track to convert 98% to 99% of our clients in 2023, deliver on the expense synergies we committed to at the very outset, and do so with a total integration budget only modestly above our early 2021 estimates. So Rick, let me go ahead and turn it over to you to talk in more detail about some of our strategic efforts.\nRick Wurster: Thank you, Walt. Walt shared the success we\u2019re having with clients, and it starts with seeing through clients\u2019 eyes and making a difference in clients\u2019 financial lives. We continue to be guided by our through clients\u2019 eyes approach and have additional opportunities to expand how we help clients. We are currently focused on 3 strategic focus areas: scale and efficiency, win-win monetization and client segmentation. Within scale and efficiency, Walt just shared an update on our firm\u2019s #1 priority, integration. As part of the integration, we\u2019ve accelerated investments in technology and the client experience to make it even easier for clients to do business with us. Seeing through clients\u2019 eyes by making it easier to invest and build wealth has been a hallmark of both Schwab and Ameritrade. Our ongoing efforts to enhance experiences for our clients and our field will continue to be a key differentiator. I\u2019ll spend our time today going into more detail on 3 opportunities: wealth management, lending and our RIA client segment. We said it before, and it remains true today, we are bullish on advice. Although investor sentiment has fallen in this current market environment, our clients are still highly engaged in our wealth and advice solutions and flows continue to be strong. I\u2019ve spoken in prior quarters about how Schwab is uniquely positioned to deliver a continuum of wealth management experiences to meet a range of client needs. On one end of the continuum, we offer clients access to investment solutions they can use for part of their portfolios. The acquisitions -- acquisition of Wasmer Schroeder Strategies is a clear example of a win-win opportunity for both clients and our firm. We brought down the cost of access to fixed income managed accounts on our platform and flows have moved to Schwab. The strategies have attracted over $5 billion in net flows over the last 2 years. This includes $1 billion in net flows in the third quarter alone, the highest quarterly net flows we\u2019ve seen since launching these strategies on the retail platform in January of \u201821. Another investment solution I\u2019ll highlight briefly is Schwab Personalized Indexing. We are still in the early days, and our efforts are focused on educating clients in the field about the potential benefits direct indexing can provide. We expect it will grow more rapidly as clients continue to learn about it. Moving along the continuum, we\u2019re also meeting client needs with our 2 full-service wealth offerings, Schwab Wealth Advisory and Schwab Advisor Network, or SAN. Despite a challenging market environment, clients are highly engaged. Both Schwab Wealth Advisory and SAN attracted strong quarterly net flows in the third quarter at $2.6 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively. This is an opportunity for win-win monetization as it is an area where we are investing in the client experience and have several levers to improve our economics. First, we believe there\u2019s an opportunity to attract more clients to the programs, particularly at Ameritrade, where less than 7% of assets are engaged in advice, and we have already seen 40% of Ameritrade FCs enroll a client in Schwab Wealth Advisory and over 80% of Ameritrade FCs have enrolled a client in some form of Schwab Advice. Second, we believe we can increase flows into Schwab Wealth Advisory through continuing to enhance the program for clients and making it easier for our field to use. Third, we are reviewing our SAN program economics to make sure we are capturing our fair share given the value Schwab brings to the program, including our track record of successful new client acquisition, our sustained marketing investment, our brand and the important role our field plays in the process and with clients. Schwab Wealth Advisory consistently has the highest Client Promoter Scores at the firm, and we are investing in the program to make sure it remains that way and increases its growth. As I\u2019ve shared previously, we are adding to our capacity to sustain growth, training advisers in new ways to add to the wealth expertise we\u2019re bringing to clients and making investments in the sales team that supports this offer. We\u2019re enhancing the client experience, including making it easier to access our supporting expert teams and beginning to add to our digital experiences. And we are expanding our capabilities, and, over time, plan to provide a discretionary wealth management experience. We believe that demand for advice will continue to increase, and we expect to see growth in both Schwab Wealth Advisory and SAN. With through clients\u2019 eyes as our North Star, we want to make sure that no matter what type of advice and investor needs that we can connect them with the right model. When we think about long-term growth, we believe lending is a win-win opportunity as well. We know that retail clients want to consolidate as much of their financial lives as possible in one place. We know that RIAs want to reduce the number of relationships their clients need to have with financial institutions. Clients who do their borrowing at Schwab today are delighted by our competitive rates, and our Client Promoter Scores exemplify that. And with a large balance sheet, this is a productive use of capital for us. With our lending offer, we are making investments today, so we can be the preferred lending provider for clients on our platform. We introduced a preferred rate program, and we are enhancing the digital experience. We are building out our service teams to provide more tailored service, akin to what you might see at the largest banks or wealth firms. In the third quarter, we expanded the rollout of the ultra-high net worth senior lending team model to 6 more retail regions in preparation for full retail rollout by the end of the year. In the last quarter, we started to train and license more than 600 Ameritrade FCs so they can offer PAL and mortgage loans to their clients. We\u2019ve also seen increased retail FC adoption of lending despite rising rates. And we\u2019ve partnered with adviser services to help onboard some significant new RIAs with billions in assets through our lending capabilities. These efforts have been met with very positive feedback. Even in a difficult lending environment, we are seeing growth. PAL demand continues to grow, it is up 31% compared to last year because demand is driven by factors outside of the rate cycle. As we continue to build out the offer for the future, we will take the no trade-offs approach to lending that clients expect from Schwab, attractive rates, enhanced digital experiences and a tailored service model. As we\u2019ve shared previously, about 2% of retail clients turned to Schwab for their borrowing needs. We see about the same level of utilization among RIA clients as well. We believe there is an attractive amount of potential upside here. Now let\u2019s turn to client segmentation. We are continuing to enhance and expand the services and solutions that we offer to our RIA client segment. Expanding our institutional no transaction fee or INTF mutual fund offering for RIAs who [custody] at Schwab and Ameritrade, makes us even more attractive. Earlier this month, we added more than 800 institutional funds without a transaction fee from 15 leading third-party asset managers. This is in addition to over 130 funds already available through our strategic relationship with T. Rowe Price. We\u2019re thrilled to offer this expanded lineup to advisers. With more choices for low-cost share classes without a transaction fee, RIAs can personalize their clients\u2019 investment portfolios and put more of their clients\u2019 initial investments to work. It is a win for RIAs and their clients, and it is a win for us at Schwab. As I look at opportunities on the horizon, our through clients\u2019 eyes approach continues to be both our North Star and our winning strategy. Clients are continuing to turn to Schwab, and they remain engaged despite economic uncertainty. This challenging environment reinforces the importance of our strategy and delivering on our strategic priorities. I\u2019m energized by the momentum we\u2019ve built. By continuing to keep clients at the forefront of everything we do, I\u2019m confident that Schwab remains well positioned to capitalize on the key opportunities ahead of us. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Peter.\nPeter Crawford: All right. Well, thank you very much, Rick. So you all had a chance to hear Walt and Rick talk about our through clients\u2019 eyes strategy continues to resonate with investors despite the challenging environment and very low investor sentiment, how our cash strategy is consistent with that strategy, the progress we\u2019re making with the Ameritrade acquisition in spite of a number of unforeseen challenges and how we\u2019re continuing to advance our appropriately ambitious strategic agenda. In my time today, I\u2019ll talk about how the combination of strong business momentum and rising interest rates overcame a tough equity market and more bearish investor sentiment to produce yet another quarter of record financial performance. I\u2019ll also provide an updated outlook for the rest of the year. And finally, I\u2019ll talk about how we\u2019re confident we will navigate through this environment and continue producing strong financial performance in the quarters and years ahead. What should hopefully become clear is that we\u2019re certainly benefiting from higher rates and are poised to benefit even more in the quarters and years ahead, even as we take steps to manage through some of the speed bumps that those higher rates present. But those speed bumps are quite manageable, which means that the most important factor in our long-term success is the strength of our business and our through clients\u2019 eyes strategy, something that\u2019s producing strong momentum and positioning us to continue thriving even after rates eventually normalize. Let\u2019s talk about some of the factors that contributed to our record financial performance in the third quarter. Compared to the second quarter, we faced more headwinds than tailwinds with equity markets down and the resulting bearish investor sentiment weighing on trading activity and margin utilization. We did, of course, benefit from rates that continue to increase across the curve. Now in spite of the volatile market, we\u2019ve been able to continue driving strong organic growth. Roughly $300 billion in core net new assets in the first 9 months of the year despite record high tax payments by clients, and an average of over 1 million new accounts per quarter. Despite these headwinds, our financial performance in the third quarter broke multiple records. Revenue increased 20% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, driven by a 44% increase in net interest revenue, reflecting higher interest-earning assets, and a 52-basis-point increase in our net interest margin year-over-year to 197 basis points, which was also up 35 basis points sequentially. That more than offset a decline in asset management and admin fees due to falling equity markets. Adjusted expenses were up 12% year-over-year, consistent with our expectations given higher head count and the 5% across-the-board salary increase we implemented late last year. And we increased our adjusted pretax margin to 53% and produced a record at $1.10 in adjusted EPS. Bank deposits were down 10% sequentially due to client cash allocation decisions that were broadly consistent with our expectations given the dramatic increase in rates. The decline in stockholders\u2019 equity was the product of unrealized mark-to-market losses in our available-for-sale portfolio as well as $1.5 billion of common share buybacks and the redemption of our $400 million Series A preferred. And despite that nearly $2 billion of capital return, our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio finished above our operating objective. Despite the challenging equity markets, we feel very confident about our ability to continue driving strong revenue growth even as we maintain a high level of capital return. Assuming the Fed funds rate exits 2022 at 4.5%, we\u2019d expect to produce an 11% to 13% year-over-year increase in revenue, consistent with the scenario we shared earlier. That reflects continued expansion of our net interest margin to the mid-210s in Q4, a roughly 10% to 12% decline in average interest-earning assets from December 2021 to December 2022, and net interest revenue higher than Q3 despite continued client cash allocations decisions and some limited and temporary borrowing from the FHLB to fund some of those outflows. We have taken steps to limit expense growth, and we now expect full year expense growth to be on the lower end of the 7% to 8% range we communicated a few months ago. Looking ahead to 2023, we continue to see no reason that the magnitude of client cash sorting will be dramatically different than the last rising rate cycle, suggesting balances trough at some point next year. We have ample sources of liquidity to support our clients and anticipate growth in both net interest margin and net interest revenue from Q4 of this year to Q4 of next year and beyond. And of course, you can expect that the higher pace of capital return we started in Q3 will continue. There\u2019s obviously been a lot of commentary, perhaps too much on the topic of client cash sorting. And we continue to receive a lot of questions. I want to emphasize that this is a dynamic, which we view as very much temporary, quite manageable and not a factor in our long-term performance. I want to reiterate a few high-level observations regarding our current beliefs around sorting, with additional detail in the appendix, which you\u2019re welcome to discuss with the IR team after the call. Now we have broken these into 2 categories regarding the pace of sorting and the ultimate magnitude of sorting. First, we have extensive data that suggests that the rate we pay on transactional cash has little or no impact on the pace or magnitude of sorting. So you\u2019re not going to see us change our sweep deposit pricing philosophy to catch up or to influence client behavior. Second, we\u2019ve also seen from experience, and it\u2019s consistent with intuition, that the pace of client cash reallocations decreases once the Fed stops hiking rates. Third, we have seen over time that clients seek to maintain a minimum level of transactional or sweep cash in their account. And as we reach that point, any remaining client cash sorting is offset by organic cash inflows to both new and existing accounts. Fourth, higher cash balance accounts tend to move earliest, and we\u2019ve already seen them decrease their activity. And fifth, and finally, our client base today has a higher mix of clients who tend to maintain higher -- relative levels of transactional cash. Put all that together, and we are confident that the activity we\u2019re seeing will abate. And as we said in our recent CFO commentary, we believe we\u2019re now in the middle innings of this process. There\u2019s also been a lot of speculation about actions we may need to take to support these client cash allocation decisions. So we thought it would be helpful to share a few facts. First, we have access to roughly $100 billion to $150 billion of readily available cash over the next 15 months. Roughly half of that from excess cash on hand or that the investment portfolio will generate, and the other half from cash that comes in through our net new assets. Second, we also have access to a very large amount of funding from the FHLB, from retail CDs we\u2019re looking to offer, and various forms of supplemental funding. In the last 2 weeks, we initiated borrowings from the FHLB of roughly $10 billion. We expect the usage of these to be quite limited, perhaps no more than a mid-single-digit percent of our liabilities and quite temporary. But the capacity to do more and for a longer period of time is certainly there. So any potential asset sales we do are likely to be very limited and opportunistic. It\u2019s really important to recognize that even after we reach peak rates this cycle, we have the ability to continue expanding our net interest margin over the following years as our fixed investment portfolio rolls over. And this NIM expansion would be additive to the through-the-cycle financial formula we have delivered over the years and expect to continue moving forward. I don\u2019t think I need to spend much time on capital return. We\u2019ve been certainly discussing for a while our expectation for a higher level of capital return, and you saw that begin in the third quarter. Before I close, I want to pull out from some of our near-term dynamics and remind everyone about that through-the-cycle financial formula, which has worked over multiple decades, and we\u2019d expect to continue working in the decades ahead. It\u2019s built on our through clients\u2019 eyes strategy and no trade-offs positioning leading to consistent organic growth. And then even as we worked our way through multiple rate cycles, made disruptive moves like cutting equity commissions to 0 and acquiring Ameritrade, we\u2019ve been able to convert that strong organic growth into asset growth, revenue growth and through ongoing expense discipline, expanding margins and EPS growth over 20%. That has been the investment thesis for Schwab for much of our history, and it continues to be the same today. We were speaking with a member of the investment community last week who said this last quarter demonstrated our ability to \"walk and chew gum at the same time.\" He was referring to our ability to grow top line revenue and deliver capital return at the same time. And while we\u2019d argue that this feed is a bit more difficult for most firms to achieve and that well-worn analogy would suggest he is right, that is exactly what we expect of ourselves. But equally notable is our ability this quarter -- this year to both help our clients and our business navigate this extraordinary environment, while, at the same time, taking the steps necessary to drive long-term operating and financial performance. And as I noted previously, in the last 20 years, we have been through 2 full rate cycles, down, up, down, up. On the way down, we get asked about capital and premium amortization. On the way up, we\u2019re asked about liquidity and sorting. But meanwhile, amidst all these questions, the Schwab engine keeps chugging along, adding clients, finding new revenue opportunities, driving greater efficiency, returning capital to stockholders, growing earnings power, rewarding those stockholders who have a long-term orientation, and I am confident that all of those components will be part of our story this cycle. Jeff, let me turn it over to you for Q&A.\nJeff Edwards: Great. Operator, can we please go ahead and go to the first question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.\nKen Worthington: On win-win monetization, as these programs that you have in place season, so just the existing ones you have, what do you think that could add to revenue as it season sort of annually? And then on the 800 funds, as that -- how much in AUM do those 800 funds have on the platform right now? And how quickly do you expect that to ramp into the fee-free institutional offering?\nWalt Bettinger: Ken, thanks for the question. So in terms of win-win monetization opportunities, we believe we have a lot of upside. I mean both wealth management and lending, 2 examples of programs that we\u2019re focused on today. We think there\u2019s enormous upside there. And I shared some of the levers we\u2019re trying to pull on wealth. And in lending, of course, we think we\u2019ll see more of the upside when we get back into a more normalized interest rate environment. But essentially, what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve set the table. We\u2019ve created the digital experiences, the product capabilities, and we\u2019ve educated our field to be ready to engage clients in those discussions. And so when the interest rate environment becomes more favorable, we expect there to be benefits there. When we think about personalized indexing, which is another one of the programs we\u2019ve talked about for a while, we expect that to be a 10-year ride of money moving from active strategies and some taxable assets that are in taxable ETFs to move in there. So we think there\u2019s a long runway to all 3 of these programs that we think will provide meaningful upside in the coming years. As it relates to the INTF platform, it is very new. We are seeing assets flow there. And our expectation there, of course, is also strong. I think part of what we\u2019re seeing, or part of the challenge broadly, whether it\u2019s INTF or our relationship with T. Rowe Price is it\u2019s just it\u2019s been a difficult time for active management. And so that\u2019s one that we believe over the long run, again, we\u2019ll pay dividends, but it will, in part, depend on it being an environment where active management is in favor.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler.\nRich Repetto: First, thanks, Walt, for emphasizing the long-term franchise value related to cash allocation. That\u2019s a helpful reminder for us. I guess my question would be, Peter, as you offered some reasons why you thought that cash sorting had reached the middle innings, and why you won\u2019t -- it won\u2019t exceed the last cycle? Can you put any numbers behind that? And maybe a little bit more detail on why you expect that? And is it do -- well, that would be the question, I guess.\nPeter Crawford: Thank you, Rick -- Rich, for the question. So we have some details in the appendix, which you can certainly reference and I encourage you to follow up with the IR team to -- if you want more explanation on those. But it really comes back to a number of different factors that contribute to that view. It comes back to the fundamentals of our cash strategy. We look at the evidence from what we\u2019ve seen in the empirical experience that we have from the last rising rate cycles. We look at the dynamics we see with the -- what we\u2019re seeing thus far, which are fitting the patterns that we\u2019ve seen in that prior rate cycle. In fact, I was looking at a -- some model output just the other day that suggested that what we\u2019ve seen thus far is entirely consistent with what we saw in the last rising rate cycle when you control for the fact that the rates have moved up much more quickly than they did that last cycle. So we\u2019re really not seeing anything that is shaking our view that this is proceeding exactly how we would anticipate.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDan Fannon: I wanted to follow up on that just with regards to the funding of some of the sorting, and you talked about utilizing the FHLB line, but I think you also said that will be short term. So thinking about the access that you have, the capital and the uses, what gives you confidence that you\u2019re not going to need to tap into that for longer periods?\nPeter Crawford: So it comes back to our view on when the we\u2019ve seen over time that these client cash allocation decisions at level of transactional cash reaches a certain floor, and as it starts to approach that floor, it starts to taper up -- the allocation start to taper off and then it\u2019s offset by cash that comes in through new accounts. And so we view -- our view is that, that\u2019s going to trough at some point in 2023. And then as new cash comes in, we\u2019ll be able to reduce the use of the FHLB and any retail CD offers that we have or any other forms of funding that we access.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: So, Peter, I wanted to ask a question on capital. You\u2019ve announced a large buyback authorization. As you\u2019ve noted, under your binding regulatory constraint of Tier 1 leverage, you\u2019re already in an excess position, but your TCE ratio is running at low levels, largely a function of negative AOCI marks, but it\u2019s prompted questions as to whether you\u2019re a lower TCE might preclude buyback. If it turns negative, it could even preclude tapping of the FHLB facility. So to what extent does the TCE ratio impact your ability to execute buybacks or tapping the FHLB? And how should we think about your philosophy around optimizing capital ratios to ensure you\u2019re not running with too much excess?\nPeter Crawford: Yes. Thanks for the question. So I think I said last time in the business update that our AOCI was not at all a factor in our capital planning decisions and that remains the case. We\u2019re -- I would say that the idea of negative TCE or something like that is not at all a major source of concern. We actually are now in the process of transferring additional securities from available for sale to held to maturity. And as we do that, it would take an instantaneous several hundred basis point increase in rates for our tangible common equity to go negative, which certainly this seems like a very remote possibility. And given the fact that the duration on that available-for-sale portfolio is under 3.5 that amortizes down relatively quickly. So, over time, it would take even a larger increase in interest rates for TCE to go negative. And while you\u2019re right that negative TCE means that prevents us from initiating new borrowings from the FHLB without Fed approval, it doesn\u2019t affect existing borrowings. It also doesn\u2019t affect any of the other forms of funding that I talked about, the CDs or some of the other forms of funding. So we really don\u2019t think that this is a meaningful issue or a meaningful concern.\nSteven Chubak: And optimizing the buybacks, sorry?\nPeter Crawford: Sorry, and on the buybacks, I think no change in our thinking on the buybacks. We still -- as you point out, if AOCI is not part of our regulatory capital. That is what we manage to. And we continue to -- as we\u2019ve seen in Q3, continue to pursue the opportunistic return of capital to our stockholders.\nJeff Edwards: Let\u2019s take a question from the web console. This is from Ben Budish at Barclays. Walt, maybe you can take this. Can you speak a little bit to the pipeline for new RIAs coming in? And if we should think about any -- how the integration and conversion might factor into that [train] going forward?\nWalt Bettinger: Sure. Thanks, Ben, for the question. We -- I was actually just looking at a report on pipeline for new RIAs moving independent, and those numbers remain very robust. They are on par with what we have seen over recent quarters. Actually, if I were to think about a slowdown in RIAs moving into the independent model, I wouldn\u2019t think of it correlated to integration. I would think of it more correlated to the market environment. And that\u2019s what I was interested in when I actually asked this exact question myself a week or so ago to see whether the equity market declined had made it less apt for RIAs to consider moving to independents. And the fact that the pipeline was comparable to what it\u2019s been over recent quarters actually was very encouraging to me. So I guess, in summary, I would say I would not expect the integration to have an impact on breakaways, but I do think you have to watch the equity markets because, over time, it can be more difficult for someone to break away when they\u2019re asking their clients to follow them after a period in which the equity markets have suffered as much as they have of late.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: Just another one on the balance sheet, so I understand. So the $10 billion in FHLB, does that provide liquidity for additional cash sorting from here, so you\u2019re getting ahead of something? Or is that just meeting kind of what you\u2019ve seen thus far? Just trying to understand the strategy around that. And then any help that you can provide just thinking about the kind of the blended borrowing cost to get to the $3 billion in NIR, and how you\u2019re thinking about deposit beta on future Fed hikes?\nPeter Crawford: Yes. So this may be one where we want to take this offline and have a conversation with the IR team around going through those costs, Devin. But the FHLB borrowing was a bit to cover some of what we\u2019ve seen thus far in October and also a bit to get ahead of it. We always want to be ahead of the game around from a liquidity standpoint. And then in terms of the cost and all that, we can get into that in more detail offline with the IR team.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW.\nKyle Voigt: Maybe just a follow-up on the disclosure of the $100 billion to $150 billion of cash flows that are available from cash on hand, cash from NNA and the portfolio cash flows. I guess, given the current pace of sorting, I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more granularity on some of those buckets. So what was the -- the current excess cash on hand on the balance sheet as of the third quarter? And then maybe over the next 12-month period, what percentage of the securities portfolio would you expect to mature, or even given that in dollar terms would also be very helpful?\nJeff Edwards: Kyle, it\u2019s Jeff. Definitely happy to follow up with you kind of after the call on some of those more tactical questions. I definitely would point to the appendix and some of the things we\u2019ve talked about and has good directional proxies on that. But again, we\u2019re happy to take that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Maybe looking longer term in the development of the NIM that you talked about, Peter, [indiscernible]. How are you thinking about potentially protecting that in the future? I know this is a little bit well out in the future. But if we have a situation for whatever reason that the Fed really pulls back on rate cuts at some point in the future, is there a way to either naturally hedge that in the -- with the securities portfolio reinvestments? Or would you consider using derivatives to lock in some of the benefit of the rate increases that we\u2019ve been -- that we\u2019ve recently had?\nPeter Crawford: It\u2019s an interesting question. So I\u2019d say a couple of things. We -- the way we think about managing the duration on the asset side of the equation is really very much an outcome of what we view as the liability duration. And in different rate environments, of course, that liability duration changes. So in a higher rate environment, liability duration shrinks. And so on the margin, you tend to shrink your asset duration and reverse is obviously true. We do -- we have recently resumed the capability to have derivatives. We\u2019re not thinking about that in the context necessarily of hedging sort of downside risk, but we see that as -- sometimes, in some cases, a more efficient way to manage our overall asset duration. I would say that -- so I don\u2019t think -- I wouldn\u2019t anticipate a dramatic change in our philosophy of than what we have done previously. And there\u2019s certainly no assumption in that chart that you saw there that we shared any assumption there that we manage our investing philosophy differently than what in the past.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Credit Suisse.\nBill Katz: I think I\u2019ll switch up the topic here a little bit, and maybe we can talk a little bit out expense outlook. So Walt, you mentioned a little bit of inflation on some of the integration charges. And then Peter, you sort of took down the guidance to the low end of the range for the fourth quarter, which is great to see. Looking into 2023 and thinking about incremental margin on the revenue growth coming off of NII and some of these inflationary type of factors. How should we think about maybe core expense growth for \u201823, maybe even to \u201824%, particularly as you get a greater line of sight to residual savings with the Ameritrade integration?\nPeter Crawford: Thank you. Thanks, Bill. So if I tell you everything about expenses, now you won\u2019t come to the winter business update in February. So I want to make sure -- I want to know, in all seriousness, we\u2019re still working through our expense planning for 2023 and certainly 2024. I would say maybe a couple of things. First, maybe to take a step back, I mean, our #1 priority from an expense standpoint is always to support our clients. And this is a time period where our clients certainly need us. Beyond that, our priorities are really around driving down expense on client assets and through the cycle, not every year, but through the cycle, delivering operating leverage, which is a key part of our financial formula. And then, of course, making appropriate investments in the long-term profitable growth of our business. It\u2019s certainly a -- it\u2019s a delicate balance to manage all 3, but I think you\u2019ve seen us do that in the past. When times are -- when we\u2019re facing more headwinds and tailwinds, we tend to pull back on that third one, and when we got the wind at our backs, we tend to lean a little bit more into some of those longer-term investments. In terms of the -- as you think about 2024, Walt talked about this, but maybe just to reiterate it on the expense there is really no changes in our thinking around expense -- or expectations around expense synergies. Certainly the magnitude of those synergies, we continue to be very committed to and confident in our ability to deliver on those. We\u2019d expect, by the end of this year, we\u2019ll probably have achieved, on a run rate basis, roughly 60%, 65% of those expense synergies. And then with the integration time line that Walt talked about, we would expect to deliver the vast majority of those remaining synergies by the end of 2024.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: I was just hoping you could update us on the securities portfolio, reinvestment strategy and yields? How is that evolving? And it also looked like duration on the portfolio shortened a little bit. So I was hoping you could unpack some of the moving pieces that drove that? As rates did increase, do you feel like at this point, the book has sort of fully extended? And how do you think about any sort of risk of additional extension risk from here?\nPeter Crawford: So from a reinvestment rate standpoint, we are focused on cash right now and maintaining cash. There\u2019s not much reinvestment going on. On duration, you\u2019re absolutely right. Actually, despite the significant increase in rates across the curve in the last quarter, our duration on our investment portfolio actually shrank by a 10th, so we went from roughly [4.1] to a little under [4]. And that reflects the types of securities that we have purchased that we really very much target securities that don\u2019t have that degree of extension risks. So we feel really good about that. If you look at actually, there\u2019s a chart in the appendix, I encourage you to take a look at, that looks at the duration profile of our portfolio over time versus what you see in the some of the benchmarks. So we feel very, very good about the lack of duration extension risk in the portfolio.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: I just would like to maybe dig in a little bit on your current understanding that the situation is fluid. But -- and thanks for the incremental $10 billion so far borrowing on FHLB and the color around that. Where do you think that, that would peak out? I\u2019d assume, given the pace we\u2019re running at and the fact that you don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see any worse experience than what we saw last cycle, we\u2019re not very far from that period. And so is embedded within your guidance that the FHLB will ramp up into the beginning of next year and then be paid down as you hit that plateau, and you see cash begin to grow normally and then it\u2019s off the balance sheet by the end of the year. Is that what\u2019s reflected, or could you give a little color around what your expectations are for that funding?\nPeter Crawford: Sure. So I mean the important point is we definitely view this as very much a temporary funding source as it has been in the past. We\u2019ve used FHLB previously as a temporary funding source, and we absolutely view it the same way today. I mentioned earlier that we would expect it to be no higher than a mid-single-digit percent of our overall interest-earning assets, and that -- to be clear, that is the combination of FHLB as well as these other funding sources like CD issuance and so forth. And given our expectations that the client cash balances on the balance sheet trough at some point in 2023, that would be the period where we\u2019d be at the peak level. And then as we get to the cash balances grow that, that replaces the higher cost, but -- temporary higher cost, but temporary FHLB, CDs, et cetera, which, again, is helpful from a -- clearly, from a NIM standpoint as we start to pay those balances off and replace them with the client cash balances.\nBrennan Hawken: Great. Just one quick follow-up. The CDs, is there any term or yes...\nJeff Edwards: Just remember, just one thing and Peter\u2019s CFO commentary, right, he talked about a percentage that he thought might be appropriate through the remainder of the cycle. So that\u2019s definitely a good aiming point. And we aren\u2019t accepting follow-ups. So I think we are it looks like the queue is now empty. So I\u2019ll turn it over to Walt to take us home.\nWalt Bettinger: Thanks again, Jeff. And I want to thank everyone for joining us today. Today is actually a special day, an important milestone. As many of you know, our own Rich Fowler, he of the top-down days, this is his last quarter as Head of Investor Relations. My understanding is he\u2019s going to sprint off into retirement. Those of you who know Rich, know that he was a college level sprinter, which is no surprise to any of us who know Rich, but he\u2019s going to sprint off into retirement. Rich is the only CIRO that we have ever had at Schwab. That\u2019s pretty remarkable. He\u2019s been here through 3 CFOs, over 100 quarterly earnings cycles. But when I think of Rich, the things that stand out are his integrity, clarity, transparency, whether it\u2019s disclosures, interactions with all of you, incredibly special. And as great of a CIRO as he is, he is an even better person. We\u2019re going to miss you, Rich. You\u2019ve done a wonderful job of preparing Jeff and team to step into your shoes. And I just -- and speaking directly to Rich, want him to rest assured that the priorities and values that he\u2019s embodied at Schwab will continue long after he has crossed the next finish line in his sprint. So thanks again, Rich, and thanks to all of you for joining us, and we look forward to speaking with you again in a future business update. Bye-bye.",

            "name": "Peter Crawford",
            "content": "All right. Well, thank you very much, Rick. So you all had a chance to hear Walt and Rick talk about our through clients' eyes strategy continues to resonate with investors despite the challenging environment and very low investor sentiment, how our cash strategy is consistent with that strategy, the progress we're making with the Ameritrade acquisition in spite of a number of unforeseen challenges and how we're continuing to advance our appropriately ambitious strategic agenda. In my time today, I'll talk about how the combination of strong business momentum and rising interest rates overcame a tough equity market and more bearish investor sentiment to produce yet another quarter of record financial performance. I'll also provide an updated outlook for the rest of the year. And finally, I'll talk about how we're confident we will navigate through this environment and continue producing strong financial performance in the quarters and years ahead. What should hopefully become clear is that we're certainly benefiting from higher rates and are poised to benefit even more in the quarters and years ahead, even as we take steps to manage through some of the speed bumps that those higher rates present. But those speed bumps are quite manageable, which means that the most important factor in our long-term success is the strength of our business and our through clients' eyes strategy, something that's producing strong momentum and positioning us to continue thriving even after rates eventually normalize. Let's talk about some of the factors that contributed to our record financial performance in the third quarter. Compared to the second quarter, we faced more headwinds than tailwinds with equity markets down and the resulting bearish investor sentiment weighing on trading activity and margin utilization. We did, of course, benefit from rates that continue to increase across the curve. Now in spite of the volatile market, we've been able to continue driving strong organic growth. Roughly $300 billion in core net new assets in the first 9 months of the year despite record high tax payments by clients, and an average of over 1 million new accounts per quarter. Despite these headwinds, our financial performance in the third quarter broke multiple records. Revenue increased 20% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, driven by a 44% increase in net interest revenue, reflecting higher interest-earning assets, and a 52-basis-point increase in our net interest margin year-over-year to 197 basis points, which was also up 35 basis points sequentially. That more than offset a decline in asset management and admin fees due to falling equity markets. Adjusted expenses were up 12% year-over-year, consistent with our expectations given higher head count and the 5% across-the-board salary increase we implemented late last year. And we increased our adjusted pretax margin to 53% and produced a record at $1.10 in adjusted EPS. Bank deposits were down 10% sequentially due to client cash allocation decisions that were broadly consistent with our expectations given the dramatic increase in rates. The decline in stockholders' equity was the product of unrealized mark-to-market losses in our available-for-sale portfolio as well as $1.5 billion of common share buybacks and the redemption of our $400 million Series A preferred. And despite that nearly $2 billion of capital return, our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio finished above our operating objective. Despite the challenging equity markets, we feel very confident about our ability to continue driving strong revenue growth even as we maintain a high level of capital return. Assuming the Fed funds rate exits 2022 at 4.5%, we'd expect to produce an 11% to 13% year-over-year increase in revenue, consistent with the scenario we shared earlier. That reflects continued expansion of our net interest margin to the mid-210s in Q4, a roughly 10% to 12% decline in average interest-earning assets from December 2021 to December 2022, and net interest revenue higher than Q3 despite continued client cash allocations decisions and some limited and temporary borrowing from the FHLB to fund some of those outflows. We have taken steps to limit expense growth, and we now expect full year expense growth to be on the lower end of the 7% to 8% range we communicated a few months ago. Looking ahead to 2023, we continue to see no reason that the magnitude of client cash sorting will be dramatically different than the last rising rate cycle, suggesting balances trough at some point next year. We have ample sources of liquidity to support our clients and anticipate growth in both net interest margin and net interest revenue from Q4 of this year to Q4 of next year and beyond. And of course, you can expect that the higher pace of capital return we started in Q3 will continue. There's obviously been a lot of commentary, perhaps too much on the topic of client cash sorting. And we continue to receive a lot of questions. I want to emphasize that this is a dynamic, which we view as very much temporary, quite manageable and not a factor in our long-term performance. I want to reiterate a few high-level observations regarding our current beliefs around sorting, with additional detail in the appendix, which you're welcome to discuss with the IR team after the call. Now we have broken these into 2 categories regarding the pace of sorting and the ultimate magnitude of sorting. First, we have extensive data that suggests that the rate we pay on transactional cash has little or no impact on the pace or magnitude of sorting. So you're not going to see us change our sweep deposit pricing philosophy to catch up or to influence client behavior. Second, we've also seen from experience, and it's consistent with intuition, that the pace of client cash reallocations decreases once the Fed stops hiking rates. Third, we have seen over time that clients seek to maintain a minimum level of transactional or sweep cash in their account. And as we reach that point, any remaining client cash sorting is offset by organic cash inflows to both new and existing accounts. Fourth, higher cash balance accounts tend to move earliest, and we've already seen them decrease their activity. And fifth, and finally, our client base today has a higher mix of clients who tend to maintain higher -- relative levels of transactional cash. Put all that together, and we are confident that the activity we're seeing will abate. And as we said in our recent CFO commentary, we believe we're now in the middle innings of this process. There's also been a lot of speculation about actions we may need to take to support these client cash allocation decisions. So we thought it would be helpful to share a few facts. First, we have access to roughly $100 billion to $150 billion of readily available cash over the next 15 months. Roughly half of that from excess cash on hand or that the investment portfolio will generate, and the other half from cash that comes in through our net new assets. Second, we also have access to a very large amount of funding from the FHLB, from retail CDs we're looking to offer, and various forms of supplemental funding. In the last 2 weeks, we initiated borrowings from the FHLB of roughly $10 billion. We expect the usage of these to be quite limited, perhaps no more than a mid-single-digit percent of our liabilities and quite temporary. But the capacity to do more and for a longer period of time is certainly there. So any potential asset sales we do are likely to be very limited and opportunistic. It's really important to recognize that even after we reach peak rates this cycle, we have the ability to continue expanding our net interest margin over the following years as our fixed investment portfolio rolls over. And this NIM expansion would be additive to the through-the-cycle financial formula we have delivered over the years and expect to continue moving forward. I don't think I need to spend much time on capital return. We've been certainly discussing for a while our expectation for a higher level of capital return, and you saw that begin in the third quarter. Before I close, I want to pull out from some of our near-term dynamics and remind everyone about that through-the-cycle financial formula, which has worked over multiple decades, and we'd expect to continue working in the decades ahead. It's built on our through clients' eyes strategy and no trade-offs positioning leading to consistent organic growth. And then even as we worked our way through multiple rate cycles, made disruptive moves like cutting equity commissions to 0 and acquiring Ameritrade, we've been able to convert that strong organic growth into asset growth, revenue growth and through ongoing expense discipline, expanding margins and EPS growth over 20%. That has been the investment thesis for Schwab for much of our history, and it continues to be the same today. We were speaking with a member of the investment community last week who said this last quarter demonstrated our ability to \"walk and chew gum at the same time.\" He was referring to our ability to grow top line revenue and deliver capital return at the same time. And while we'd argue that this feed is a bit more difficult for most firms to achieve and that well-worn analogy would suggest he is right, that is exactly what we expect of ourselves. But equally notable is our ability this quarter -- this year to both help our clients and our business navigate this extraordinary environment, while, at the same time, taking the steps necessary to drive long-term operating and financial performance. And as I noted previously, in the last 20 years, we have been through 2 full rate cycles, down, up, down, up. On the way down, we get asked about capital and premium amortization. On the way up, we're asked about liquidity and sorting. But meanwhile, amidst all these questions, the Schwab engine keeps chugging along, adding clients, finding new revenue opportunities, driving greater efficiency, returning capital to stockholders, growing earnings power, rewarding those stockholders who have a long-term orientation, and I am confident that all of those components will be part of our story this cycle. Jeff, let me turn it over to you for Q&A. Thank you, Rick -- Rich, for the question. So we have some details in the appendix, which you can certainly reference and I encourage you to follow up with the IR team to -- if you want more explanation on those. But it really comes back to a number of different factors that contribute to that view. It comes back to the fundamentals of our cash strategy. We look at the evidence from what we've seen in the empirical experience that we have from the last rising rate cycles. We look at the dynamics we see with the -- what we're seeing thus far, which are fitting the patterns that we've seen in that prior rate cycle. In fact, I was looking at a -- some model output just the other day that suggested that what we've seen thus far is entirely consistent with what we saw in the last rising rate cycle when you control for the fact that the rates have moved up much more quickly than they did that last cycle. So we're really not seeing anything that is shaking our view that this is proceeding exactly how we would anticipate. So it comes back to our view on when the we've seen over time that these client cash allocation decisions at level of transactional cash reaches a certain floor, and as it starts to approach that floor, it starts to taper up -- the allocation start to taper off and then it's offset by cash that comes in through new accounts. And so we view -- our view is that, that's going to trough at some point in 2023. And then as new cash comes in, we'll be able to reduce the use of the FHLB and any retail CD offers that we have or any other forms of funding that we access. Yes. Thanks for the question. So I think I said last time in the business update that our AOCI was not at all a factor in our capital planning decisions and that remains the case. We're -- I would say that the idea of negative TCE or something like that is not at all a major source of concern. We actually are now in the process of transferring additional securities from available for sale to held to maturity. And as we do that, it would take an instantaneous several hundred basis point increase in rates for our tangible common equity to go negative, which certainly this seems like a very remote possibility. And given the fact that the duration on that available-for-sale portfolio is under 3.5 that amortizes down relatively quickly. So, over time, it would take even a larger increase in interest rates for TCE to go negative. And while you're right that negative TCE means that prevents us from initiating new borrowings from the FHLB without Fed approval, it doesn't affect existing borrowings. It also doesn't affect any of the other forms of funding that I talked about, the CDs or some of the other forms of funding. So we really don't think that this is a meaningful issue or a meaningful concern. Sorry, and on the buybacks, I think no change in our thinking on the buybacks. We still -- as you point out, if AOCI is not part of our regulatory capital. That is what we manage to. And we continue to -- as we've seen in Q3, continue to pursue the opportunistic return of capital to our stockholders. Yes. So this may be one where we want to take this offline and have a conversation with the IR team around going through those costs, Devin. But the FHLB borrowing was a bit to cover some of what we've seen thus far in October and also a bit to get ahead of it. We always want to be ahead of the game around from a liquidity standpoint. And then in terms of the cost and all that, we can get into that in more detail offline with the IR team. It's an interesting question. So I'd say a couple of things. We -- the way we think about managing the duration on the asset side of the equation is really very much an outcome of what we view as the liability duration. And in different rate environments, of course, that liability duration changes. So in a higher rate environment, liability duration shrinks. And so on the margin, you tend to shrink your asset duration and reverse is obviously true. We do -- we have recently resumed the capability to have derivatives. We're not thinking about that in the context necessarily of hedging sort of downside risk, but we see that as -- sometimes, in some cases, a more efficient way to manage our overall asset duration. I would say that -- so I don't think -- I wouldn't anticipate a dramatic change in our philosophy of than what we have done previously. And there's certainly no assumption in that chart that you saw there that we shared any assumption there that we manage our investing philosophy differently than what in the past. Thank you. Thanks, Bill. So if I tell you everything about expenses, now you won't come to the winter business update in February. So I want to make sure -- I want to know, in all seriousness, we're still working through our expense planning for 2023 and certainly 2024. I would say maybe a couple of things. First, maybe to take a step back, I mean, our #1 priority from an expense standpoint is always to support our clients. And this is a time period where our clients certainly need us. Beyond that, our priorities are really around driving down expense on client assets and through the cycle, not every year, but through the cycle, delivering operating leverage, which is a key part of our financial formula. And then, of course, making appropriate investments in the long-term profitable growth of our business. It's certainly a -- it's a delicate balance to manage all 3, but I think you've seen us do that in the past. When times are -- when we're facing more headwinds and tailwinds, we tend to pull back on that third one, and when we got the wind at our backs, we tend to lean a little bit more into some of those longer-term investments. In terms of the -- as you think about 2024, Walt talked about this, but maybe just to reiterate it on the expense there is really no changes in our thinking around expense -- or expectations around expense synergies. Certainly the magnitude of those synergies, we continue to be very committed to and confident in our ability to deliver on those. We'd expect, by the end of this year, we'll probably have achieved, on a run rate basis, roughly 60%, 65% of those expense synergies. And then with the integration time line that Walt talked about, we would expect to deliver the vast majority of those remaining synergies by the end of 2024. So from a reinvestment rate standpoint, we are focused on cash right now and maintaining cash. There's not much reinvestment going on. On duration, you're absolutely right. Actually, despite the significant increase in rates across the curve in the last quarter, our duration on our investment portfolio actually shrank by a 10th, so we went from roughly [4.1] to a little under [4]. And that reflects the types of securities that we have purchased that we really very much target securities that don't have that degree of extension risks. So we feel really good about that. If you look at actually, there's a chart in the appendix, I encourage you to take a look at, that looks at the duration profile of our portfolio over time versus what you see in the some of the benchmarks. So we feel very, very good about the lack of duration extension risk in the portfolio. Sure. So I mean the important point is we definitely view this as very much a temporary funding source as it has been in the past. We've used FHLB previously as a temporary funding source, and we absolutely view it the same way today. I mentioned earlier that we would expect it to be no higher than a mid-single-digit percent of our overall interest-earning assets, and that -- to be clear, that is the combination of FHLB as well as these other funding sources like CD issuance and so forth. And given our expectations that the client cash balances on the balance sheet trough at some point in 2023, that would be the period where we'd be at the peak level. And then as we get to the cash balances grow that, that replaces the higher cost, but -- temporary higher cost, but temporary FHLB, CDs, et cetera, which, again, is helpful from a -- clearly, from a NIM standpoint as we start to pay those balances off and replace them with the client cash balances."

            "content": "[Technical Difficulty] ...that began in 2020 and many others. And in each of these time periods, there was a list of doubters. In fact, I recently went back and read some of the reports and articles that were written about Schwab during those periods. And although I generally respect those who doubted us, I have enormous confidence in our firm and in our people. I have enormous confidence in our ability to serve our 30-million-plus clients, and enormous confidence in our ability to deliver for our long-term stockholders. As we all know, the third quarter was very difficult for investors. The Federal Reserve continued with an aggressive policy designed to battle deep-seated inflation -- they did so with steep increases in rates, and at the same time, equity markets fell for the third consecutive quarter. The S&P 500 and NASDAQ now showing year-to-date losses between 25% and 32%. And yet despite these challenging days for investing, our all-weather business model continued to prove successful. Whether we're looking at our strong organic asset growth rate of 7% reflected in $115 billion of net new assets, or the fact that our retail net new assets in the third quarter were 20% higher than the same period last year. It's clear that our Through clients' eyes strategy is working and a major contributor to our organic growth. And just as our client strategy was successful, our commitment to encouraging a long-term approach to investing was also reflected in our clients' actions. Even with investing sentiment near record lows, our clients remained resilient with net equity buys exceeding net sales. And our clients remained trusting in our advisory services with flows into these solutions in excess of $8 billion during the quarter. Now as expected in a difficult investing environment, cash is an important part of our clients' investing approach. Now this is something that we've always known, always believed in. And as I often say, there's no investor who has ever lived through a bear market who then doubts that cash is a critical part of an asset allocation strategy. Now recently, we know there's been a lot of commentary about so-called client cash sorting. And there's been a lot of commentary as if it's some kind of bad thing or something that we didn't expect or, frankly, didn't welcome. And, to the contrary, we view it as both expected and as a positive. In fact, we put a lot of effort into helping our clients make the most of their cash. Our approach to assisting clients with our cash needs is robust and it's very focused on their needs. For example, for transactional cash, we offer competitive yields and features relative to other transaction accounts, including taking steps like pioneering fee-free ATM withdrawals worldwide. And for investment cash, we offer money market funds with low fees, CDs from banks across the country in a variety of quality fixed income investment options. Our clients' decisions with their cash are, of course, influenced by the interest rate environment. During a ZIRP or 0 interest rate environment, clients have little yield motivation to move money from a transactional category, like a bank sweep or checking, to an investment category, like a purchase money fund or a fixed income offering. And then, of course, when rates rise, it's a prudent decision for clients to make that move with their investment cash, and we encourage that. We encourage those moves. We make outbound phone calls from our financial consultants and others. We do seminars. We offer marketing that encourages clients to position their investment cash into higher-yielding alternatives. Now some might question, well, why would [we] do that? We know that we take a revenue hit with every dollar that moves, for example, from a bank sweep to a money market fund. But to those individuals who question it, I would suggest that maybe they don't really understand what we mean when we say through clients' eyes or they don't really understand our long-term horizon for growth because we proactively contact clients because it's the right thing to do. The right thing to move their investment cash into higher-yielding options. And our clients, not surprisingly, respond very favorably to our proactive efforts to show them how to increase their yields on investment cash. I guess if I were to summarize this slide, I'd say that if you understand our firm, if you understand Schwab, you know we are doing exactly what you should expect us to do in the middle of a rapidly rising rate environment. And our clients are doing exactly what we expect that they would and, frankly, should do. And none of what is happening should interfere with our ability to grow our revenue and our net interest margin, and none of it should impact our ability to deliver earnings growth consistent with our financial formula over the coming quarters and years. Before I pass it over to Rick to cover some of our strategic efforts in more detail, I want to spend a couple of moments on the status of our Ameritrade integration and conversion because we're closing our second full year of preparing for conversion, and we feel very good about where we are. We have built tremendous scale and capacity, far greater than we anticipated when we announced this acquisition. We've committed to retaining our high-end clients with capabilities that take great features from both firms, for example, from Ameritrade, things like iRebal, thinkorswim and thinkpipes. We've worked diligently to make the actual conversion process streamlined and simple for our combined clients, along with retaining key high-quality employees, and of course, we've done all this, as you know, in the middle of a global pandemic. When we complete this integration, we think we will be offering the industry's top overall investing experience. Of course, nothing as large and complex as this integration and conversion goes perfectly. In addition to the pandemic-related issues, which we're all familiar with, 2 additional issues are likely to push our total integration spend about 10% higher than we anticipated 18 months ago. Now the first one is probably obvious to everyone, it's inflation. Technology equipment, cloud contracts, market-driven staff compensation, all these costs more, frankly, they cost a lot more than we anticipated back in 2019 and 2020. In addition, in light of the war in the Ukraine, we made a decision, we believe a correct decision, and this is actually creating the largest reason for these higher costs and also likely to push the last conversion of somewhere around 1% or 2% of our clients back into the first part of 2024. But I want to emphasize, it will not impact the amount or timing of the expense synergies we've committed to, and here's why. The thinkorswim system at Ameritrade relied very heavily on software developers and engineers based in Russia. Now these individuals managed the majority of the TOS system, from design to enhancement and even to ongoing daily maintenance. When the war in Ukraine began, we stopped using those Russian-based resources. This meant not only moving all of those efforts, but also training dozens and dozens of new engineers and developers on the TOS system, and this was very costly, but it was the right thing to do. And I know that anyone listening to this call would have made the exact same decision that we made. So just to sum all this up, despite the pandemic, despite record client engagement, despite the highest inflation in 40 years, despite geopolitical and market volatility, we remain on track to convert 98% to 99% of our clients in 2023, deliver on the expense synergies we committed to at the very outset, and do so with a total integration budget only modestly above our early 2021 estimates. So Rick, let me go ahead and turn it over to you to talk in more detail about some of our strategic efforts. Ken, thanks for the question. So in terms of win-win monetization opportunities, we believe we have a lot of upside. I mean both wealth management and lending, 2 examples of programs that we're focused on today. We think there's enormous upside there. And I shared some of the levers we're trying to pull on wealth. And in lending, of course, we think we'll see more of the upside when we get back into a more normalized interest rate environment. But essentially, what we've done is we've set the table. We've created the digital experiences, the product capabilities, and we've educated our field to be ready to engage clients in those discussions. And so when the interest rate environment becomes more favorable, we expect there to be benefits there. When we think about personalized indexing, which is another one of the programs we've talked about for a while, we expect that to be a 10-year ride of money moving from active strategies and some taxable assets that are in taxable ETFs to move in there. So we think there's a long runway to all 3 of these programs that we think will provide meaningful upside in the coming years. As it relates to the INTF platform, it is very new. We are seeing assets flow there. And our expectation there, of course, is also strong. I think part of what we're seeing, or part of the challenge broadly, whether it's INTF or our relationship with T. Rowe Price is it's just it's been a difficult time for active management. And so that's one that we believe over the long run, again, we'll pay dividends, but it will, in part, depend on it being an environment where active management is in favor. Sure. Thanks, Ben, for the question. We -- I was actually just looking at a report on pipeline for new RIAs moving independent, and those numbers remain very robust. They are on par with what we have seen over recent quarters. Actually, if I were to think about a slowdown in RIAs moving into the independent model, I wouldn't think of it correlated to integration. I would think of it more correlated to the market environment. And that's what I was interested in when I actually asked this exact question myself a week or so ago to see whether the equity market declined had made it less apt for RIAs to consider moving to independents. And the fact that the pipeline was comparable to what it's been over recent quarters actually was very encouraging to me. So I guess, in summary, I would say I would not expect the integration to have an impact on breakaways, but I do think you have to watch the equity markets because, over time, it can be more difficult for someone to break away when they're asking their clients to follow them after a period in which the equity markets have suffered as much as they have of late. Thanks again, Jeff. And I want to thank everyone for joining us today. Today is actually a special day, an important milestone. As many of you know, our own Rich Fowler, he of the top-down days, this is his last quarter as Head of Investor Relations. My understanding is he's going to sprint off into retirement. Those of you who know Rich, know that he was a college level sprinter, which is no surprise to any of us who know Rich, but he's going to sprint off into retirement. Rich is the only CIRO that we have ever had at Schwab. That's pretty remarkable. He's been here through 3 CFOs, over 100 quarterly earnings cycles. But when I think of Rich, the things that stand out are his integrity, clarity, transparency, whether it's disclosures, interactions with all of you, incredibly special. And as great of a CIRO as he is, he is an even better person. We're going to miss you, Rich. You've done a wonderful job of preparing Jeff and team to step into your shoes. And I just -- and speaking directly to Rich, want him to rest assured that the priorities and values that he's embodied at Schwab will continue long after he has crossed the next finish line in his sprint. So thanks again, Rich, and thanks to all of you for joining us, and we look forward to speaking with you again in a future business update. Bye-bye."

            "name": "Rick Wurster",
            "content": "Thank you, Walt. Walt shared the success we're having with clients, and it starts with seeing through clients' eyes and making a difference in clients' financial lives. We continue to be guided by our through clients' eyes approach and have additional opportunities to expand how we help clients. We are currently focused on 3 strategic focus areas: scale and efficiency, win-win monetization and client segmentation. Within scale and efficiency, Walt just shared an update on our firm's #1 priority, integration. As part of the integration, we've accelerated investments in technology and the client experience to make it even easier for clients to do business with us. Seeing through clients' eyes by making it easier to invest and build wealth has been a hallmark of both Schwab and Ameritrade. Our ongoing efforts to enhance experiences for our clients and our field will continue to be a key differentiator. I'll spend our time today going into more detail on 3 opportunities: wealth management, lending and our RIA client segment. We said it before, and it remains true today, we are bullish on advice. Although investor sentiment has fallen in this current market environment, our clients are still highly engaged in our wealth and advice solutions and flows continue to be strong. I've spoken in prior quarters about how Schwab is uniquely positioned to deliver a continuum of wealth management experiences to meet a range of client needs. On one end of the continuum, we offer clients access to investment solutions they can use for part of their portfolios. The acquisitions -- acquisition of Wasmer Schroeder Strategies is a clear example of a win-win opportunity for both clients and our firm. We brought down the cost of access to fixed income managed accounts on our platform and flows have moved to Schwab. The strategies have attracted over $5 billion in net flows over the last 2 years. This includes $1 billion in net flows in the third quarter alone, the highest quarterly net flows we've seen since launching these strategies on the retail platform in January of \u201821. Another investment solution I'll highlight briefly is Schwab Personalized Indexing. We are still in the early days, and our efforts are focused on educating clients in the field about the potential benefits direct indexing can provide. We expect it will grow more rapidly as clients continue to learn about it. Moving along the continuum, we're also meeting client needs with our 2 full-service wealth offerings, Schwab Wealth Advisory and Schwab Advisor Network, or SAN. Despite a challenging market environment, clients are highly engaged. Both Schwab Wealth Advisory and SAN attracted strong quarterly net flows in the third quarter at $2.6 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively. This is an opportunity for win-win monetization as it is an area where we are investing in the client experience and have several levers to improve our economics. First, we believe there's an opportunity to attract more clients to the programs, particularly at Ameritrade, where less than 7% of assets are engaged in advice, and we have already seen 40% of Ameritrade FCs enroll a client in Schwab Wealth Advisory and over 80% of Ameritrade FCs have enrolled a client in some form of Schwab Advice. Second, we believe we can increase flows into Schwab Wealth Advisory through continuing to enhance the program for clients and making it easier for our field to use. Third, we are reviewing our SAN program economics to make sure we are capturing our fair share given the value Schwab brings to the program, including our track record of successful new client acquisition, our sustained marketing investment, our brand and the important role our field plays in the process and with clients. Schwab Wealth Advisory consistently has the highest Client Promoter Scores at the firm, and we are investing in the program to make sure it remains that way and increases its growth. As I've shared previously, we are adding to our capacity to sustain growth, training advisers in new ways to add to the wealth expertise we're bringing to clients and making investments in the sales team that supports this offer. We're enhancing the client experience, including making it easier to access our supporting expert teams and beginning to add to our digital experiences. And we are expanding our capabilities, and, over time, plan to provide a discretionary wealth management experience. We believe that demand for advice will continue to increase, and we expect to see growth in both Schwab Wealth Advisory and SAN. With through clients' eyes as our North Star, we want to make sure that no matter what type of advice and investor needs that we can connect them with the right model. When we think about long-term growth, we believe lending is a win-win opportunity as well. We know that retail clients want to consolidate as much of their financial lives as possible in one place. We know that RIAs want to reduce the number of relationships their clients need to have with financial institutions. Clients who do their borrowing at Schwab today are delighted by our competitive rates, and our Client Promoter Scores exemplify that. And with a large balance sheet, this is a productive use of capital for us. With our lending offer, we are making investments today, so we can be the preferred lending provider for clients on our platform. We introduced a preferred rate program, and we are enhancing the digital experience. We are building out our service teams to provide more tailored service, akin to what you might see at the largest banks or wealth firms. In the third quarter, we expanded the rollout of the ultra-high net worth senior lending team model to 6 more retail regions in preparation for full retail rollout by the end of the year. In the last quarter, we started to train and license more than 600 Ameritrade FCs so they can offer PAL and mortgage loans to their clients. We've also seen increased retail FC adoption of lending despite rising rates. And we've partnered with adviser services to help onboard some significant new RIAs with billions in assets through our lending capabilities. These efforts have been met with very positive feedback. Even in a difficult lending environment, we are seeing growth. PAL demand continues to grow, it is up 31% compared to last year because demand is driven by factors outside of the rate cycle. As we continue to build out the offer for the future, we will take the no trade-offs approach to lending that clients expect from Schwab, attractive rates, enhanced digital experiences and a tailored service model. As we've shared previously, about 2% of retail clients turned to Schwab for their borrowing needs. We see about the same level of utilization among RIA clients as well. We believe there is an attractive amount of potential upside here. Now let's turn to client segmentation. We are continuing to enhance and expand the services and solutions that we offer to our RIA client segment. Expanding our institutional no transaction fee or INTF mutual fund offering for RIAs who [custody] at Schwab and Ameritrade, makes us even more attractive. Earlier this month, we added more than 800 institutional funds without a transaction fee from 15 leading third-party asset managers. This is in addition to over 130 funds already available through our strategic relationship with T. Rowe Price. We're thrilled to offer this expanded lineup to advisers. With more choices for low-cost share classes without a transaction fee, RIAs can personalize their clients' investment portfolios and put more of their clients' initial investments to work. It is a win for RIAs and their clients, and it is a win for us at Schwab. As I look at opportunities on the horizon, our through clients' eyes approach continues to be both our North Star and our winning strategy. Clients are continuing to turn to Schwab, and they remain engaged despite economic uncertainty. This challenging environment reinforces the importance of our strategy and delivering on our strategic priorities. I'm energized by the momentum we've built. By continuing to keep clients at the forefront of everything we do, I'm confident that Schwab remains well positioned to capitalize on the key opportunities ahead of us. And with that, I'll turn it over to Peter."

        "content": "Jeff Edwards: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Schwab's 2022 Summer Business Update. This is Jeff Edwards, Managing Director of Investor Relations. I can only imagine how unsettling it might be for some of our more tenured update attendees to not hear the soothing rhythm of Mr. Fowler's voice kicking off the webcast this morning. But fear not, he is here comfortably perched right next to me in his best Ariat boots as we broadcast live from our headquarters in Westlake, Texas. We once again have our esteemed [tripart] of our presenters for our 60-minute session today, which will include prepared remarks followed by Q&A. Walt Bettinger, along with Rick Wurster will provide a strategic update including insights into the current investor mindset as they navigate what has proven to be a challenging time in the market. Peter Crawford will then review our recent record financial performance as well as discuss our current financial outlook before taking us to Q&A, which I will help moderate. [Operator Instructions] A friendly reminder that today's materials will be posted to the IR website at the beginning of Peter's remarks. Last, but certainly not least, please do not forget to review our lovely wall of words, which reminds us all that outcomes can differ from expectations. So please stay up today with our disclosures. With all that behind us, it's time to dive in. Walt, over to you.\nWalt Bettinger: Thanks a lot, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for investing some time to listen-in on our July business update. So 3 months ago, I emphasized the word consistency during our time together. And I stressed the way consistency plays a critical role at Schwab. A consistent business strategy, a consistent commitment to feeding the virtuous cycle and innovating on behalf of investors, a consistent financial reporting cadence, a consistent commitment to our employees and the communities that we live and work in. And in a consistent long-term approach that is focused not just on the current year, but on years to come. And today, as we discuss our second quarter results and our viewpoint for the future, the benefits of our consistent strategy and commitment to clients, I think, is highly evident. Because it's times like these when investor's sentiment is negative when the equity markets are falling, these are the times that separate companies who chase headlines and/or focus on short-term success from a company like Schwab, a company built to last, a company built to succeed in all environments. By serving investors and advisers in good times and difficult times, while also delivering the superior financial results that you see. Now before we discuss the second quarter in a bit more specifics, I want to touch on the announcement this morning from our Board of Directors that I would be joining our founder, Chuck Schwab, as Co-Chair of our Board. Although it's personally a tremendous honor that Chuck and the Board have seen fit to entrust me with this additional responsibility, the reality is this announcement is not about me. Announcement is aligned with the consistency theme that I just spoke of. Consistency and continuity are hallmarks of Schwab. They add to a sense of confidence that our clients, our employees, stockholders and the communities where we live and work can rely on. Our consistent strategy that we refer to as to clients' eyes is not a catchy slogan. It's a timeless strategy. It's timeless because, in our view, it is the only business strategy that can stand the test of time. A strategy that places our clients at the forefront of the decisions we make. And a key part of my new responsibilities as Co-Chair of the Board will be to ensure that our focus on clients, our consistent focus on clients remains the hallmark of Schwab for years to come. As all of you know well, in the second quarter, the equity markets officially entered bear market territory. Volatility remained quite high and the Federal Reserve advanced their efforts to bring inflation under control by raising interest rates. And of course, this continued with another 75 basis point increase yesterday, moving the target rate to between 2.25% and 2.5%. Now not surprisingly, investors felt this pain. They felt the pain from the equity market declines with investor sentiment falling sharply and reaching levels that we haven't seen in many, many years. Interestingly, however, Schwab clients continued to invest for the long haul. I guess you could say consistency is a hallmark of our clients also. The net buy/sell ratio of our clients during the quarter as punishing as the second quarter was, was only modestly lower than it was during the meme stock quarter back in Q1 of last year. I guess the takeaway is that our clients are investors. And with well over 30 million investor accounts, yes, there are different approaches for certain. Some are buy and hold, some trade actively, some rely on an independent adviser. Of course, many are a combination of all these. But what's important is that collectively, they take a long-term view of the markets. Collectively, they understand the power of being in the market. Collectively, they know that consistency, again, is the path to success when it comes to long-term investing. This long-term focus by our clients is not an accident. It's an outcome of our purpose and our strategy at Schwab because we focus on attracting long-term investors and cultivating them on educating them on the power of long-term diversified investing and being in the market and staying in the market and being consistent with their investing strategies. And of course, there it is, again, that word, consistency. We believe that a major part of why our clients can feel confident with taking a long-term approach to their investing is the confidence that they have in us at Schwab. Despite, again, what anyone would describe as a relatively brutal equity and bond market of late. Our clients still give us Net Promoter Scores in the mid- to high 60s. And with our fastest-growing client base, high net worth investors offering us our highest scores overall. Our client easy score is now more than 90, reflecting our commitment to making it easy for our clients to do business with us. And meanwhile, 83% of our clients rate their phone-based service experience with us as perfect, a score of 7 out of 7. In addition to our efforts, of course, around ease of business and quality of service being recognized by our clients, we're gratified that many third parties do as well. The importance of service quality, timely and responsive service, it's especially critical during difficult times for investors because it's service quality that helps keep these investors informed, aware and as confident as possible. It contributes to client engagement and optimism for the future. I just encourage you not to make the mistake and think that given where the markets are that our clients are not highly engaged, optimistic and investing for the long term. And I think as evidence reflecting this optimism, our clients continue to add money to their investing strategies at a relatively high rate despite the bear market with annualized organic growth about 5% and really rather astonishing for a bear market, 6% when we exclude April. And of course, it's record-breaking levels of tax payments. So this is a picture of a strong, healthy company excelling during a quarter as difficult as any quarter in many years. But I think what's also incredibly important is it's a picture of a healthy client base. A client base taking a long-term approach to investing a consistent long-term philosophy. Now with over $180 billion in core net new assets in the first half of this year and our seventh consecutive quarter with over 1 million new brokerage accounts, our organic growth is indisputable. We still maintain a net TOA ratio of approximately 1.6:1. That means we're winning $1.60 from competitors for every dollar they win from us. Again, reflecting our competitive strength from a relative market is also there. Importantly, our efforts to ensure long-term organic growth continues as we diversify our client base. You can see that over half of our new to retail clients are under the age of 40 and they drove over half of our new client net new assets. So this is particularly important because it illustrates that not only are we winning in the under 40 segment. But we are winning under 40 investors with substantial investable assets, not simply winning younger investors who have little money with which to invest. And as we've repeatedly emphasized, our business-serving independent investment advisers continues its success serving the needs of all sizes of advisers. So we aim to provide the best platform for every RIA regardless of size or business model or specialty. And our success in winning clients of all shapes and sizes clearly indicates we're succeeding. Now while we continue to be the leader in serving the largest advisers, again, what's fascinating about this chart, is that our largest share of net new assets year-to-date have actually come from smaller advisers, those who manage less than $500 million. As we've repeatedly stated, and I don't know how many more times we can continue, but we will keep saying it, our RIA custody business is committed to serving advisers of all sizes, in a world-class manner and without charging custodial fees. So Rick, let me turn it over to you, and you can cover some more details of some of our efforts.\nRick Wurster: Thanks, Walt, and hello, everyone. I'll spend the next few minutes talking more about why clients continue to turn to us in good times and in challenging times, and I'll share an update on several of our strategic initiatives. At the heart of our success is our Through Clients' Eyes strategy, which has been our consistent strategy for years. When we see Through Clients' Eyes, our priorities are clear. And what we continue to hear from clients is they want the combination of low-cost and high-quality experiences and solutions that deliver great value. The transparency that is the foundation of any trusted relationship, multichannel experiences that meet them where they are and ease. Clients expect their interactions with us to be easy. And they also want to consolidate as much of their financial lives as possible in the one place. The reason clients continue to turn to Schwab is our consistent no trade-offs approach that you've heard Walt talk about. At Schwab, clients don't have to choose between low-cost and stellar service. Access to some of the best service professionals in the industry and the digital and technology platforms and experiences they expect from a modern firm, straightforward foundational investment offers and more personalized solutions. Tools and capabilities for those who want to take investing into their own hands and a spectrum of advised offers that help clients get to where they want to go with the help of a professional. Proprietary and third-party products that give them the choice they want. They don't need to make any trade-offs because Schwab is uniquely positioned to deliver it all here with our strength as a wealth manager, as a bank and as an asset manager. Our size and our focus uniquely enable us to deliver for clients in a way that sets us apart in the industry. And this focus, which starts with seeing Through Clients' Eyes drives the virtuous cycle. This means we will continue to put clients at the forefront and challenge the status quo to benefit investors. And when we do that, investors will reward us by trusting us with more of their assets. This leads to consistent financial results and outstanding stockholder value, which enables us to continue to invest in our business to serve our clients' needs, and that brings us back to the start of the virtuous cycle. You see on this page what no trade-offs looks like for our clients. It is a competitive blended advice race, advise rate and the ability to talk to us quickly when you call for support. It is making investments to hire more client-facing employees who are there when a client walks in the door and investments in technology to make their experiences with us as easy as possible. It is a continuum of offerings ranging from straightforward to personalized that meets the needs of investors who are just starting out and the needs of our high net worth clients who are seeking advice. It is industry-recognized tools and resources for self-directed investors and advised offerings that continue to attract investors with more complex financial needs. And it is the product choice that our clients want. Our consistent strategy is supporting our clients through a challenging environment. At the same time, we remain focused on strengthening our offer to meet client needs into the future through our strategic focus areas. First, we're achieving even more scale and efficiency. Integration remains our #1 priority. The integration is bringing capabilities that make our combined offering experiences stronger than either firm was on its own. Our Schwab clients will benefit from thinkorswim, iRebal and thinkpipes, while our Ameritrade clients will benefit from the advice capabilities, banking solutions and digital experiences at Schwab. Together, our no trade-offs approach is even stronger. As we look to client day 1 beginning in 2023, we have already multiplied the scalability in our systems and increased our capacity to support client needs and growth well into the future. For example, we've increased systems capacity to support the volumes of the combined company with plenty of capacity for spikes in transaction volumes. The modernization work on our platforms has made them both more resilient as well as much easier to scale as the client base continues to expand. Our systems now support 4 to 6x the previous volume of transactions with faster processing times across the board, including for trades and client communications. We also remain focused on eased, making it easier for clients to do business with us and enhancing our operating model to support future growth. We're essentially accelerating several years of digital transformation into the integration window, enabling us to support a smooth client transition, deliver on our expense synergy commitments and limit expense growth after client conversion. Turning now to win-win monetization opportunities. We remain focused on 3 key areas: wealth management, asset management and lending. And I'll speak more about wealth and asset management in a moment, and I'll start with lending. The bank continues to be a differentiator for Schwab. We won the J.D. Power Award for being ranked highest in customer satisfaction with direct retail banking 4 years in a row. When we look at our lending business, even in the current interest rate environment, our TOA portfolio balance or pledged asset line portfolio balance was $14.8 billion, 42% above the prior year. And as we look ahead, we're excited to roll out a number of enhancements that will make it even easier to go through the loan process at Schwab. Finally, we're doing more to meet the segmented needs of our clients, including our high net worth clients, RIAs and other key client segments. As Walt mentioned in his opening comments, a key aspect of being an enduring company is serving a broad range of clients and continuing to meet their needs as their circumstances and behavior change. We compete, however, against a number of firms that focus on specific client segments to successfully compete against these firms, we will stay focused on our clients and leverage our scale to meet the needs of the various client segments that we serve. I'll wrap up today with a deeper look into how we're delivering a continuum of wealth management experiences, and I'll share more about our Trader segment in particular. Looking at the continuum of our wealth management offer, we have attractive full-service wealth programs and investing solutions that clients are turning to in the current market environment. When you look at our full-service wealth programs, we recently rebranded our premier wealth management offer Schwab Private Client, to be named Schwab Wealth Advisory to better reflect what the offer does for clients. We are investing in the offer, including enhancing our digital experience, providing resources and support to advisers to ensure even greater advice and service and bringing more of our wealth expertise at Schwab to the client. We also have investing solutions that clients often use as a part of their portfolio. With the increase in interest rates, we've seen record flows into Wasmer Schroeder on the Schwab platform. We've also launched new personalized investing solutions to complement the core offering. Schwab personalized indexing launched and is delivered for clients in a volatile market and has delivered on the promised tax savings. We continue to make progress on expanding our thematic investing offer. And in the second quarter, we further expanded our ESG tools with the introduction of MSCI's ESG ratings for individual stocks. There is tremendous opportunity ahead to enhance the wealth management experience. Over time, we'll look at providing a discretionary wealth management experience for clients and have plans to add digital capabilities to meet clients where they are. Now I'd like to turn to the work we are doing to support traders, one of our key segments. One of the benefits of integration is we will be able to offer Schwab and Ameritrade clients a leading end-to-end trading experience with thinkorswim, one of the strongest active trader platforms in the industry. In August 2020, we announced plans to adopt thinkorswim and integrate its award-winning trading platforms, education and tools into our trader offerings for clients. This will provide our trader clients with 3 interconnected channels of engagement across desktop, web and mobile, all integrated with one another. It's enhanced trading experiences and comprehensive set of trading tools across the product space, supporting equities, options, ETFs, futures and foreign exchange trading and a tightly integrated trade and portfolio analysis capability. In fact, we recently rolled out new enhancements that reinforce our commitment to the thinkorswim platform, including providing clients with greater opportunities for customization. And in April, we launched a virtual active trader branch. Here, active trader financial consultants focus on trader coaching and wealth management to help meet the unique needs of qualifying self-directed traders. Finally, I'd point out that one of our biggest focus area for our trader clients is trading platform stability. Nothing is more important to our business than safeguarding our systems and ensuring our clients have reliable access to their accounts. I'll wrap up where Walt started, with our Through Clients' Eyes approach as our consistent strategy, we continue to be there for our clients even as the market has become more challenging for them. This approach sets us apart in the industry and puts us in a strong competitive position, allowing us to continue to invest in the strategic initiatives that will meet client needs into the future, while enabling the outstanding financial performance that Peter is about to discuss. So Peter, over to you.\nPeter Crawford: Well, thank you very much, Rick. So Walt and Rick talked about our ability to build and maintain the loyalty of our clients despite the challenging environment and very low investor sentiment. How that loyalty has translated into continued robust organic growth? The strong positioning we have built around modern wealth management and our progress and plans for making that position even more formidable. In my time today, I'll talk about how the combination of strong business momentum, a more subdued, but still quite active client base and rising interest rates produced record financial performance in the second quarter. I'll also provide an updated outlook for the rest of the year, which demonstrates the power of our all-weather business model and the benefits we derive from higher rates. And finally, I'll provide an update on our capital planning with our capital ratios having reached their highest level since the pandemic began, enabling us to potentially accelerate our capital return activities. What you'll hopefully hear is that this company continues to drive exceptional operating and financial performance, that we're clearly benefiting from higher rates and are poised to benefit even more in the quarters ahead. But that's only part of the story. In short, we're demonstrating once again the enduring power of Schwab's strategy and business model, one that combines growth, profitability and capital return with a lot more opportunity ahead of us. Let's talk about some of the factors that contributed to our strong financial performance in the second quarter. Our performance was obviously helped by higher interest rates across the curve, which boosted our net interest margin and BDA yield and eliminated money fund fee waivers by the end of the quarter. While falling equity markets weighed on asset management fees, and the ensuing decline in investor sentiment that Walt talked about resulted in trading activity and margin utilization that were lower than the first quarter but still at historically high levels. What endures amidst this choppy environment is our unmatched ability to drive robust organic growth. Roughly $185 billion in core net new assets in the first half of the year despite record high tax payments by clients, and 5% growth in active accounts on the heels of the unprecedented new account formation we saw in the first half of 2021. Despite some cross currents, our financial performance in the second quarter broke multiple records. Revenue increased 13% year-over-year and 9% sequentially, driven by a 31% increase in net interest revenue reflecting a 16 basis point year-over-year increase on our net interest margin, are up 24 basis points from the first quarter and interest-earning assets that largely were in line with expectations. Flat asset management and administrative fees, as the elimination of money fund fee waivers and organic inflows offset the impact of the market decline. And trading revenue that was lower than last year despite a slight increase in daily average trades. We limited adjusted expense growth of 2% year-over-year, all of which helped produce an adjusted pretax margin of 49.5%, a record $2 billion in adjusted net income and a record $0.97 in adjusted EPS. That was the income statement. Let's turn our attention briefly to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet assets declined 4% year-to-date due mostly to those record tax payments in April as well as some sorting activity in the second quarter that was consistent with our expectations given the rate environment. Our strong earnings, combined with that slight decrease in assets, boosted our capital ratios to the highest level we've seen in roughly 2.5 years. Despite the challenging equity markets, we feel very confident about our ability to drive strong revenue growth and resume a higher pace of capital return. Assuming the Fed follows through as the market predicts with a Fed funds rate exiting 2022 at 3.5%, we'd expect to produce an 11% to 13% year-over-year increase in revenue despite the market downturn. That reflects continued expansion of our net interest margin to just over 2% by Q4. Deposit betas that we expect to continue to run a bit lower than the last rising rate cycle and a continuation of clients moving some of their investment cash off our balance sheet in search of higher yields. But remember, when they do that, it frees up capital that we can return to our stockholders. We continue to thoughtfully and responsibly manage our expenses, navigating this inflationary environment, driving efficiency throughout our business and prioritizing our investments to advance the strategic agenda that Rick discussed. Controlling for an increase in the pass-through fee that boosts both revenue and expense and which we do not control, our full year expense outlook remains the same as what we shared back in February. And with our inaugural CCAR submission now behind us, which demonstrated the strength of our balance sheet as reflected the fact that we're the only firm to see an increase in capital ratios during the stress event. And our capital levels in the mid-6s, we are nearing the point at which we can accelerate capital return. You saw that the Board approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.22 as well as a new $15 billion buyback authorization that we'd expect to utilize as soon as later this year and beyond. And at the same time, we also have the option of redeeming one or more of our outstanding preferreds. I want to close by picking up on a theme that Walt discussed in his opening comments, how this is as a company built and managed for the long term. So we're certainly pleased by our current financial performance despite the difficult macro environment. We are much more gratified by our ability to consistently drive a set of behaviors and outcomes that have enabled us to deliver for clients and stockholders for over 4 decades. Continuing to be the premier asset gatherer as indicated by our net new assets, new accounts and TOA ratio, a reflection of our Through Clients' Eyes strategy and formidable competitive position. Building a diversified and resilient business model that converts business growth into revenue growth, producing record revenue in the second quarter maintaining discipline in how we manage expenses, producing operating leverage through the cycle and increasing margins, which have now reached nearly 50% and have an opportunity to continue to climb and being very efficient in how we deploy the capital that has been entrusted to us or as we're now poised to do return excess capital back to our stockholders. Make no mistake, Challenging conditions in all this is a good environment for both our actual financial results and our future financial prospects, and we intend to pursue those prospects as we remain focused on serving clients and being good stewards of our stockholders' capital. With that, Jeff, let me turn it over to you to facilitate our Q&A.\nJeff Edwards: Operator, let's open up the phone lines and turn to the first person in the queue.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Ken Worthington with JPMC.\nKen Worthington: I guess first, what was the level of cash sorting that you saw in the second quarter? And what is your outlook for the size of the balance sheet or interest-earning assets, however you want to answer it. For 2022, given what you're learning about cash sorting and your internal outlook or whatever for net new assets? And then any thought on the mix of your balance sheet in terms of cash and the investment portfolio as we continue to walk through this cash sorting process through the rest of the year and beyond.\nPeter Crawford: Thanks, Ken, for the question. So I would say, in aggregate, the dynamics around cash sorting in the second quarter were very consistent with our overall expectations. And I think this is -- I know there's going to be a lot of questions about sorting. So an attempt maybe to anticipate or perhaps preempt them. It might be helpful just to share a few high-level thoughts around sorting. I want to reiterate that our expectation is that the level of sorting won't be higher than the last rising rate cycle, and it actually could be somewhat lower given the fact that we're not going through the bulk transfer process that we're doing in the last rising rate cycle, that we have an influx of smaller accounts who tend to do less sorting. And we also have a client base that is much more actively trading than they were previously, and we know that when clients are trading, they tend to keep more transactional cash. Second, we know from history that eventually cash, both total cash and on balance sheet cash will find its level, after which point it will grow with the growth in accounts and the growth of total client assets. Third, and this is really important, the cash is staying at Schwab. We've done a lot to create a great array of cash solutions and we've done a lot and continue to do a lot to make our clients aware of those solutions, make sure they're making smart decisions with regard -- regarding their cash. We want our clients to be happy, and we want that cash to stay at Schwab, and that we're seeing -- certainly seeing that happen. Fourth, I think when you look at sorting in isolation, you're only really looking at one part of the equation. And what I mean by that is that the rate increases that give rise to the sorting also help us earn more on the interest assets that remain here, the cash that remains here. Driving NIR higher despite lower interest-earning assets. So in the scenario that we shared, if you do the math, as an example, you'll see that we'd expect to generate roughly $500 million more in net interest revenue in the fourth quarter than we did in the second quarter despite allowing for some continuation of the client cash sorting. And the last point I would make, fifth point I would make is to the extent that cash balances decrease, it frees up capital, enabling us to buy back stock and drive EPS growth one way or the other. Hopefully, that answers your question, Ken.\nKen Worthington: Awesome. And then just on the win-win monetization as a key priority. You've announced the enhanced relationship with T. Rowe. I guess how is that proceeding? And then can you talk about plans to further build on what you started with T. Rowe with other asset managers? What's the road map? And what should we be expecting for the $1.5 trillion or so of third-party fund assets that you're not charging asset managers directly for right now.\nRick Wurster: Thank you for the question. First thing I would say as it relates to your specific question, Ken, on T. Rowe, I would say that it's very early days. We're just getting that program going. We are seeing some enthusiasm for it among our clients. And we are seeing a simpler process that we've built around our clients finding the product that they want to be well received by our clients. So we're making it easier for clients to find the right product for them. In terms of specifics, I would say that we've launched the T. Rowe program into a challenging market, where we're seeing both active management and interest and equities declined to some extent because of the volatility in the market. And so we've seen some headwinds, but with those headwinds, of course, I'd bring it back to our all-weather model when active management is out of favor, passive is in favor, and we've seen strong growth in our ETF business. We're third this year in flows with relatively strong inflows. So again, we think about it as an all-weather model. And importantly, we also think about delivering the choice clients want. So the program is doing exactly what we'd want it to so far. We've got plans in the future to leverage the program to a greater extent. And we're also investing in our experience for advisers through an institutional no transaction fee platform, I think shows again our commitment to delivering for advisers. In terms of your final part of your question, Ken, I think the philosophy of making sure that we create a win-win deal for clients for ourselves and for managers is important and one that we will continue to strike across our third-party platform. So that's certainly a part of our future plans.\nOperator: Next question comes from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler.\nRich Repetto: Walt and Rick and Peter, I guess, first, congrats, Walt, on being named co-Chairman of Schwab. It's a great honor for you, for sure. So my first question would be just a follow-up on the sorting. And Peter, you didn't -- or one of the questions was the balance sheet or the average interest-earning assets exiting the year? And can you sort of more quantitatively sort of compare 2Q sorting to what your expectations were and the expectations, I guess, for the rest of the year as well.\nPeter Crawford: Thanks, Rich. So you'll see in the appendix, we have a lot of detail around the assumptions in the scenario that we shared. And you'll see in the appendix an assumption that the balance sheet contracts by a similar aggregate level as what we saw in the first half of the year. Bearing in mind, of course, that the first half of the year was influenced by the tax payments in April as well as the changes in the mark-to-market value of the available-for-sale securities. And of course, in the second half of the year, you typically have a seasonal tax buildup in December.\nRich Repetto: Okay. I'll look at the appendix closer. I guess a follow-up question would be for Walt. And it's on regulation and I think everybody is aware, Chair Gensler, SEC Chair Gensler made some remarks in early June about things that he was looking at, not formal proposals, but things that he was going to emphasize in regards to retail equity market structure. And I just wanted to get Walt, what sort of Schwab's view on some of the changes that at least he has spoken out in favor, including the minimum price increments, the smaller NBBO protected sizes in this order by order competition?\nWalt Bettinger: Sure. Thank you, Rich. And also thank you for the kind words. I'm excited and as I mentioned, honored to add the additional responsibilities as Co-Chair to my duties as CEO. So of course, we all watched with great interest your interview with Chair Gensler. And we have great respect for the Chair as well, frankly, as his objective of striving to improve the trading experience for investors overall. I think in fairness, we have to wait and see what any actual proposal might be and what it might entail. It's also important for us to bear in mind that I think it's safe to say that retail investors have never had a better overall experience, including the quality and timeliness of their execution. It's difficult to comment on all the various items that Chair Gensler spoke on, but maybe I'll just identify the last one to provide some thoughts for everyone, around the idea from an auction. I mean, certainly, an auction idea is interesting. But I do worry a bit about whether it contemplates auctions in all different types of market environments. We know that in the current structure, execution, timeliness and speed is assured no matter what the environment is. And when I just take a step back, say, from the equity markets and just think of auctions in general, whether you're auctioning a home or art or something near and dear to my heart, baseball cards, since I'm a baseball card collector. Auctions tend to work really well when you have a favorable economic environment and a lot of liquidity in a system. And conversely, auctions tend to struggle during a more difficult economic environments or when there's less liquidity. And you start to get wide gaps and spreads between what maybe the seller in the case of an auction was hoping to receive and price what they actually receive. So again, I'm not suggesting that, that illustration says that an auction couldn't be workable. But I just think these are the kind of things that have to be very carefully thought through. The math needs to be done very thoughtfully and evaluated to see whether we're actually creating a better environment for investors overall. And I am confident that, that appropriate process will be followed if, in fact, these rules are formally proposed.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDan Fannon: I wanted to follow up just on the expense outlook and understand the guidance for this year. Looking at the second half of the year, maybe what the incremental spend outside of the exchange fee rate increase, where those levels might be? And then thinking a little bit forward into next year, can you remind us what's left in terms of synergies and how we can think about maybe that rolling through in 2023 and maybe a more normalized kind of growth rate for expenses longer term?\nPeter Crawford: Sure. So thanks for the question. So in terms of the expense outlook, I shared in this scenario what the expense outlook would be for the full year. So looking at our typical seasonal pattern, you tend to see a little bit lighter expenses in the third quarter and a little bit heavier in the fourth quarter. So as you think about the math on that. I think the important point on expenses is, is we want to continue to drive down our expense on client assets through the cycle. And we want to continue to deliver operating leverage, which is a key part of our financial formula. At the same time, we want to make sure that we're investing in our clients and certainly the long-term growth of our business. That is certainly a delicate balance, but I think you've seen us manage that to achieve that overtime with EOCA declining and our margins increasing. So that continues to be our focus. Sorry, the second question -- part of your question was on -- try again.\nDan Fannon: Just longer term, the expense synergies as we think about '23 coming back.\nPeter Crawford: Sorry, the expense synergies yes. So we have roughly -- perhaps a little bit less than half of the overall expense synergies to deliver. We've said previously that the pace of delivery will be a little bit lighter now relative to the first year or 2 post acquisition. The next big unlock on those expense synergies will be as we complete the client conversions and can eliminate the duplicate systems and so forth that you should see a more meaningful portion of the expenses -- expense synergies materialize at that point in time. We continue to feel very confident in our ability to hit the expense synergy numbers that we have shared previously.\nDan Fannon: And then just as a follow-up, Walt, just thinking about the adviser backdrop and attracting new advisers in a more volatile backdrop. Can you talk about the backlog? And is that harder for maybe those advisers to move their books when clients are maybe not doing as well? Or are you seeing just as robust a pipeline as you have previously?\nWalt Bettinger: Yes. That's -- it's a good question. So right now, I think the pipeline is as robust as we've ever experienced. But I believe your assumption is not an inaccurate one that when you have a more difficult equity market, that it is probably a little bit more difficult for advisers to move to independents, but it's probably a lag factor, which is why we're not seeing it reflected in our current book of business. I think more what you see in real time is that some investors who invest with advisers may be a bit more hesitant to move money under the management of that adviser during a very difficult market environment. So you probably get more near-term implication from that. And maybe a little bit more of a lag implication from a weaker equity market in terms of advisers moving to independents. But as of right now, our pipeline is as strong and robust as we've experienced. And we feel very optimistic about our ability to assist those advisers moving independents and moving their assets to us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken [ph] with UBS.\nUnidentified Analyst: I'm glad she said UBS because I did not catch the name she said. So Peter, wanted to follow up with you on the appendix and the reference cash? And just clarify some of your prior comments about sorting. I think previously on the spring update, you had indicated that a roughly 20% decline in sweep cash would be the expectation based upon the experience last cycle. And when we look at the pie chart that shows the cash breakdown, I would assume that, that 20% would apply to really just the universe that doesn't include, obviously, sweep money fund. BDA has a different profile, as you said, more active-oriented and checking and savings. Is that the base that we should be thinking about when we're applying that 20%?\nPeter Crawford: So thanks for the question. So just to clarify, I think what we said in the spring business update that we didn't expect it to be higher than that level. And as I mentioned today, I think it could conceivably be lower than that. But you are right that when you think about the pool that we're talking about here, it is really that Bank Sweep and perhaps to a lesser extent, the free credit -- broker-dealer free credit balances you see in the pie chart. So it definitely is not on the total pool of cash. You're absolutely right about that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. And when we think about the 2Q experience, it's a little tricky because we had some sorting get started. You had said it was roughly in line with your expectations, which is encouraging. But there was some tax noise in there, too. When we think about the reductions in the quarter, it might have been actually partially offset by some increase in cash due to volatility. Can you maybe help us think through sorting experience to date so we can know how to calibrate for that less than 20% threshold, just so for those who are keeping score at home.\nPeter Crawford: Yes. So that's maybe one we want to have you follow up with the IR team to kind of walk you through some of the numbers and the -- go through the smart reports to get to that level of detail on the timing on all of that. I think that's probably the best the best path on that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Fair enough. Maybe since that's a bit of a mulligan, maybe I'll try for my second question with something a little different. You give in the appendix some greater profile of the securities portfolio, which is really great and really helpful. When we're thinking about the potential for cash needs in the coming year as potentially sorting might happen a little faster, who knows. What does the profile of maturities in the securities book look like over the next roughly 12 months, let's say? Do you have an idea or a projection about how much cash will be generated from that portfolio?\nPeter Crawford: [Indiscernible] my mic here. So we certainly do. And definitely one of the things that we look to actively manage. Our overall portfolio duration now is down to about a little over 4%. It's probably more like 3.5-ish when you consider the cash we're holding more cash. And so we are definitely maintaining a much more liquid portfolio today, targeting new investments to be very short. Now that gives us a lot of asset sensitivity, but also gives us a lot of liquidity to be able to support a wide range of possible outcomes around this client activity.\nJeff Edwards: I'm stepping here with a couple of questions from the web console. I'm going to try to aggregate them. I think the first one here is for you, Rick. Given the recent backdrop and kind of shifting environment where have we seen clients kind of gravitate from an advice and asset management solution perspective? Where are they most interested?\nRick Wurster: Well, top line, I would say, our advice flows continue at pace, roughly in line with where they have been. The areas of particular interest, I would say, there continues to be interest in full-service wealth advice capabilities. So we're seeing flows into our Schwab Advisor Network program and we're seeing flows into our Schwab Wealth Advisory program, both of which are full-service wealth offering. So that would be the #1 theme we're seeing. Second theme I would highlight is that in this interest rate environment, we're seeing more interest in fixed income solutions. And so our acquisition of Wasmer Schroeder a couple of years ago has been timely as flows have increased, and Wasmer Schroeder has captured a meaningful share of those and is setting records each month in terms of flows into Wasmer Schroeder on our platform. And then the third thing I would say is we are seeing stability outside of those programs. So Windhaven and Thomas Partners, and different offerings you've heard about over the years have been stable and returned to inflows. The one area where we're running a little bit behind what we typically see would be our Intelligent portfolios. And I think that's to be expected in this period of more volatility where clients who tend to have lower balances are a little bit shy of making that commitment in a volatile equity market. But overall, our flows continue into the managed investing and wealth area. And those are the areas that have been of particular interest to clients.\nJeff Edwards: Great. And here, maybe one for Walt. Just around, let's say, Schwab's persistent and steady business momentum through shifting environments and a changing competitive landscape over the years. What are some of the main forces you'd attribute to this steady growth, secular growth? And anything that you note that's changing or evolving on that front?\nWalt Bettinger: Thanks, Jeff. I think Rick really did a great job of addressing this in his prepared remarks. But it starts with our long-time strategy Through Clients' Eyes. And we strive to make decisions that put the needs of our clients at the forefront. Basically, the golden rule applied in a business context, and we execute on our strategy by striving for no trade-offs. We've always believed that wonderful service, first-rate advice, quality client solutions. They can be delivered at a world-beating value that no trade-off is required there. Again, it might not be snappy and might not generate a lot of press, but serving others in the way that we would want to be served, it has been and is the right strategy in our view, for long-term growth. And in terms of changes, we're not really seeing any meaningful changes in this trajectory. I mean, obviously, different market environments are going to lead to modestly different client metrics as they always have. But as I spoke about earlier, our clients are long-term investors and they're remaining committed to their investing strategies even during this difficult environment.\nJeff Edwards: Operator, go ahead with the next caller.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So organic growth has deteriorated at the new retail trading platforms, and we want to get an update on the competitive dynamics in your retail business -- and really, if you could highlight what trends you're seeing from younger first-time investors.\nWalt Bettinger: So I'll take a first stab at that. Thanks for the question, Craig. The -- our retail business is continuing to perform very, very well with meaningful net new assets from our projection standpoint, actually outperforming some of the projections that we had anticipated. We continue to add, as you've seen significant new -- with over 1 million new brokerage accounts in the quarter. And I think what's very important for the one slide I discussed with more than half of our new-to-firm retail households under the age of 40 is, they're making up more than half of our new-to-firm net new assets. So these are real investors that have real money and they continue to come to Schwab in very significant numbers. So our retail business is very healthy. Our TOA ratios relative to the firms that we compete with for retail investors remain very, very healthy, and we're quite optimistic about that continuing despite the difficult environment.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you. And my follow-up, similar topic, retail trading platforms. So now that you're finishing up digesting your last set of deals. And I know one of them is going to take a couple more years for the revenue synergies really to kick in. But how would you think about inorganic opportunities relating to retail trading platforms, especially given that you're freeing up some excess capital, where these platforms could allow you to acquire a larger number of younger clients.\nWalt Bettinger: Well, I think we try to apply the same level of discipline and thoughtfulness to any M&A opportunity that we would in the future as we have in the past. We recognize that there may well be opportunities in the future, just as there have been in the past. We've looked carefully at everything that's been there in the past, and we'll look carefully at anything that may present itself in the future. That said, particularly given our strong profitability and capital creation, we would want to weigh any possible M&A activity against the other alternatives for deploying capital, including buying back stock in a company that we know very, very well. And have tremendous confidence in its ability to continue to grow organically, of course, I'm talking about Schwab. So we'll look at everything carefully, but it will be a meaningful threshold for us to consider deploying capital in a manner other than investing in a business as strong as ours.\nJeff Edwards: Coming in with one other kind of set of questions from the webcast. We've got some stuff, Peter, for you around AOCI and something that's been top of mind for folks. Maybe you could quickly hit on that just to address those questions.\nPeter Crawford: Sure. Thanks, Jeff. And so I've certainly read with some interest, a lot of the, I guess, the questions and the commentary about AOCI and whether this is going to impact our capital planning, our capital activities. And certainly understandable given the size of the AOCI. But frankly, our negative AOCI is not one of the top 30 things I worry about as CFO. And maybe it's important to set a little bit of context. Remember, these are mark-to-market unrealized losses. And they only matter from a regulatory standpoint, if we're over $700 billion in assets for 4 consecutive quarters. So -- it's not like we're going to suddenly -- we're not going to see this point coming well in advance. The other point is that AOCI goes down with lower rates. And it also amortizes steadily over time, about 15% or closer to 20% per year over the next 4 to 5 years. So the only scenario where it poses a problem is, if rates are high and balances are growing, which, of course, would be a scenario in which we're producing very, very strong net interest revenue, very, very strong earnings. And we also have the ability, if somehow we find ourselves in this situation to utilize our sweep tower to move some of those balances off our balance sheet into Sweep money funds. So I think the bottom line that you should take away is that AOCI considerations are not influencing our capital planning activities at all right now.\nJeff Edwards: Great. Thank you, Peter. Operator, maybe we have time for one more question from the queue.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Congrats to you, Walt as well. The -- just on to cash sorting, maybe just some clarifications on the appendix, the 6% to 10% drop in the balance sheet. First of all was that on an end of period total asset basis or average or interest -- or on interest-earning assets? And then, Peter, just your view of cash sorting past the Fed tightening cycle. So if the Fed were to stop at the -- let's say, by the end of the year, would you still expect to see a significant amount of cash sorting into 2023? Or do you think that really abates? And if I could squeeze one more in there on the BDA, I don't know if I missed this, but did you move any BDA assets over in July? And if you didn't, do you have the capacity to move $10 billion over this year?\nPeter Crawford: Okay. So that was 3 questions there. Let me see if I can take them all. I think what we saw in the last rising rate cycle is when the Fed stops raising rates, the sorting over time goes down. The pace of sorting goes down as the cash -- the most yield-sensitive cash moves and then, again, eventually the cash balance is fine the level and then start growing again. The assumption in the appendix, certainly encourage you to follow up with the IR team on that. It is end of period assets. And your third question about the BDA is that we'd have taken a lot of balances out of the BDA in the first half of the year. I wouldn't necessarily expect us to take more balances in the second half of the year necessarily. But I think it's important to remember, think of the BDA as almost like another interest-earning asset, and that it's about a 20% floating allocation, which reprices very quickly as Fed funds rate increases. It's got roughly -- if you look at the securities portfolio, it's just over 2, 2.5 years, somewhere in that range in terms of duration. And actually, if you look at the portfolio sort of maturity schedule, which we can also share with you, there's a period of time in a few years where some of the balances that we put on that we fixed during the last [indiscernible] environment start to roll off, which creates a really nice opportunity to pick up a significant amount of yield on the BDA or bring them over to our balance sheet over time.\nBrian Bedell: And if I could just follow up on the roll-off on the securities portfolio. Again, a great color on the appendix on the reinvestment rates. What are the current roll-off rates on that securities portfolio? And then do you have any update on the premium amortization from your last guidance in the first quarter?\nJeff Edwards: Brian, it's Jeff. That's something we can follow up with you. Peter, I think we're up on the hour, do you want to take it...\nPeter Crawford: Yes. So thank you. And certainly, thanks, everyone, for the questions and certainly thank you all for the time today. And we clearly spent a lot of time over the last several months discussing interest rates and cash balances, sorting, trading levels. I think what you've probably heard is, I certainly -- none of us can sit here and tell you exactly how those will go over the next few months or quarters. But one thing we remain very confident about is our outlook through the cycle. Confident in our long-term financial formula, which, those of you who followed the company for a while, recall as high single-digit to low double-digit client asset growth, including 5% to 7% organic growth, leading to a similar level of revenue growth. Expanding pretax margins through scale and expense discipline, which creates low double-digit earnings growth, which plus some amount of capital return creates mid-teens EPS growth. That formula remains as relevant today as ever. So you want to put all together what you see as a company poised to combine strong revenue growth over time with significant capital return. But also, I think this goes back to what Walt said, a company that isn't now and has never been satisfied, pressing ahead from a position of strength. Thank you all, and we'll look forward to talking with you again in October.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Crawford",
            "content": "Well, thank you very much, Rick. So Walt and Rick talked about our ability to build and maintain the loyalty of our clients despite the challenging environment and very low investor sentiment. How that loyalty has translated into continued robust organic growth? The strong positioning we have built around modern wealth management and our progress and plans for making that position even more formidable. In my time today, I'll talk about how the combination of strong business momentum, a more subdued, but still quite active client base and rising interest rates produced record financial performance in the second quarter. I'll also provide an updated outlook for the rest of the year, which demonstrates the power of our all-weather business model and the benefits we derive from higher rates. And finally, I'll provide an update on our capital planning with our capital ratios having reached their highest level since the pandemic began, enabling us to potentially accelerate our capital return activities. What you'll hopefully hear is that this company continues to drive exceptional operating and financial performance, that we're clearly benefiting from higher rates and are poised to benefit even more in the quarters ahead. But that's only part of the story. In short, we're demonstrating once again the enduring power of Schwab's strategy and business model, one that combines growth, profitability and capital return with a lot more opportunity ahead of us. Let's talk about some of the factors that contributed to our strong financial performance in the second quarter. Our performance was obviously helped by higher interest rates across the curve, which boosted our net interest margin and BDA yield and eliminated money fund fee waivers by the end of the quarter. While falling equity markets weighed on asset management fees, and the ensuing decline in investor sentiment that Walt talked about resulted in trading activity and margin utilization that were lower than the first quarter but still at historically high levels. What endures amidst this choppy environment is our unmatched ability to drive robust organic growth. Roughly $185 billion in core net new assets in the first half of the year despite record high tax payments by clients, and 5% growth in active accounts on the heels of the unprecedented new account formation we saw in the first half of 2021. Despite some cross currents, our financial performance in the second quarter broke multiple records. Revenue increased 13% year-over-year and 9% sequentially, driven by a 31% increase in net interest revenue reflecting a 16 basis point year-over-year increase on our net interest margin, are up 24 basis points from the first quarter and interest-earning assets that largely were in line with expectations. Flat asset management and administrative fees, as the elimination of money fund fee waivers and organic inflows offset the impact of the market decline. And trading revenue that was lower than last year despite a slight increase in daily average trades. We limited adjusted expense growth of 2% year-over-year, all of which helped produce an adjusted pretax margin of 49.5%, a record $2 billion in adjusted net income and a record $0.97 in adjusted EPS. That was the income statement. Let's turn our attention briefly to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet assets declined 4% year-to-date due mostly to those record tax payments in April as well as some sorting activity in the second quarter that was consistent with our expectations given the rate environment. Our strong earnings, combined with that slight decrease in assets, boosted our capital ratios to the highest level we've seen in roughly 2.5 years. Despite the challenging equity markets, we feel very confident about our ability to drive strong revenue growth and resume a higher pace of capital return. Assuming the Fed follows through as the market predicts with a Fed funds rate exiting 2022 at 3.5%, we'd expect to produce an 11% to 13% year-over-year increase in revenue despite the market downturn. That reflects continued expansion of our net interest margin to just over 2% by Q4. Deposit betas that we expect to continue to run a bit lower than the last rising rate cycle and a continuation of clients moving some of their investment cash off our balance sheet in search of higher yields. But remember, when they do that, it frees up capital that we can return to our stockholders. We continue to thoughtfully and responsibly manage our expenses, navigating this inflationary environment, driving efficiency throughout our business and prioritizing our investments to advance the strategic agenda that Rick discussed. Controlling for an increase in the pass-through fee that boosts both revenue and expense and which we do not control, our full year expense outlook remains the same as what we shared back in February. And with our inaugural CCAR submission now behind us, which demonstrated the strength of our balance sheet as reflected the fact that we're the only firm to see an increase in capital ratios during the stress event. And our capital levels in the mid-6s, we are nearing the point at which we can accelerate capital return. You saw that the Board approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.22 as well as a new $15 billion buyback authorization that we'd expect to utilize as soon as later this year and beyond. And at the same time, we also have the option of redeeming one or more of our outstanding preferreds. I want to close by picking up on a theme that Walt discussed in his opening comments, how this is as a company built and managed for the long term. So we're certainly pleased by our current financial performance despite the difficult macro environment. We are much more gratified by our ability to consistently drive a set of behaviors and outcomes that have enabled us to deliver for clients and stockholders for over 4 decades. Continuing to be the premier asset gatherer as indicated by our net new assets, new accounts and TOA ratio, a reflection of our Through Clients' Eyes strategy and formidable competitive position. Building a diversified and resilient business model that converts business growth into revenue growth, producing record revenue in the second quarter maintaining discipline in how we manage expenses, producing operating leverage through the cycle and increasing margins, which have now reached nearly 50% and have an opportunity to continue to climb and being very efficient in how we deploy the capital that has been entrusted to us or as we're now poised to do return excess capital back to our stockholders. Make no mistake, Challenging conditions in all this is a good environment for both our actual financial results and our future financial prospects, and we intend to pursue those prospects as we remain focused on serving clients and being good stewards of our stockholders' capital. With that, Jeff, let me turn it over to you to facilitate our Q&A. Thanks, Ken, for the question. So I would say, in aggregate, the dynamics around cash sorting in the second quarter were very consistent with our overall expectations. And I think this is -- I know there's going to be a lot of questions about sorting. So an attempt maybe to anticipate or perhaps preempt them. It might be helpful just to share a few high-level thoughts around sorting. I want to reiterate that our expectation is that the level of sorting won't be higher than the last rising rate cycle, and it actually could be somewhat lower given the fact that we're not going through the bulk transfer process that we're doing in the last rising rate cycle, that we have an influx of smaller accounts who tend to do less sorting. And we also have a client base that is much more actively trading than they were previously, and we know that when clients are trading, they tend to keep more transactional cash. Second, we know from history that eventually cash, both total cash and on balance sheet cash will find its level, after which point it will grow with the growth in accounts and the growth of total client assets. Third, and this is really important, the cash is staying at Schwab. We've done a lot to create a great array of cash solutions and we've done a lot and continue to do a lot to make our clients aware of those solutions, make sure they're making smart decisions with regard -- regarding their cash. We want our clients to be happy, and we want that cash to stay at Schwab, and that we're seeing -- certainly seeing that happen. Fourth, I think when you look at sorting in isolation, you're only really looking at one part of the equation. And what I mean by that is that the rate increases that give rise to the sorting also help us earn more on the interest assets that remain here, the cash that remains here. Driving NIR higher despite lower interest-earning assets. So in the scenario that we shared, if you do the math, as an example, you'll see that we'd expect to generate roughly $500 million more in net interest revenue in the fourth quarter than we did in the second quarter despite allowing for some continuation of the client cash sorting. And the last point I would make, fifth point I would make is to the extent that cash balances decrease, it frees up capital, enabling us to buy back stock and drive EPS growth one way or the other. Hopefully, that answers your question, Ken. Thanks, Rich. So you'll see in the appendix, we have a lot of detail around the assumptions in the scenario that we shared. And you'll see in the appendix an assumption that the balance sheet contracts by a similar aggregate level as what we saw in the first half of the year. Bearing in mind, of course, that the first half of the year was influenced by the tax payments in April as well as the changes in the mark-to-market value of the available-for-sale securities. And of course, in the second half of the year, you typically have a seasonal tax buildup in December. Sure. So thanks for the question. So in terms of the expense outlook, I shared in this scenario what the expense outlook would be for the full year. So looking at our typical seasonal pattern, you tend to see a little bit lighter expenses in the third quarter and a little bit heavier in the fourth quarter. So as you think about the math on that. I think the important point on expenses is, is we want to continue to drive down our expense on client assets through the cycle. And we want to continue to deliver operating leverage, which is a key part of our financial formula. At the same time, we want to make sure that we're investing in our clients and certainly the long-term growth of our business. That is certainly a delicate balance, but I think you've seen us manage that to achieve that overtime with EOCA declining and our margins increasing. So that continues to be our focus. Sorry, the second question -- part of your question was on -- try again. Sorry, the expense synergies yes. So we have roughly -- perhaps a little bit less than half of the overall expense synergies to deliver. We've said previously that the pace of delivery will be a little bit lighter now relative to the first year or 2 post acquisition. The next big unlock on those expense synergies will be as we complete the client conversions and can eliminate the duplicate systems and so forth that you should see a more meaningful portion of the expenses -- expense synergies materialize at that point in time. We continue to feel very confident in our ability to hit the expense synergy numbers that we have shared previously. So thanks for the question. So just to clarify, I think what we said in the spring business update that we didn't expect it to be higher than that level. And as I mentioned today, I think it could conceivably be lower than that. But you are right that when you think about the pool that we're talking about here, it is really that Bank Sweep and perhaps to a lesser extent, the free credit -- broker-dealer free credit balances you see in the pie chart. So it definitely is not on the total pool of cash. You're absolutely right about that. Yes. So that's maybe one we want to have you follow up with the IR team to kind of walk you through some of the numbers and the -- go through the smart reports to get to that level of detail on the timing on all of that. I think that's probably the best the best path on that. [Indiscernible] my mic here. So we certainly do. And definitely one of the things that we look to actively manage. Our overall portfolio duration now is down to about a little over 4%. It's probably more like 3.5-ish when you consider the cash we're holding more cash. And so we are definitely maintaining a much more liquid portfolio today, targeting new investments to be very short. Now that gives us a lot of asset sensitivity, but also gives us a lot of liquidity to be able to support a wide range of possible outcomes around this client activity. Sure. Thanks, Jeff. And so I've certainly read with some interest, a lot of the, I guess, the questions and the commentary about AOCI and whether this is going to impact our capital planning, our capital activities. And certainly understandable given the size of the AOCI. But frankly, our negative AOCI is not one of the top 30 things I worry about as CFO. And maybe it's important to set a little bit of context. Remember, these are mark-to-market unrealized losses. And they only matter from a regulatory standpoint, if we're over $700 billion in assets for 4 consecutive quarters. So -- it's not like we're going to suddenly -- we're not going to see this point coming well in advance. The other point is that AOCI goes down with lower rates. And it also amortizes steadily over time, about 15% or closer to 20% per year over the next 4 to 5 years. So the only scenario where it poses a problem is, if rates are high and balances are growing, which, of course, would be a scenario in which we're producing very, very strong net interest revenue, very, very strong earnings. And we also have the ability, if somehow we find ourselves in this situation to utilize our sweep tower to move some of those balances off our balance sheet into Sweep money funds. So I think the bottom line that you should take away is that AOCI considerations are not influencing our capital planning activities at all right now. Okay. So that was 3 questions there. Let me see if I can take them all. I think what we saw in the last rising rate cycle is when the Fed stops raising rates, the sorting over time goes down. The pace of sorting goes down as the cash -- the most yield-sensitive cash moves and then, again, eventually the cash balance is fine the level and then start growing again. The assumption in the appendix, certainly encourage you to follow up with the IR team on that. It is end of period assets. And your third question about the BDA is that we'd have taken a lot of balances out of the BDA in the first half of the year. I wouldn't necessarily expect us to take more balances in the second half of the year necessarily. But I think it's important to remember, think of the BDA as almost like another interest-earning asset, and that it's about a 20% floating allocation, which reprices very quickly as Fed funds rate increases. It's got roughly -- if you look at the securities portfolio, it's just over 2, 2.5 years, somewhere in that range in terms of duration. And actually, if you look at the portfolio sort of maturity schedule, which we can also share with you, there's a period of time in a few years where some of the balances that we put on that we fixed during the last [indiscernible] environment start to roll off, which creates a really nice opportunity to pick up a significant amount of yield on the BDA or bring them over to our balance sheet over time. Yes. So thank you. And certainly, thanks, everyone, for the questions and certainly thank you all for the time today. And we clearly spent a lot of time over the last several months discussing interest rates and cash balances, sorting, trading levels. I think what you've probably heard is, I certainly -- none of us can sit here and tell you exactly how those will go over the next few months or quarters. But one thing we remain very confident about is our outlook through the cycle. Confident in our long-term financial formula, which, those of you who followed the company for a while, recall as high single-digit to low double-digit client asset growth, including 5% to 7% organic growth, leading to a similar level of revenue growth. Expanding pretax margins through scale and expense discipline, which creates low double-digit earnings growth, which plus some amount of capital return creates mid-teens EPS growth. That formula remains as relevant today as ever. So you want to put all together what you see as a company poised to combine strong revenue growth over time with significant capital return. But also, I think this goes back to what Walt said, a company that isn't now and has never been satisfied, pressing ahead from a position of strength. Thank you all, and we'll look forward to talking with you again in October."

            "name": "Walt Bettinger",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for investing some time to listen-in on our July business update. So 3 months ago, I emphasized the word consistency during our time together. And I stressed the way consistency plays a critical role at Schwab. A consistent business strategy, a consistent commitment to feeding the virtuous cycle and innovating on behalf of investors, a consistent financial reporting cadence, a consistent commitment to our employees and the communities that we live and work in. And in a consistent long-term approach that is focused not just on the current year, but on years to come. And today, as we discuss our second quarter results and our viewpoint for the future, the benefits of our consistent strategy and commitment to clients, I think, is highly evident. Because it's times like these when investor's sentiment is negative when the equity markets are falling, these are the times that separate companies who chase headlines and/or focus on short-term success from a company like Schwab, a company built to last, a company built to succeed in all environments. By serving investors and advisers in good times and difficult times, while also delivering the superior financial results that you see. Now before we discuss the second quarter in a bit more specifics, I want to touch on the announcement this morning from our Board of Directors that I would be joining our founder, Chuck Schwab, as Co-Chair of our Board. Although it's personally a tremendous honor that Chuck and the Board have seen fit to entrust me with this additional responsibility, the reality is this announcement is not about me. Announcement is aligned with the consistency theme that I just spoke of. Consistency and continuity are hallmarks of Schwab. They add to a sense of confidence that our clients, our employees, stockholders and the communities where we live and work can rely on. Our consistent strategy that we refer to as to clients' eyes is not a catchy slogan. It's a timeless strategy. It's timeless because, in our view, it is the only business strategy that can stand the test of time. A strategy that places our clients at the forefront of the decisions we make. And a key part of my new responsibilities as Co-Chair of the Board will be to ensure that our focus on clients, our consistent focus on clients remains the hallmark of Schwab for years to come. As all of you know well, in the second quarter, the equity markets officially entered bear market territory. Volatility remained quite high and the Federal Reserve advanced their efforts to bring inflation under control by raising interest rates. And of course, this continued with another 75 basis point increase yesterday, moving the target rate to between 2.25% and 2.5%. Now not surprisingly, investors felt this pain. They felt the pain from the equity market declines with investor sentiment falling sharply and reaching levels that we haven't seen in many, many years. Interestingly, however, Schwab clients continued to invest for the long haul. I guess you could say consistency is a hallmark of our clients also. The net buy/sell ratio of our clients during the quarter as punishing as the second quarter was, was only modestly lower than it was during the meme stock quarter back in Q1 of last year. I guess the takeaway is that our clients are investors. And with well over 30 million investor accounts, yes, there are different approaches for certain. Some are buy and hold, some trade actively, some rely on an independent adviser. Of course, many are a combination of all these. But what's important is that collectively, they take a long-term view of the markets. Collectively, they understand the power of being in the market. Collectively, they know that consistency, again, is the path to success when it comes to long-term investing. This long-term focus by our clients is not an accident. It's an outcome of our purpose and our strategy at Schwab because we focus on attracting long-term investors and cultivating them on educating them on the power of long-term diversified investing and being in the market and staying in the market and being consistent with their investing strategies. And of course, there it is, again, that word, consistency. We believe that a major part of why our clients can feel confident with taking a long-term approach to their investing is the confidence that they have in us at Schwab. Despite, again, what anyone would describe as a relatively brutal equity and bond market of late. Our clients still give us Net Promoter Scores in the mid- to high 60s. And with our fastest-growing client base, high net worth investors offering us our highest scores overall. Our client easy score is now more than 90, reflecting our commitment to making it easy for our clients to do business with us. And meanwhile, 83% of our clients rate their phone-based service experience with us as perfect, a score of 7 out of 7. In addition to our efforts, of course, around ease of business and quality of service being recognized by our clients, we're gratified that many third parties do as well. The importance of service quality, timely and responsive service, it's especially critical during difficult times for investors because it's service quality that helps keep these investors informed, aware and as confident as possible. It contributes to client engagement and optimism for the future. I just encourage you not to make the mistake and think that given where the markets are that our clients are not highly engaged, optimistic and investing for the long term. And I think as evidence reflecting this optimism, our clients continue to add money to their investing strategies at a relatively high rate despite the bear market with annualized organic growth about 5% and really rather astonishing for a bear market, 6% when we exclude April. And of course, it's record-breaking levels of tax payments. So this is a picture of a strong, healthy company excelling during a quarter as difficult as any quarter in many years. But I think what's also incredibly important is it's a picture of a healthy client base. A client base taking a long-term approach to investing a consistent long-term philosophy. Now with over $180 billion in core net new assets in the first half of this year and our seventh consecutive quarter with over 1 million new brokerage accounts, our organic growth is indisputable. We still maintain a net TOA ratio of approximately 1.6:1. That means we're winning $1.60 from competitors for every dollar they win from us. Again, reflecting our competitive strength from a relative market is also there. Importantly, our efforts to ensure long-term organic growth continues as we diversify our client base. You can see that over half of our new to retail clients are under the age of 40 and they drove over half of our new client net new assets. So this is particularly important because it illustrates that not only are we winning in the under 40 segment. But we are winning under 40 investors with substantial investable assets, not simply winning younger investors who have little money with which to invest. And as we've repeatedly emphasized, our business-serving independent investment advisers continues its success serving the needs of all sizes of advisers. So we aim to provide the best platform for every RIA regardless of size or business model or specialty. And our success in winning clients of all shapes and sizes clearly indicates we're succeeding. Now while we continue to be the leader in serving the largest advisers, again, what's fascinating about this chart, is that our largest share of net new assets year-to-date have actually come from smaller advisers, those who manage less than $500 million. As we've repeatedly stated, and I don't know how many more times we can continue, but we will keep saying it, our RIA custody business is committed to serving advisers of all sizes, in a world-class manner and without charging custodial fees. So Rick, let me turn it over to you, and you can cover some more details of some of our efforts. Sure. Thank you, Rich. And also thank you for the kind words. I'm excited and as I mentioned, honored to add the additional responsibilities as Co-Chair to my duties as CEO. So of course, we all watched with great interest your interview with Chair Gensler. And we have great respect for the Chair as well, frankly, as his objective of striving to improve the trading experience for investors overall. I think in fairness, we have to wait and see what any actual proposal might be and what it might entail. It's also important for us to bear in mind that I think it's safe to say that retail investors have never had a better overall experience, including the quality and timeliness of their execution. It's difficult to comment on all the various items that Chair Gensler spoke on, but maybe I'll just identify the last one to provide some thoughts for everyone, around the idea from an auction. I mean, certainly, an auction idea is interesting. But I do worry a bit about whether it contemplates auctions in all different types of market environments. We know that in the current structure, execution, timeliness and speed is assured no matter what the environment is. And when I just take a step back, say, from the equity markets and just think of auctions in general, whether you're auctioning a home or art or something near and dear to my heart, baseball cards, since I'm a baseball card collector. Auctions tend to work really well when you have a favorable economic environment and a lot of liquidity in a system. And conversely, auctions tend to struggle during a more difficult economic environments or when there's less liquidity. And you start to get wide gaps and spreads between what maybe the seller in the case of an auction was hoping to receive and price what they actually receive. So again, I'm not suggesting that, that illustration says that an auction couldn't be workable. But I just think these are the kind of things that have to be very carefully thought through. The math needs to be done very thoughtfully and evaluated to see whether we're actually creating a better environment for investors overall. And I am confident that, that appropriate process will be followed if, in fact, these rules are formally proposed. Yes. That's -- it's a good question. So right now, I think the pipeline is as robust as we've ever experienced. But I believe your assumption is not an inaccurate one that when you have a more difficult equity market, that it is probably a little bit more difficult for advisers to move to independents, but it's probably a lag factor, which is why we're not seeing it reflected in our current book of business. I think more what you see in real time is that some investors who invest with advisers may be a bit more hesitant to move money under the management of that adviser during a very difficult market environment. So you probably get more near-term implication from that. And maybe a little bit more of a lag implication from a weaker equity market in terms of advisers moving to independents. But as of right now, our pipeline is as strong and robust as we've experienced. And we feel very optimistic about our ability to assist those advisers moving independents and moving their assets to us. Thanks, Jeff. I think Rick really did a great job of addressing this in his prepared remarks. But it starts with our long-time strategy Through Clients' Eyes. And we strive to make decisions that put the needs of our clients at the forefront. Basically, the golden rule applied in a business context, and we execute on our strategy by striving for no trade-offs. We've always believed that wonderful service, first-rate advice, quality client solutions. They can be delivered at a world-beating value that no trade-off is required there. Again, it might not be snappy and might not generate a lot of press, but serving others in the way that we would want to be served, it has been and is the right strategy in our view, for long-term growth. And in terms of changes, we're not really seeing any meaningful changes in this trajectory. I mean, obviously, different market environments are going to lead to modestly different client metrics as they always have. But as I spoke about earlier, our clients are long-term investors and they're remaining committed to their investing strategies even during this difficult environment. So I'll take a first stab at that. Thanks for the question, Craig. The -- our retail business is continuing to perform very, very well with meaningful net new assets from our projection standpoint, actually outperforming some of the projections that we had anticipated. We continue to add, as you've seen significant new -- with over 1 million new brokerage accounts in the quarter. And I think what's very important for the one slide I discussed with more than half of our new-to-firm retail households under the age of 40 is, they're making up more than half of our new-to-firm net new assets. So these are real investors that have real money and they continue to come to Schwab in very significant numbers. So our retail business is very healthy. Our TOA ratios relative to the firms that we compete with for retail investors remain very, very healthy, and we're quite optimistic about that continuing despite the difficult environment. Well, I think we try to apply the same level of discipline and thoughtfulness to any M&A opportunity that we would in the future as we have in the past. We recognize that there may well be opportunities in the future, just as there have been in the past. We've looked carefully at everything that's been there in the past, and we'll look carefully at anything that may present itself in the future. That said, particularly given our strong profitability and capital creation, we would want to weigh any possible M&A activity against the other alternatives for deploying capital, including buying back stock in a company that we know very, very well. And have tremendous confidence in its ability to continue to grow organically, of course, I'm talking about Schwab. So we'll look at everything carefully, but it will be a meaningful threshold for us to consider deploying capital in a manner other than investing in a business as strong as ours."

            "name": "Rick Wurster",
            "content": "Thanks, Walt, and hello, everyone. I'll spend the next few minutes talking more about why clients continue to turn to us in good times and in challenging times, and I'll share an update on several of our strategic initiatives. At the heart of our success is our Through Clients' Eyes strategy, which has been our consistent strategy for years. When we see Through Clients' Eyes, our priorities are clear. And what we continue to hear from clients is they want the combination of low-cost and high-quality experiences and solutions that deliver great value. The transparency that is the foundation of any trusted relationship, multichannel experiences that meet them where they are and ease. Clients expect their interactions with us to be easy. And they also want to consolidate as much of their financial lives as possible in the one place. The reason clients continue to turn to Schwab is our consistent no trade-offs approach that you've heard Walt talk about. At Schwab, clients don't have to choose between low-cost and stellar service. Access to some of the best service professionals in the industry and the digital and technology platforms and experiences they expect from a modern firm, straightforward foundational investment offers and more personalized solutions. Tools and capabilities for those who want to take investing into their own hands and a spectrum of advised offers that help clients get to where they want to go with the help of a professional. Proprietary and third-party products that give them the choice they want. They don't need to make any trade-offs because Schwab is uniquely positioned to deliver it all here with our strength as a wealth manager, as a bank and as an asset manager. Our size and our focus uniquely enable us to deliver for clients in a way that sets us apart in the industry. And this focus, which starts with seeing Through Clients' Eyes drives the virtuous cycle. This means we will continue to put clients at the forefront and challenge the status quo to benefit investors. And when we do that, investors will reward us by trusting us with more of their assets. This leads to consistent financial results and outstanding stockholder value, which enables us to continue to invest in our business to serve our clients' needs, and that brings us back to the start of the virtuous cycle. You see on this page what no trade-offs looks like for our clients. It is a competitive blended advice race, advise rate and the ability to talk to us quickly when you call for support. It is making investments to hire more client-facing employees who are there when a client walks in the door and investments in technology to make their experiences with us as easy as possible. It is a continuum of offerings ranging from straightforward to personalized that meets the needs of investors who are just starting out and the needs of our high net worth clients who are seeking advice. It is industry-recognized tools and resources for self-directed investors and advised offerings that continue to attract investors with more complex financial needs. And it is the product choice that our clients want. Our consistent strategy is supporting our clients through a challenging environment. At the same time, we remain focused on strengthening our offer to meet client needs into the future through our strategic focus areas. First, we're achieving even more scale and efficiency. Integration remains our #1 priority. The integration is bringing capabilities that make our combined offering experiences stronger than either firm was on its own. Our Schwab clients will benefit from thinkorswim, iRebal and thinkpipes, while our Ameritrade clients will benefit from the advice capabilities, banking solutions and digital experiences at Schwab. Together, our no trade-offs approach is even stronger. As we look to client day 1 beginning in 2023, we have already multiplied the scalability in our systems and increased our capacity to support client needs and growth well into the future. For example, we've increased systems capacity to support the volumes of the combined company with plenty of capacity for spikes in transaction volumes. The modernization work on our platforms has made them both more resilient as well as much easier to scale as the client base continues to expand. Our systems now support 4 to 6x the previous volume of transactions with faster processing times across the board, including for trades and client communications. We also remain focused on eased, making it easier for clients to do business with us and enhancing our operating model to support future growth. We're essentially accelerating several years of digital transformation into the integration window, enabling us to support a smooth client transition, deliver on our expense synergy commitments and limit expense growth after client conversion. Turning now to win-win monetization opportunities. We remain focused on 3 key areas: wealth management, asset management and lending. And I'll speak more about wealth and asset management in a moment, and I'll start with lending. The bank continues to be a differentiator for Schwab. We won the J.D. Power Award for being ranked highest in customer satisfaction with direct retail banking 4 years in a row. When we look at our lending business, even in the current interest rate environment, our TOA portfolio balance or pledged asset line portfolio balance was $14.8 billion, 42% above the prior year. And as we look ahead, we're excited to roll out a number of enhancements that will make it even easier to go through the loan process at Schwab. Finally, we're doing more to meet the segmented needs of our clients, including our high net worth clients, RIAs and other key client segments. As Walt mentioned in his opening comments, a key aspect of being an enduring company is serving a broad range of clients and continuing to meet their needs as their circumstances and behavior change. We compete, however, against a number of firms that focus on specific client segments to successfully compete against these firms, we will stay focused on our clients and leverage our scale to meet the needs of the various client segments that we serve. I'll wrap up today with a deeper look into how we're delivering a continuum of wealth management experiences, and I'll share more about our Trader segment in particular. Looking at the continuum of our wealth management offer, we have attractive full-service wealth programs and investing solutions that clients are turning to in the current market environment. When you look at our full-service wealth programs, we recently rebranded our premier wealth management offer Schwab Private Client, to be named Schwab Wealth Advisory to better reflect what the offer does for clients. We are investing in the offer, including enhancing our digital experience, providing resources and support to advisers to ensure even greater advice and service and bringing more of our wealth expertise at Schwab to the client. We also have investing solutions that clients often use as a part of their portfolio. With the increase in interest rates, we've seen record flows into Wasmer Schroeder on the Schwab platform. We've also launched new personalized investing solutions to complement the core offering. Schwab personalized indexing launched and is delivered for clients in a volatile market and has delivered on the promised tax savings. We continue to make progress on expanding our thematic investing offer. And in the second quarter, we further expanded our ESG tools with the introduction of MSCI's ESG ratings for individual stocks. There is tremendous opportunity ahead to enhance the wealth management experience. Over time, we'll look at providing a discretionary wealth management experience for clients and have plans to add digital capabilities to meet clients where they are. Now I'd like to turn to the work we are doing to support traders, one of our key segments. One of the benefits of integration is we will be able to offer Schwab and Ameritrade clients a leading end-to-end trading experience with thinkorswim, one of the strongest active trader platforms in the industry. In August 2020, we announced plans to adopt thinkorswim and integrate its award-winning trading platforms, education and tools into our trader offerings for clients. This will provide our trader clients with 3 interconnected channels of engagement across desktop, web and mobile, all integrated with one another. It's enhanced trading experiences and comprehensive set of trading tools across the product space, supporting equities, options, ETFs, futures and foreign exchange trading and a tightly integrated trade and portfolio analysis capability. In fact, we recently rolled out new enhancements that reinforce our commitment to the thinkorswim platform, including providing clients with greater opportunities for customization. And in April, we launched a virtual active trader branch. Here, active trader financial consultants focus on trader coaching and wealth management to help meet the unique needs of qualifying self-directed traders. Finally, I'd point out that one of our biggest focus area for our trader clients is trading platform stability. Nothing is more important to our business than safeguarding our systems and ensuring our clients have reliable access to their accounts. I'll wrap up where Walt started, with our Through Clients' Eyes approach as our consistent strategy, we continue to be there for our clients even as the market has become more challenging for them. This approach sets us apart in the industry and puts us in a strong competitive position, allowing us to continue to invest in the strategic initiatives that will meet client needs into the future, while enabling the outstanding financial performance that Peter is about to discuss. So Peter, over to you. Thank you for the question. First thing I would say as it relates to your specific question, Ken, on T. Rowe, I would say that it's very early days. We're just getting that program going. We are seeing some enthusiasm for it among our clients. And we are seeing a simpler process that we've built around our clients finding the product that they want to be well received by our clients. So we're making it easier for clients to find the right product for them. In terms of specifics, I would say that we've launched the T. Rowe program into a challenging market, where we're seeing both active management and interest and equities declined to some extent because of the volatility in the market. And so we've seen some headwinds, but with those headwinds, of course, I'd bring it back to our all-weather model when active management is out of favor, passive is in favor, and we've seen strong growth in our ETF business. We're third this year in flows with relatively strong inflows. So again, we think about it as an all-weather model. And importantly, we also think about delivering the choice clients want. So the program is doing exactly what we'd want it to so far. We've got plans in the future to leverage the program to a greater extent. And we're also investing in our experience for advisers through an institutional no transaction fee platform, I think shows again our commitment to delivering for advisers. In terms of your final part of your question, Ken, I think the philosophy of making sure that we create a win-win deal for clients for ourselves and for managers is important and one that we will continue to strike across our third-party platform. So that's certainly a part of our future plans. Well, top line, I would say, our advice flows continue at pace, roughly in line with where they have been. The areas of particular interest, I would say, there continues to be interest in full-service wealth advice capabilities. So we're seeing flows into our Schwab Advisor Network program and we're seeing flows into our Schwab Wealth Advisory program, both of which are full-service wealth offering. So that would be the #1 theme we're seeing. Second theme I would highlight is that in this interest rate environment, we're seeing more interest in fixed income solutions. And so our acquisition of Wasmer Schroeder a couple of years ago has been timely as flows have increased, and Wasmer Schroeder has captured a meaningful share of those and is setting records each month in terms of flows into Wasmer Schroeder on our platform. And then the third thing I would say is we are seeing stability outside of those programs. So Windhaven and Thomas Partners, and different offerings you've heard about over the years have been stable and returned to inflows. The one area where we're running a little bit behind what we typically see would be our Intelligent portfolios. And I think that's to be expected in this period of more volatility where clients who tend to have lower balances are a little bit shy of making that commitment in a volatile equity market. But overall, our flows continue into the managed investing and wealth area. And those are the areas that have been of particular interest to clients."

And first off, we want to thank you for spending some time with us today. And as always, we hope everyone on the call and your families remain safe and well as the pandemic continues on its, knock wood, downward path.\n We do have a full program today, including our President, Rick Wurster's inaugural interim update participation. So let's do a quick administrative review and get right into it.\n As the holding slides indicated, Walt, Rick and Peter are the presenters today. The program remains at 60 minutes with Q&A following prepared remarks. Jeff Edwards will once again moderate the Q&A session. We'll take questions from the dial-in and the webcast console. [Operator Instructions] Also as before, we will post the slides on the IR site as Peter begins his remarks. And finally, please make note of the forward-looking statement language, as always.\n And with that, Walt, will you start us off? \nWalter Bettinger: Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning. Consistency, it's a word that I spend a lot of time on, and it's a word that is critical at Schwab. It means that we're committed to a consistent business strategy, a consistent commitment to feeding the virtuous cycle of innovating on behalf of investors, a consistent financial reporting cadence, a consistent commitment to our employees and the communities that we live and work in and a consistent long-term approach. It's focused not just on the current year but on years to come.\n But when I talk about consistency, I also want to emphasize that it doesn't mean that we have to be slow or stodgy or unwilling to be disruptive. Frankly, I don't think I've ever heard anyone refer to Schwab as unwilling to be disruptive. But it does mean that clients can count on us through good times for investing as we enjoyed much of last year as well as more difficult times. It means that they know we work hard to improve on our shortcomings and that we will continue to innovate, enhance and keep their best interest at the forefront of our firm.\n I think as all of you know who have followed our company, taking a long-term client-centric approach, it's not always easy. But after almost 14 years as CEO, I'm as committed as ever to my belief that it is really the only path to rewarding long-term stockholders. And in the first quarter of this year, we executed on that exact approach despite it being a tough quarter for investors.\n And clients continue to reward us with their business, over 1 million new brokerage accounts, over $120 billion in net new assets. We're just going to continue investing to better serve them and innovate on their behalf. Importantly, we're also going to remain consistent in our strategic approach, Through Clients' Eyes, and that is our North Star.\n So let's take a look at some of the details from the first quarter and the implications for our long-term emphasis. It was, I guess, you could say a fairly brutal quarter for investors, whether they were conservative, aggressive or anywhere in between. So we had 4 decade-high inflation, and the resulting anticipated increase in interest rates really punished fixed income investors. And of course, the equity market declined rather sharply before we saw a modest comeback a bit late in that first quarter.\n But despite it being a difficult quarter, again, clients continued to trust us. They continued to bring their hard-earned investment dollars to Schwab and opened new accounts with us. We maintained an organic growth rate in terms of core net new assets at the same consistent level we've been able to deliver for over a decade. We've done that in good times. We've done it in more difficult times. And of course, we've done it even as we've grown larger, had a much larger base, and therefore, presumably more challenging.\n Taking a look at the next slide, investor sentiment felt pretty hard during the quarter. It turned quite a bit negative, then we had a small recovery in the market late again in the quarter, created a little bit of a lift off the floor from where we were in sentiment. But we saw the sentiment manifest itself throughout the quarter, things like margin loan balances falling about $6 billion from year-end. And although trading activity was relatively robust overall, I think as Peter is going to discuss in his section, the mix of those trades changed and reflected much more of what we might consider a risk-off viewpoint by investors.\n But again, with our commitment to consistency, it means we're -- we don't slam on the gas or slam on the brakes depending on environmental factors that are going on around us. Instead, we're -- our strategic efforts are designed to enhance services to clients for years to come, deliver financial benefits to stockholders over the years. So as you would expect, we will continue making investments for the long term consistent with the 3 key strategic initiatives that we've shared with you multiple times.\n And Rick, maybe I can turn it over to you, and you can spend a bit of time discussing some of those efforts. \nRick Wurster: Thank you, Walt, and hello, everyone. I'm thrilled to be here today to share an update on the progress we have made this year to advance our key strategic initiatives. Walt talked about consistency. Our actions continue to be guided by our Through Clients' Eyes strategy. With that as our North Star, we're focused on the 3 actions that you see on this page: achieving even more scale and efficiency, pursuing win-win monetization and meeting the segmented needs of our clients. In this quarter, we've made progress on all fronts, and I'd like to start by sharing some of the updates on scale and efficiency.\n In the first quarter, the key measure of our scale and efficiency, our expense on client assets, or EOCA, was 15 basis points or 13 basis points on an adjusted basis. Although that's up slightly from recent levels due to seasonal expenses and the market decline, we continue to believe that this lower cost to serve provides us with a competitive edge.\n To illustrate the power of the investments we've made in digital and technology capabilities, I think it is remarkable that we have bolstered our trading system capacity by more than 5x over the last 5 years. To put that in perspective, this means that we have the ability within a handful of minutes to handle the same system volume we would have handled in an entire day only a few years ago.\n As we think about the future for us in scale and efficiency, our top priority remains consistent: the integration of Ameritrade. And we made consistent and more progress on this front in the first quarter of this year, including duly licensing Ameritrade financial consultants. This has a number of important benefits, including making client day 1 easier and providing the opportunity to introduce our wealth management capabilities and improving retention and win-win monetization.\n Speaking of win-win monetization, I spoke in January about 3 areas where we see the opportunity to help more clients and to drive growth, and those areas are asset management wealth management and lending. I'm going to focus my comments today on 2 of those areas, asset management and lending.\n On the proprietary asset management side, I am thrilled to share that last week, we launched Schwab Personalized Indexing. Our proprietary launch provides tax benefits to investors. It brings the minimum on our platform for direct indexing down to $100,000 from the $250,000 level that it was at for the third-party product that has been on our platform. Yet that $100,000 minimum is still at a level where we think meaningful tax benefits can be provided to clients.\n And finally, we launched at 40 basis points for retail clients and 25 basis points for advisers, which are very competitive fee points. You can expect us to continually innovate in this area, and stay tuned for more updates as it relates to personalization and a digital experience within our personalized indexing offer.\n In February, we launched our new strategic relationship with T. Rowe Price. This launch has a number of client benefits, including providing RIAs with no transaction fee access to T. Rowe's -- T. Rowe Price's lowest-cost institutional share class funds.\n Turning now to lending. I've talked previously about the potential upside to enhancing our lending offer for both IS and AS clients. Most importantly, I think this would be a win for clients. Clients are asking to do their bond through Schwab, and we know they can access our industry-leading low rates here.\n We've made a lot of progress on this front this year. We've cut our pledged asset line. Our PAL cycle time is down significantly. We've created a new lending experience for our ultra-high net worth clients. And we've worked with Rocket Mortgage to make it easier for our $5 million-plus clients to get a mortgage. All of this has resulted in our Client Promoter Scores for lending being at 77 in the first quarter, which is near all-time highs, suggesting clients are seeing the value from this offer.\n Let me wrap up with sharing a bit more on our efforts to meet the specific needs of our client segments. As I mentioned earlier, seeing Through Clients' Eyes is our North Star, and we made progress this quarter to meet the needs and preferences of a range of investors, and I want to share an update on that.\n For trading-oriented and newer clients, we launched Thematic Stock List in March. This is an innovative new tool that will help trading-oriented and newer clients identify themes that may be of interest to them and help them identify investment and trading opportunities. We have over 45 themes available for clients today, including a number of ESG-related themes. You can expect from us additional advancements as it relates to this capability and the way we deliver to clients over time.\n Turning now to our high net worth client segment. This client segment grew at 5x the rate of retail households year-over-year. And we continue to enhance our advice, our service and our offers like lending to make sure that they meet the specific needs of our high net worth clients.\n More broadly, we've continued to make progress to build out our relationship support model. We've added financial consultants, wealth strategists and other professionals to make sure that investors at Charles Schwab feels supported. For our trader clients, we've established the first-ever Ameritrade Active Trader FC branch. For our ESG investors, we've recently launched MSCI ESG ratings on individual stocks that our clients can use to evaluate the investment decisions they're making alongside other criteria that they like to look at. This new resource on ESG adds to other enhancements that we've made in the past year for ESG investors, including the launch of the Schwab Ariel ESG ETF, the Wasmer Schroeder positive impact strategy launched last year, ESG-related themes that can be found in the Thematic Stock List, and access to an ESG index as part of our recent Schwab Personalized Indexing launch.\n And finally, we also have an RIA client segmentation strategy. Our AS model is designed to serve clients of all sizes, from clients just starting their businesses to large multifamily offices and everywhere in between. Late last year, we segmented our client base into 3 subsegments to tailor support to the needs and priorities of our different advisers. Early results show this specialization or segmentation has been immensely successful with client satisfaction up and improved service.\n As we look ahead, you will continue to see the consistency of our strategy. With Through Clients' Eyes as our North Star, we will continue to put our clients first as we make progress on these important initiatives.\n And with that, I will turn it back to Walt. \nWalter Bettinger: Thanks, Rick. It's a wonderful summary of several of the efforts going on across the firm to better serve our clients and build stockholder value over time.\n Someone asked me in a meeting Tuesday morning, they said, \"Walt, what are you going to do about the decline in SCHW that happened on Monday?\" And it probably shouldn't surprise any of you what my answer was. I said, \"It's pretty simple. We're going to keep focusing on our clients and our prospects. We're going to keep executing on the virtuous cycle. We're only scratching the surface of the available domestic market with about 12% penetration.\"\n And when we do those things well, I'm confident in our future prospects. We never panic. We never try to pull rabbits out of the hat. We're never going to try and make short-term results by deviating from an approach that has worked for 50 years.\n So just to wrap things up in my segment, yes, it's a tough environment for investors. But our all-weather financial model performed quite strongly during a period of market turbulence. And when I look out through the course of 2022, I am very optimistic about our earnings potential. More on that will come from Peter.\n But no matter how the year unfolds, you can count on the fact that we will remain consistent in the areas that matter most: a strategy based on seeing the world Through Clients' Eyes, a set of competitive advantages that we continue to enhance, a commitment to the virtuous cycle that continually rewards our clients, our employees and our long-term stockholders. We'll keep making progress on our key strategic initiatives that Rick referenced, and we'll keep making progress on the integration of TD Ameritrade. And we'll do it all in a consistent manner with a winning strategy, Through Clients' Eyes.\n So Peter, I know a lot of folks are anxious to hear from you. So let me turn it over to you for a look at our financials. \nPeter Crawford: Excellent. Well, thank you very much, Walt. So you all heard Walt and Rick talk about the continued success we're having winning clients in spite of somewhat more subdued investor sentiment and engagement; the progress we're making in bringing new solutions to our clients and advancing our strategic priorities; and finally, about the huge opportunity we have to broaden our moat and continue to drive strong organic growth.\n In my time today, I want to talk about how our all-weather business model helped us produce results. They were off last year's record level but still quite strong considering the various headwinds we faced. I'll discuss our evolving investment management thinking and how we're positioned to benefit significantly if the Fed hikes rates as expected.\n And finally, I'll provide an update on our capital management approach moving forward. The message you should hear is that regardless of how someone might have viewed our recent quarter's financial results, our Through Clients' Eyes strategy is working and our business model is working, producing strong financial performance with the potential for an acceleration of revenue growth in the quarters ahead should the Fed follow through on their tightening cycle.\n So let's talk about some of the cross-currents that influenced our financial performance in the first quarter. At our winter business update a few months ago, we highlighted some of the questions that would shape our operating and financial performance in 2022. As Walt talked about, the quarter was a challenging one for our clients and investors in general.\n As we look at the quarter from the context of our business model, some of the developments have been helpful: the decline in COVID cases, clearly; the rise in long-term interest rates; and continued robust trading activity. While others have presented challenges, specifically rapidly rising inflation; a Fed funds rate, which, of course, is expected to rise dramatically over the next several quarters, but which remain near 0 for most of the quarter; a decline in equity markets that Walt referenced; and a less exuberant attitude among investors in general and our clients in particular.\n Now despite some of those challenging dynamics, we were able to deliver financial performance that was a bit below last year's record level but still quite solid. As we said previously, with the acquisition of Ameritrade, we are more exposed to dynamics that can fluctuate in less predictable ways: trading behavior, margin utilization and securities lending to name a few. In Q1, the risk off sentiment among clients impacted all these drivers and weighed on our results, resulting in revenue that was down 1% from the unprecedented Q1 of 2021. Now we limited growth in adjusted expenses to 4% year-over-year, which produced an adjusted pretax margin close to 45%, a 26% return on tangible common equity and $0.77 of adjusted EPS.\n Comparing conditions to the financial scenario we shared in January. The equity market decline has obviously been a negative while the Fed hiked in March consistent with our scenario. Trading activity was a bit higher than the scenario contemplated. But as we'll discuss in a moment, as Walt previewed, the mix of trades was different than what we saw last year, which produced lower revenue per trade.\n The scenario seemed consistent securities lending revenue and margin utilization, but both were down from the fourth quarter, 20% in the case of sec lending, which, of course, adversely impacted our net interest margin and revenue. And balance sheet growth tracked a little higher than contemplated in this scenario given the strong asset gathering and somewhat lower net purchase activity by clients.\n It's always a little tricky comparing results for a single quarter with a scenario that covers the full year, especially given the assumption in the January scenario for 2 more rate hikes in 2022, which should increase revenue growth and pretax margins in subsequent quarters. But our financial results thus far have been pretty close to what the scenario anticipated for the first quarter.\n And on the expense side, our results were very much consistent with our financial plan, meaning that we're sticking with our expectation for full year adjusted expense growth of 6% to 7%, excluding, of course, any variation based on our bonus funding.\n I mentioned earlier that even as overall trading activity has remained quite robust. We have seen some changes in the types of trades being made, which on balance have reduced the revenue per trade versus the fourth quarter as we previewed in the commentary attached to our February SMART report.\n Our RIA clients are being relatively more active. And while derivatives continue to account for 23% of total trades, we're seeing an increase in futures trades as well as options activity on indices relative to individual equities. We also saw a decline in the size of the average options trade. So all these factors taken together combined to lower revenue per trade by roughly 10% versus the fourth quarter of 2021.\n It's too early, of course, to know whether this mix shift is an anomaly or a trend, but we're certainly glad our platform can meet a broad and sometimes varying range of needs across retail and RIA clients, equities, futures and options, small and large trades.\n Turning our attention to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet grew another 2% sequentially driven by more than $20 billion increase in bank deposits due to strong asset gathering and our migration of $12 billion or $13 billion in cash out of the IDA.\n Within our interest-earning assets, the decline in equity markets prompted a decline in margin utilization. While we're continuing to be very successful in increasing adoption of our compelling bank lending solutions with balances up another $2.5 billion in the quarter and 46% over the last 12 months. We're active on the financing front, issuing $3 billion of debt to supplement parent liquidity and $700 million in preferred to support the balance sheet growth we've experienced.\n Stockholders' equity declined due to mark-to-market unrealized losses on our AFS or available-for-sale portfolio due to higher interest rates. This is a good moment to remind you all that we moved approximately $111 billion of securities from AFS to held to maturity at the end of January, insulating from AOCI further changes in their unrealized gain loss. Now the loss at the time of that transition was $2.4 billion, which will amortize as those securities mature. And that negative AOCI does not impact regulatory capital. So our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio remained just north of 6%.\n As I mentioned earlier, our financial performance was helped only modestly this quarter by the increase in interest rates to start the year. But going forward, that should change with Schwab poised to see tremendous lift should the Fed pursue what is expected to be a dramatic increase in rates. The path of our net interest margin will always depend on how rates ultimately trend as well as how our clients manage their cash, how we manage our investment portfolio and of course the level of the securities lending revenue and margin utilization.\n Now as you saw in our earnings release, our net interest margin decreased 6 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2022. That decrease was entirely due to a lower contribution from securities lending and margin utilization as well as an increased allocation of cash, which more than offset a 7 basis point sequential improvement in the yield on our investment portfolio.\n Looking forward, if the Fed hikes rates to a range of 2.25% to 2.5% by the end of the year, as the market currently expects, we could see our net interest margin climb to the mid-1.80s in Q4. So while our NIM declined in Q1, the upside to higher rates still very much exists.\n So now let's talk about some of the factors that influence our NIM trajectory. The most important factor, of course, is what ultimately happens with rates. We talk a lot, both Rick and Walt referenced, our Through Clients' Eyes strategy and we talk about it in the context of our business priorities and approach. But we also adopt a similar lens in our investment approach. And what I mean by that is that we don't change our investment strategy based off our own in-house view of what is going to happen with rates in the future. Instead, we take market expectations as an input and then adjust our investment strategy based on how we think clients might respond, which ultimately influence our liability duration, our liquidity planning to support the client behavior and deposit pricing.\n Over time, the amount of cash our clients hold tends to grow with the growth in accounts and the growth in total client assets and how much of that cash sits on our balance sheet, primarily in our bank sweep and broker-dealer free credit products. Well, that varies based off the level of primarily short-term interest rates. When the Fed funds rate increases, solutions like purchase money funds and CDs are able to offer more meaningful yields. So clients tend to move more of their so-called investment cash off our balance sheet into these higher-yielding alternatives. It's what we've called client cash sorting.\n Now in 2015 to 2019, the client cash sorting produced a roughly 20% reduction in uninvested or sweep cash balances over a 3-year period once the Fed started tightening until those balances resumed growing again. Now assuming the Fed follows through as expected, we would expect that process to return. The 2015 to 2019 period is a reasonable reference point for our expectations this cycle, but there are a number of different dynamics this time around that could influence that behavior.\n At the same time, we'd expect to see continued growth in bank lending, as Rick discussed, as we improve the PAL process, make our lending solutions available to legacy Ameritrade clients and continue to increase awareness of our very competitive mortgage rates. And given the way the LCR, or liquidity coverage ratio, calculation works, we need to maintain stable or even growing free credit balances within the broker-dealers to support our margin book. So any sorting that happens there needs to be replaced by transferring balances out of bank sweep.\n Now with higher rates, we'd also expect paydowns to slow. Now we have plenty of liquid assets and borrowing capacity to support outflows. But we'd rather not sell assets potentially at a loss or have to rely on higher-cost FHLB borrowing on a long-term basis. So we need to ensure we have enough liquidity at the banks to enable these client cash allocation changes without selling securities or borrowing from the FHLB.\n Our investment portfolio in aggregate looks pretty similar to how it looked 1 year ago with a fixed floating allocation of 90-10 and a duration around 4.7. But those numbers are higher than in 2015, which means that the upside from higher rates is very much still there, though the benefit will accrue to us over a longer period of time than the last rising rate cycle.\n We are, however, carrying more cash in the portfolio. 15% or 16% versus our typical 5% to 7% level. This decision to hold more cash wasn't about market timing. Though in hindsight, it was good we didn't deploy the cash earlier in the quarter when rates were much lower than where they are now. But it does give us more flexibility and increases our upside to higher rates.\n We're also repositioning the portfolio and targeting our investments to ensure we have a lot of maturities in the next 2 to 3 years. And while the yield curve is quite flat, we are sacrificing some amount of current net interest revenue to maintain this higher level of liquidity. But I emphasize current because this is just a timing difference. If the Fed follows through its plan that the yield trade-off will decrease steadily and this approach obviously increases our asset sensitivity and upside to higher rates.\n As we look to the future, we would expect deposit betas to be no higher than they were during the last rising rate cycle. And that is a function of our cash strategy through which we offer our clients access to higher-yielding cash alternatives within their brokerage accounts for their investment cash, allowing us in our flagship bank suite product, which is the repository of what we call transaction cash or cash awaiting investment to offer a yield that is somewhat lower, but still quite compelling relative to the checking account rates offered by the big banks.\n And finally, a word or two on capital. With the continued growth on our balance sheet, our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio declined slightly to 6.1%, below our operating objective but well above the regulatory minimum. I've read some commentary on our negative AOCI mark and the potential impact that could have on our regulatory capital. As a reminder, for some of you who may be less familiar with the issues involved, mark-to-market gains and losses in our AFS portfolio do not flow through the P&L, but do impact stockholders' equity through a line item called accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI.\n Now as a Category 3 institution below $700 billion in assets, we have the option, which we have taken, to exclude AOCI from our regulatory capital ratios. As of 3/31, AOCI was negative $11 billion. But again, that doesn't impact our regulatory capital. It will only do so if and when we cross $700 billion in assets and stay there for 4 consecutive quarters. And while we are close to that level today, the client cash sorting that should accompany higher rates will mean a slowing or even reversal of balance sheet growth, which means we may not hit that trigger for some time. At which point that AOCI mark will have amortized down somewhat.\n So what that means is higher rates mean that the $700 billion threshold gets pushed out, while lower rates mean that the negative AOCI gets reduced. Either way, we see this as something that is quite manageable.\n Let me close with a few thoughts. It's obviously been a turbulent week for the stock, as Walt referenced and frankly, a turbulent start to the year. And we're cognizant of the impact that has on all of you, our owners. At the same time, we continue to focus on the things that we can control. And the measures that we look at as indicators of the value of the business have stayed remarkably consistent: organic growth, whether measured by net new assets or new accounts; our Net Promoter Score or what we call Client Promoter Scores, which have reached new highs despite the market turbulence; our TOA ratio and the wins we see from competitors; and the progress we're making on our strategic agenda. Those are the most important barometers regarding the health of the business and are all giving us confidence that we're on the right track.\n With that, Jeff, let me turn it over to you to facilitate our Q&A. Thanks. \nJeff Edwards: Great. Thank you very much, Peter. Let's go ahead and turn to the phone lines. Operator, first question, please? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question today is from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. \nKenneth Worthington: So you mentioned that you're building cash on the balance sheet in part as a function to prepare, I think for cash sorting is how I interpreted it. And there is a benefit of being able to invest for higher rates in the future. How much cash do you want to or feel you need to have on hand in coming quarters to meet these needs? And is this 15% level that we saw in the first quarter the right level that you would expect to be at in future quarters? Or should it go higher before it starts to go lower? \nPeter Crawford: Yes. Thanks, Ken, for the question. So I would expect that level of cash. It's not like we're holding the cash because we think that sorting is going to happen this quarter or next quarter. It's really looking out over the next several years and thinking about how do we want to make sure we position the portfolio such that we have ample liquidity to be able to support a range of possible outcomes around this client cash sorting.\n I would expect that, that level of cash will come down over time through some of the purchase activity that we outlined in one of those pages there. For example, we're considering deploying some of it into kind of a treasury ladder, for example, that would be an alternative to that cash would lock in some of the forward rates, protect us from some of the downside in case rates don't climb as expected. But I would still expect -- even that, I would expect that our cash levels will still remain higher than that 5% to 7% typical level that we target. \nKenneth Worthington: Okay. And then can you help us think about the timing of investing some of the cash as it goes into your built-up cash? At what point do you start to invest and maybe further take advantage of the better rate environment? So I know you said it wasn't your goal to time the market, but you've built up cash. Do we start to see more deployment of this cash in the next 1 to 2 quarters? Or does it make more sense given the shape of the curve to maybe sit on cash, not just for sorting purposes, but for the fact that if you hold cash now and wait 2 or 3 quarters in the future, you can get an even better yield, and therefore, NIM would be much better off by waiting? \nPeter Crawford: Yes. Well, as you said, we don't -- we definitely don't try to time the market. So it really is a function of what we see with that client -- what we see with the rate environment, what we see with that client activity. I do expect that we'll deploy some of that cash over the next couple of quarters, but we'll likely be deploying that in -- or continue to deploy that in securities that have a relatively short maturity so that we have a lot of paydowns and maturities in the next 2 or 3 years.\n In terms of the timing to go out further on the curve to be buying some of the traditional mortgage-backed securities that we have traditionally bought, that's really going to be more a function of what we see with client activity and to see how that evolves over time. \nOperator: And our next question is from Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. \nCraig Siegenthaler: Peter, I appreciate your updated commentary on AOCI. But it looks like you're going to cross $700 billion over the next few quarters. You're only about 3% away now. However, it seems like you disagree with this just given your expectation for cash sorting. So I was just wondering if you could elaborate on the comment you made in the prepared remarks. \nPeter Crawford: Sure. So I guess the short answer, Craig, is it depends. I think that it's certainly conceivable that we could cross within the next couple of quarters. It's also conceivable that if the client cash sorting evolves in a manner consistent with what we saw in 2015 through 2019, that could slow the balance sheet growth or potentially even reverse some of that balance sheet growth and push that date further back.\n So I guess either way, I would say we feel like it's a manageable issue for us to navigate. By virtue of -- I mean we're certainly cognizant of the implications on our regulatory capital. But sitting here as CFO and thinking about the profile of the business and how much capital do we need to support the business, it's not like an accounting convention changes the fundamental profile of the company. When we think about how we manage our capital and the level of capital that we want to maintain to support the business, when we think about our stress test, the most stressful scenario for us is interest rates go down and cash floods onto the balance sheet.\n Well, scenario like that, that negative AOCI goes away and basically goes back to 0 with the decline in interest rates. So it's sort of an example where again we think this is a very manageable situation. In a scenario where rates are continuing to be high, that's also a scenario we're likely generating a lot of organic capital and probably utilizing less of that organic capital to support the balance sheet growth. So we're generating a lot of excess capital in that scenario. So again, we think this is a very manageable situation. \nCraig Siegenthaler: And then Peter, for my follow-up, once you do, if you do cross $700 billion and you exist there for 4 quarters, how do you expect to manage the capital through this process? And I'm thinking like what additional levers do you have to avoid a large impact to excess capital? And I know you migrated some securities in January from AFS to HTM. Can you do more? And also your business model looks different 5, 10 years ago. But are you able to move client cash sweep deposit liabilities back into money market funds like if that -- if it ever was an issue with capital? \nPeter Crawford: Well, I mean, again, our capital levels, we have buffers on top of buffers on top of buffers. So we've got -- we feel like we're sitting on a lot of capital even sitting where we are today at 6.1% Tier 1 leverage. We certainly wouldn't want to do anything that sacrifices the long-term growth of the business. So the idea of saying, \"Let's somehow cap our growth below $700 billion,\" I wouldn't necessarily see that as a path that we want to pursue.\n We did -- as you mentioned, we did migrate those $111 billion of securities out of available for sale to held to maturity really before we saw a dramatic rise in rates. So that really has been helpful. And to the extent we were buying new securities on the margin, we would be likely to put those into held to maturity assuming it was an appropriate fit with the security. So those are all actions that certainly will continue to look at.\n And a lot of the purchasing we're doing by targeting securities with a duration or maturity less than 3 years, those don't generate much AOCI volatility. So that helps us. And some of this AOCI, of course, amortizes down over time. So again, that's all makes the point, I think -- help support, I guess, why we feel like this is a very manageable situation. \nOperator: Our next question is from Devin Ryan from JMP Securities. \nDevin Ryan: So I guess another question here just on the balance sheet. So on the NIM commentary for 4Q by kind of mid-1.80s, what is the expectation at that point for prepay amortization? What's the assumption there? How much drag, I guess, is left? I think you have about 50 basis points today. So what's embedded? And then in terms of just the mix and thinking about kind of the loan book, you obviously have some good traction on mortgage lending and refinance activity as you guys talked about. It seems like that might slow here just in the rising rate environment. So maybe talk a little bit about kind of the outlook for growing the loan book. And are there other products that could offset that? And even would you do an acquisition to kind of accelerate other areas of loan growth? \nPeter Crawford: Sure. So on the prepayment amortization, we saw about a [indiscernible] basis point reduction in premium amortization between Q4 and Q1. And embedded within that NIM outlook that we shared is our expectation that again assuming rates continue as they have, that we can see another similar-sized reduction between Q1 and Q2 and probably between Q1 and Q4, somewhere on the order of 10 basis points, plus or minus improvement in the premium -- the level of premium amortization.\n In terms of of loan growth, we do -- despite the rising rate environment, we do think there's a lot of opportunity for growth. Clearly, the refinancing wave has largely passed, and we're entering on the mortgage side, a new purchase -- it's more of a new purchase market. But our rates are very, very compelling. And the -- still, despite the success we've had with growing our lending solutions, there's still a lot of clients out there who don't yet turn to us for their lending needs, who would be better off turning to us for their lending needs. It's good for them and it's good for us both financially and strategically. So we still think there's a big opportunity there with both the Schwab clients as well as now with the legacy Ameritrade clients to increase the awareness of the Schwab Bank capabilities, pricing, et cetera.\n And then with pledged asset line, Rick referenced the improvement in cycle times. That's -- I think that continues to be a big opportunity. We are very much underpenetrated in that product relative to other wealth management firms. And so we're working hard to again increase the awareness, improve the process there to make that more accessible to both retail clients as well as the RIA clients. The RIA clients have a lot of interest in pledged asset and so we think there's a big opportunity there. So we think there's a lot of opportunity on the lending side without a doubt. \nDevin Ryan: Yes. Great. Okay. A quick follow-up. Obviously, I think enthusiasm around the personalized indexing and the direct indexing opportunity. Is there any way to frame out kind of the trajectory and opportunity there, kind of how you think about the impact of Schwab or the size of the market over time as that continues to scale? \nUnknown Executive: Absolutely. I'll share a few thoughts on that. First, one of the things that's exciting to us about this launch is that it's an advice product that appeals to a broad range of investor types, including those self-directed clients at Schwab, who maybe haven't previously been interested in advice here at Schwab. So we're excited about the fact that it opens up -- opens us up to a broader set of clients that may be interested in it.\n In terms of thinking through the scale and how it may grow, there's, I think, around $14 trillion that sits in active mutual funds today. I believe last quarter, something like $140 billion came out of active mutual funds, and ETFs grew by about $200 billion. So there's a lot of money sitting there that may be interested in something like this.\n And I think there's 2 primary reasons why some of that money may move over time. One clearly is taxes. I think if you go back and study this, there can be somewhere around a 2% return improvement through harvesting taxes. And so for the taxable investor, the opportunity to participate in that return stream and pay a 40 basis point fee looks like an attractive option relative to even a low-cost ETF and perhaps against some active strategies. So I do think there will be some appeal to mutual fund and ETF investors.\n But I also believe that this is a product that if you walk down the street and ask someone, \"Hey, do you want a direct indexing or when people come into our offices?\" they've never heard of the product before by and large. And so one of the real powers I think that Schwab brings to the table as it relates to personalized indexing is I think success is going to take 3 things: one, it's going to take strong indexing skills; two, it's going to take digital capabilities; and importantly, number three, it's going to take distribution. Because in the near term, this product is going to have to be sold. It's going to have to be explained. The benefits are going to have to be shared with clients as to why that's helpful. And so I really think we're in a unique position, and we're excited for the growth.\n I do think next 5 or 10 years, as Walt has put it before, I think a freight train of money will move into this area and I believe we're perfectly positioned to play a big role. \nOperator: Our next question is from Rich Repetto from Piper Sandler. \nRichard Repetto: I guess my question first is on the impact of Fed -- incremental Fed fund rate hikes. It helps, Peter, that you gave us the exit NIM for what you expect if the Fed hike is as sort of the curve is projecting. But I guess my question is, you took -- you don't have in the sensitivity the impact of the next Fed funds rate hike. And these rate hikes are certainly going to have spillover effects in 2023. So I think we can back into this, but you might be able to help us. What is the incremental impact do you see of Fed fund rate increases beyond the first 2 or 3 when you recover the waivers -- the money market fund fee waivers? \nPeter Crawford: Well, thank you, Rich, for the question. I do think that's something we're likely to include when we have our July update as we get further into this cycle. As you point out, the next couple of Fed funds increases, we'll get the benefit, of course, from the increase itself plus the impact on the money fund fee waivers. Those money fund fee waivers should all be gone after the next, certainly, one or potentially 2 Fed increase. I think probably the next one, they're pretty much all gone at that point.\n The next couple after that, certainly, you've got the very quick benefit on roughly 40% to 45% of our balance sheet interest -- or our interest-earning assets that are in floating rate securities today. So that benefit kicks in relatively quickly and you can do the math in terms of that.\n The deposit betas, as you may recall from the last rising rate cycle, they started off on the lower end and then they start -- they do edge up over time after we get above sort of 100, 125 basis points. But they never -- I don't think they ever got above, I want to say, 25% or 30% even at sort of a 2% Fed fund or 2.5% -- 2.25%, 2.5% Fed funds rate. So that the incremental benefit of the eighth Fed -- 25 basis points Fed increase is slightly less than the benefit of the seventh, but there's still certainly significant upside as you start to stack some of these Fed funds increases on top of each other. \nRichard Repetto: Got it. That's helpful, Peter. And then one follow-up and back to this client cash sorting. So we see that the slide you put up, I think, it's 24. And at least it feels like you've been conservative when you say that the balance sheet, you could see some contraction. And you have a low of -- the 11.4% is low, it looks like historically from Slide 24. But when we looked at it last time, the purchase money market funds as a percentage of overall client cash, it got -- right now, it's about 13%. It got a lot higher last cycle like multiple times. So I guess the question is, is that sort of what you're sort of implying when you talk about balance sheet? Like that would be a big balance sheet contraction, I suspect. Is that a good metric to sort of judge where client cash sorting can go? \nPeter Crawford: Well, we use that -- we mentioned that, Rich, as a reference point, not as a prediction -- there are a number of different dynamics this time, this go around, right? We're not going through the bulk transfer. We're not executing the bulk transfers as we did last time when those bulk transfers were a catalyst for some clients to take action with regard to their cash.\n We have the Ameritrade clients now in their accounts, which tend to be smaller and more trading-oriented. So -- and they didn't have access to necessarily -- or certainly to the same access to purchase money funds in the last rising rate cycle. So we don't necessarily have great information in terms of how they'll behave. We have a lot of new accounts that we picked up in the last 1.5 years that oftentimes are smaller and more trading-oriented, so how they behave as well.\n And so given all of that, we feel like it's appropriate to make sure we are planning for different scenarios in terms of how this could unfold and then maintaining -- and that's really the key word is maintaining that flexibility so that we don't box ourselves in and we can respond under depending on how things evolve. \nOperator: Our next question is from Brennan Hawken UBS. \nBrennan Hawken: Actually sort of a follow-up on the -- Richard's questions. When we think about the BDA and you think about sweep as a percentage of client cash as you laid out, would you include the BDA when you think about a comparable set? I'd think that you wouldn't, but just want to clarify. And then the BDA that you pulled into the balance sheet here this quarter, is that all we should expect for 2022? Or is there more optionality? I know there are some wrinkles in that agreement, which could allow for some additional transfers. \nPeter Crawford: So let me take the second question first. Hard to say. We certainly have the option to take additional balances over the course of the year. At this point, I'm not sure I would expect a lot more additional migrations out of the BDA or the IDA onto our balance sheet in 2022.\n In terms of the upside on the BDA or IDA, you're absolutely right, it is very much there. About 20% of those balances are in floating rate and those are tied to the Fed funds rate. So as the Fed increases, you get the upside on 20% of $140-something billion pretty quickly. And we are executing new fixed investments about 90 basis points higher than the roll-off rate on those fixed maturities or those tenors that are maturing over the next 12 months. So a lot of upside in terms of the fixed portion of the IDA as well. \nBrennan Hawken: Great. And then it seems like the NIM trajectory you provided has securities lending at a similar level to the first quarter. So that makes sense. But when we think about the change we've seen in securities lending revenue, sorry, how much of that is due to less specials or hard to borrow versus lower balances or spreads? And how much could spread -- improving spreads with higher rates help that line going forward? \nPeter Crawford: Yes. That's a really interesting question. So our securities lending operation tends to focus more on the hard-to-borrow stocks. And so we're lending out stocks that oftentimes have a 99% rate -- annualized rate. So certainly very -- these are very high-spread securities, very much in demand that can generate a lot of -- certainly a lot of revenue.\n And the -- and so when you look over time, the interest in those hard-to-borrow stocks tends to correlate with the sentiment in the market. And so -- and the availability as well of those hard-to-borrow stocks varies with the sentiment in the market. In other words, when our clients have higher-margin balances that tends to correlate to an extent with more securities lending revenue.\n Now in a higher rate environment -- so for those of you who don't know as much about securities lending, when we lend out the stock, we do get cash as collateral from the counterparty. We have to lock up that cash in the reserve portfolio and it earns what the reserve portfolio earns. In a higher rate environment, of course, the cash that we receive, we can earn a higher yield on that cash.\n Oftentimes, though, that does when the counterparties are thinking about the rebate rates, they do factor that into the rebate that they're willing to give us. So in other words, if you have a stock that might be -- they might be willing to pay, let's say, 10% per year for in an environment where the cash that we're receiving doesn't earn much. If we're earning 2% on that cash, maybe they'll be willing to pay 8% in rebate.\n And so if you're looking forward, if you're looking at the reported securities lending revenue, you might see the direct securities lending revenue being lower, but it's being made up for by earning more on the cash, which sits in another place on the income statement. \nUnknown Executive: Peter, a question from the web console from Daniel Fannon at Jefferies. I know you mentioned that you'd be revisiting a, we'll say, a more formal update to the scenario later in the year as things continue to unfold. But maybe you could spend a little bit of time talking about some of the potential upside that we might see or that could be available due to additional rate hikes if they were to manifest. \nPeter Crawford: Sure. So I mean there's a number of different -- certainly a number of different dynamics at play there. So then again, the next couple of rate hikes, the $54 million of money fund fee waivers, we'd expect those to be completely eliminated by -- assuming the Fed follows through, be completely eliminated by the end of the second quarter. So going into the third quarter, we've got the full fees that we're capturing there.\n We have, I think, most recently -- look, I think we've got 43% of the interest-earning assets are in floating rate securities. Those tend to reprice very, very quickly. And so you take 43% times $600-plus billion interest-earning assets and you get that benefit on that very quickly with each Fed increase.\n The other -- to the extent that we're -- the rates are continuing to follow the forward curve and continue to climb, then that gives us more opportunity as we are doing -- executing new purchases to be picking up yield. That will play out over time given the duration of our investment portfolio. We do get that paydown activity and those maturities on that investment portfolio and that creates new field to be able to reinvest at those higher rates. And then as I had mentioned, with the IDA, you've got the 20% in floating roughly. That reprices relatively quickly -- or very quickly.\n And then we have the roll-on versus roll-off rate in the IDA. We're picking up that 90 basis points. Again, that's more of a function of long-term rates. But certainly, with those being where they are today, that creates certainly some nice wind in our backs on the IDAs as well. \nOperator: Our final question today is from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. \nBrian Bedell: Just back to the balance sheet strategy size, Peter. Maybe just some thoughts on how you would manage that given the flexibility that you're -- that you've been gearing up for, if we think about client cash that's coming in with net new asset growth, maybe some commentary on what percentage of that cash -- or what percentage of NNA typically comes in. And I know it takes a while to reinvest. So you've got that. And then would you try to be flexible on that balance sheet size? And maybe would that influence your decision to bring more BDA assets on, if you -- let's say you wanted to stay in the upper 600s as opposed to if there was more cash owing that brought that balance sheet down? \nPeter Crawford: Sure. So let's see. Let me again take the second part of the question first. Executing on the transfers on the IDAs, as I mentioned, I wouldn't expect that we're going to do -- we already took the $12 billion, $13 billion thus far this year. And I wouldn't expect us to do a lot more on the IDA migrations this year. We'll have to see you kind of where we are next year as we get into our planning and how we think about that.\n In terms of investing in new cash flows, that is absolutely part of our consideration as we see those cash flows come in. We do make a decision. But it's part of the overall mosaic, if you will, around how we think about our investment strategy. It's not like we think about new cash differently than we do with the cash that's generated from paydowns and maturities and so forth. We're looking at doing multiple forecasts over several years to sort of think about how conditions could evolve over time and making sure we are adjusting our asset duration, maturity schedule, liquidity positioning to be able to respond to a range of possible scenarios for that. \nBrian Bedell: Great. And my last question is for Rick, actually. Given the high net worth expansion strategy, I guess, thinking also about advisory services in the RIA business, can you talk about making alternatives available on your platform, obviously, with the theme of democratization of alternative investments and still some 1% to 2% types of allocations and clamoring for that? Are you seeing demand from your clients, your advisers as well? And are there plans to add a lot more capabilities for alternatives on to your platform? \nRick Wurster: Thanks for the question. I'd say 2 things. First, we have a tremendous amount of resources available for clients today in the alternative space on both adviser services and investor services. We are working -- so that's number -- point number one. Point number two, there is growing in greater demand for alternatives. And we know that there are some enhancements we can make particularly on the retail side. And so you can expect to see from us in coming periods more development on that front.\n We have a nice range of alternative-related options available for retail clients today, but we also believe we can go to the next level in terms of the types of vehicles and strategies that our investor services clients can access. So you can expect more development from us on that front what we think is already a strong base of appealing options that both our adviser clients and investor services clients can take advantage of today. \nPeter Crawford: All right. Well, that brings us to the top of the hour. I just -- I want to thank you all for your questions. Walt used the word consistency in his opening remarks, and I think that's a very apt word to describe our business strategy as well as our ALM and investing strategy. I'd also use the word humility in it, humility to understand. There's a lot happening right now in the environment that we don't necessarily -- we can't completely predict. We can't necessarily completely predict what investor sentiment is going to do, what the Fed is going to do, what's going to happen with interest rates. And so given that humility, we also want to make sure we maintain a lot of flexibility. That is the overarching word, I guess, or the sentiment that characterizes our investing strategy and how we're positioning the company, the balance sheet, et cetera, moving forward. But we're very excited, very confident for what the future will bring both financially and strategically and we look forward to giving you another update in July. Thanks, everyone.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Crawford",
            "content": "Excellent. Well, thank you very much, Walt. So you all heard Walt and Rick talk about the continued success we're having winning clients in spite of somewhat more subdued investor sentiment and engagement; the progress we're making in bringing new solutions to our clients and advancing our strategic priorities; and finally, about the huge opportunity we have to broaden our moat and continue to drive strong organic growth.\n In my time today, I want to talk about how our all-weather business model helped us produce results. They were off last year's record level but still quite strong considering the various headwinds we faced. I'll discuss our evolving investment management thinking and how we're positioned to benefit significantly if the Fed hikes rates as expected.\n And finally, I'll provide an update on our capital management approach moving forward. The message you should hear is that regardless of how someone might have viewed our recent quarter's financial results, our Through Clients' Eyes strategy is working and our business model is working, producing strong financial performance with the potential for an acceleration of revenue growth in the quarters ahead should the Fed follow through on their tightening cycle.\n So let's talk about some of the cross-currents that influenced our financial performance in the first quarter. At our winter business update a few months ago, we highlighted some of the questions that would shape our operating and financial performance in 2022. As Walt talked about, the quarter was a challenging one for our clients and investors in general.\n As we look at the quarter from the context of our business model, some of the developments have been helpful: the decline in COVID cases, clearly; the rise in long-term interest rates; and continued robust trading activity. While others have presented challenges, specifically rapidly rising inflation; a Fed funds rate, which, of course, is expected to rise dramatically over the next several quarters, but which remain near 0 for most of the quarter; a decline in equity markets that Walt referenced; and a less exuberant attitude among investors in general and our clients in particular.\n Now despite some of those challenging dynamics, we were able to deliver financial performance that was a bit below last year's record level but still quite solid. As we said previously, with the acquisition of Ameritrade, we are more exposed to dynamics that can fluctuate in less predictable ways: trading behavior, margin utilization and securities lending to name a few. In Q1, the risk off sentiment among clients impacted all these drivers and weighed on our results, resulting in revenue that was down 1% from the unprecedented Q1 of 2021. Now we limited growth in adjusted expenses to 4% year-over-year, which produced an adjusted pretax margin close to 45%, a 26% return on tangible common equity and $0.77 of adjusted EPS.\n Comparing conditions to the financial scenario we shared in January. The equity market decline has obviously been a negative while the Fed hiked in March consistent with our scenario. Trading activity was a bit higher than the scenario contemplated. But as we'll discuss in a moment, as Walt previewed, the mix of trades was different than what we saw last year, which produced lower revenue per trade.\n The scenario seemed consistent securities lending revenue and margin utilization, but both were down from the fourth quarter, 20% in the case of sec lending, which, of course, adversely impacted our net interest margin and revenue. And balance sheet growth tracked a little higher than contemplated in this scenario given the strong asset gathering and somewhat lower net purchase activity by clients.\n It's always a little tricky comparing results for a single quarter with a scenario that covers the full year, especially given the assumption in the January scenario for 2 more rate hikes in 2022, which should increase revenue growth and pretax margins in subsequent quarters. But our financial results thus far have been pretty close to what the scenario anticipated for the first quarter.\n And on the expense side, our results were very much consistent with our financial plan, meaning that we're sticking with our expectation for full year adjusted expense growth of 6% to 7%, excluding, of course, any variation based on our bonus funding.\n I mentioned earlier that even as overall trading activity has remained quite robust. We have seen some changes in the types of trades being made, which on balance have reduced the revenue per trade versus the fourth quarter as we previewed in the commentary attached to our February SMART report.\n Our RIA clients are being relatively more active. And while derivatives continue to account for 23% of total trades, we're seeing an increase in futures trades as well as options activity on indices relative to individual equities. We also saw a decline in the size of the average options trade. So all these factors taken together combined to lower revenue per trade by roughly 10% versus the fourth quarter of 2021.\n It's too early, of course, to know whether this mix shift is an anomaly or a trend, but we're certainly glad our platform can meet a broad and sometimes varying range of needs across retail and RIA clients, equities, futures and options, small and large trades.\n Turning our attention to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet grew another 2% sequentially driven by more than $20 billion increase in bank deposits due to strong asset gathering and our migration of $12 billion or $13 billion in cash out of the IDA.\n Within our interest-earning assets, the decline in equity markets prompted a decline in margin utilization. While we're continuing to be very successful in increasing adoption of our compelling bank lending solutions with balances up another $2.5 billion in the quarter and 46% over the last 12 months. We're active on the financing front, issuing $3 billion of debt to supplement parent liquidity and $700 million in preferred to support the balance sheet growth we've experienced.\n Stockholders' equity declined due to mark-to-market unrealized losses on our AFS or available-for-sale portfolio due to higher interest rates. This is a good moment to remind you all that we moved approximately $111 billion of securities from AFS to held to maturity at the end of January, insulating from AOCI further changes in their unrealized gain loss. Now the loss at the time of that transition was $2.4 billion, which will amortize as those securities mature. And that negative AOCI does not impact regulatory capital. So our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio remained just north of 6%.\n As I mentioned earlier, our financial performance was helped only modestly this quarter by the increase in interest rates to start the year. But going forward, that should change with Schwab poised to see tremendous lift should the Fed pursue what is expected to be a dramatic increase in rates. The path of our net interest margin will always depend on how rates ultimately trend as well as how our clients manage their cash, how we manage our investment portfolio and of course the level of the securities lending revenue and margin utilization.\n Now as you saw in our earnings release, our net interest margin decreased 6 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2022. That decrease was entirely due to a lower contribution from securities lending and margin utilization as well as an increased allocation of cash, which more than offset a 7 basis point sequential improvement in the yield on our investment portfolio.\n Looking forward, if the Fed hikes rates to a range of 2.25% to 2.5% by the end of the year, as the market currently expects, we could see our net interest margin climb to the mid-1.80s in Q4. So while our NIM declined in Q1, the upside to higher rates still very much exists.\n So now let's talk about some of the factors that influence our NIM trajectory. The most important factor, of course, is what ultimately happens with rates. We talk a lot, both Rick and Walt referenced, our Through Clients' Eyes strategy and we talk about it in the context of our business priorities and approach. But we also adopt a similar lens in our investment approach. And what I mean by that is that we don't change our investment strategy based off our own in-house view of what is going to happen with rates in the future. Instead, we take market expectations as an input and then adjust our investment strategy based on how we think clients might respond, which ultimately influence our liability duration, our liquidity planning to support the client behavior and deposit pricing.\n Over time, the amount of cash our clients hold tends to grow with the growth in accounts and the growth in total client assets and how much of that cash sits on our balance sheet, primarily in our bank sweep and broker-dealer free credit products. Well, that varies based off the level of primarily short-term interest rates. When the Fed funds rate increases, solutions like purchase money funds and CDs are able to offer more meaningful yields. So clients tend to move more of their so-called investment cash off our balance sheet into these higher-yielding alternatives. It's what we've called client cash sorting.\n Now in 2015 to 2019, the client cash sorting produced a roughly 20% reduction in uninvested or sweep cash balances over a 3-year period once the Fed started tightening until those balances resumed growing again. Now assuming the Fed follows through as expected, we would expect that process to return. The 2015 to 2019 period is a reasonable reference point for our expectations this cycle, but there are a number of different dynamics this time around that could influence that behavior.\n At the same time, we'd expect to see continued growth in bank lending, as Rick discussed, as we improve the PAL process, make our lending solutions available to legacy Ameritrade clients and continue to increase awareness of our very competitive mortgage rates. And given the way the LCR, or liquidity coverage ratio, calculation works, we need to maintain stable or even growing free credit balances within the broker-dealers to support our margin book. So any sorting that happens there needs to be replaced by transferring balances out of bank sweep.\n Now with higher rates, we'd also expect paydowns to slow. Now we have plenty of liquid assets and borrowing capacity to support outflows. But we'd rather not sell assets potentially at a loss or have to rely on higher-cost FHLB borrowing on a long-term basis. So we need to ensure we have enough liquidity at the banks to enable these client cash allocation changes without selling securities or borrowing from the FHLB.\n Our investment portfolio in aggregate looks pretty similar to how it looked 1 year ago with a fixed floating allocation of 90-10 and a duration around 4.7. But those numbers are higher than in 2015, which means that the upside from higher rates is very much still there, though the benefit will accrue to us over a longer period of time than the last rising rate cycle.\n We are, however, carrying more cash in the portfolio. 15% or 16% versus our typical 5% to 7% level. This decision to hold more cash wasn't about market timing. Though in hindsight, it was good we didn't deploy the cash earlier in the quarter when rates were much lower than where they are now. But it does give us more flexibility and increases our upside to higher rates.\n We're also repositioning the portfolio and targeting our investments to ensure we have a lot of maturities in the next 2 to 3 years. And while the yield curve is quite flat, we are sacrificing some amount of current net interest revenue to maintain this higher level of liquidity. But I emphasize current because this is just a timing difference. If the Fed follows through its plan that the yield trade-off will decrease steadily and this approach obviously increases our asset sensitivity and upside to higher rates.\n As we look to the future, we would expect deposit betas to be no higher than they were during the last rising rate cycle. And that is a function of our cash strategy through which we offer our clients access to higher-yielding cash alternatives within their brokerage accounts for their investment cash, allowing us in our flagship bank suite product, which is the repository of what we call transaction cash or cash awaiting investment to offer a yield that is somewhat lower, but still quite compelling relative to the checking account rates offered by the big banks.\n And finally, a word or two on capital. With the continued growth on our balance sheet, our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio declined slightly to 6.1%, below our operating objective but well above the regulatory minimum. I've read some commentary on our negative AOCI mark and the potential impact that could have on our regulatory capital. As a reminder, for some of you who may be less familiar with the issues involved, mark-to-market gains and losses in our AFS portfolio do not flow through the P&L, but do impact stockholders' equity through a line item called accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI.\n Now as a Category 3 institution below $700 billion in assets, we have the option, which we have taken, to exclude AOCI from our regulatory capital ratios. As of 3/31, AOCI was negative $11 billion. But again, that doesn't impact our regulatory capital. It will only do so if and when we cross $700 billion in assets and stay there for 4 consecutive quarters. And while we are close to that level today, the client cash sorting that should accompany higher rates will mean a slowing or even reversal of balance sheet growth, which means we may not hit that trigger for some time. At which point that AOCI mark will have amortized down somewhat.\n So what that means is higher rates mean that the $700 billion threshold gets pushed out, while lower rates mean that the negative AOCI gets reduced. Either way, we see this as something that is quite manageable.\n Let me close with a few thoughts. It's obviously been a turbulent week for the stock, as Walt referenced and frankly, a turbulent start to the year. And we're cognizant of the impact that has on all of you, our owners. At the same time, we continue to focus on the things that we can control. And the measures that we look at as indicators of the value of the business have stayed remarkably consistent: organic growth, whether measured by net new assets or new accounts; our Net Promoter Score or what we call Client Promoter Scores, which have reached new highs despite the market turbulence; our TOA ratio and the wins we see from competitors; and the progress we're making on our strategic agenda. Those are the most important barometers regarding the health of the business and are all giving us confidence that we're on the right track.\n With that, Jeff, let me turn it over to you to facilitate our Q&A. Thanks. Yes. Thanks, Ken, for the question. So I would expect that level of cash. It's not like we're holding the cash because we think that sorting is going to happen this quarter or next quarter. It's really looking out over the next several years and thinking about how do we want to make sure we position the portfolio such that we have ample liquidity to be able to support a range of possible outcomes around this client cash sorting.\n I would expect that, that level of cash will come down over time through some of the purchase activity that we outlined in one of those pages there. For example, we're considering deploying some of it into kind of a treasury ladder, for example, that would be an alternative to that cash would lock in some of the forward rates, protect us from some of the downside in case rates don't climb as expected. But I would still expect -- even that, I would expect that our cash levels will still remain higher than that 5% to 7% typical level that we target. Yes. Well, as you said, we don't -- we definitely don't try to time the market. So it really is a function of what we see with that client -- what we see with the rate environment, what we see with that client activity. I do expect that we'll deploy some of that cash over the next couple of quarters, but we'll likely be deploying that in -- or continue to deploy that in securities that have a relatively short maturity so that we have a lot of paydowns and maturities in the next 2 or 3 years.\n In terms of the timing to go out further on the curve to be buying some of the traditional mortgage-backed securities that we have traditionally bought, that's really going to be more a function of what we see with client activity and to see how that evolves over time. Sure. So I guess the short answer, Craig, is it depends. I think that it's certainly conceivable that we could cross within the next couple of quarters. It's also conceivable that if the client cash sorting evolves in a manner consistent with what we saw in 2015 through 2019, that could slow the balance sheet growth or potentially even reverse some of that balance sheet growth and push that date further back.\n So I guess either way, I would say we feel like it's a manageable issue for us to navigate. By virtue of -- I mean we're certainly cognizant of the implications on our regulatory capital. But sitting here as CFO and thinking about the profile of the business and how much capital do we need to support the business, it's not like an accounting convention changes the fundamental profile of the company. When we think about how we manage our capital and the level of capital that we want to maintain to support the business, when we think about our stress test, the most stressful scenario for us is interest rates go down and cash floods onto the balance sheet.\n Well, scenario like that, that negative AOCI goes away and basically goes back to 0 with the decline in interest rates. So it's sort of an example where again we think this is a very manageable situation. In a scenario where rates are continuing to be high, that's also a scenario we're likely generating a lot of organic capital and probably utilizing less of that organic capital to support the balance sheet growth. So we're generating a lot of excess capital in that scenario. So again, we think this is a very manageable situation. Well, I mean, again, our capital levels, we have buffers on top of buffers on top of buffers. So we've got -- we feel like we're sitting on a lot of capital even sitting where we are today at 6.1% Tier 1 leverage. We certainly wouldn't want to do anything that sacrifices the long-term growth of the business. So the idea of saying, \"Let's somehow cap our growth below $700 billion,\" I wouldn't necessarily see that as a path that we want to pursue.\n We did -- as you mentioned, we did migrate those $111 billion of securities out of available for sale to held to maturity really before we saw a dramatic rise in rates. So that really has been helpful. And to the extent we were buying new securities on the margin, we would be likely to put those into held to maturity assuming it was an appropriate fit with the security. So those are all actions that certainly will continue to look at.\n And a lot of the purchasing we're doing by targeting securities with a duration or maturity less than 3 years, those don't generate much AOCI volatility. So that helps us. And some of this AOCI, of course, amortizes down over time. So again, that's all makes the point, I think -- help support, I guess, why we feel like this is a very manageable situation. Sure. So on the prepayment amortization, we saw about a [indiscernible] basis point reduction in premium amortization between Q4 and Q1. And embedded within that NIM outlook that we shared is our expectation that again assuming rates continue as they have, that we can see another similar-sized reduction between Q1 and Q2 and probably between Q1 and Q4, somewhere on the order of 10 basis points, plus or minus improvement in the premium -- the level of premium amortization.\n In terms of of loan growth, we do -- despite the rising rate environment, we do think there's a lot of opportunity for growth. Clearly, the refinancing wave has largely passed, and we're entering on the mortgage side, a new purchase -- it's more of a new purchase market. But our rates are very, very compelling. And the -- still, despite the success we've had with growing our lending solutions, there's still a lot of clients out there who don't yet turn to us for their lending needs, who would be better off turning to us for their lending needs. It's good for them and it's good for us both financially and strategically. So we still think there's a big opportunity there with both the Schwab clients as well as now with the legacy Ameritrade clients to increase the awareness of the Schwab Bank capabilities, pricing, et cetera.\n And then with pledged asset line, Rick referenced the improvement in cycle times. That's -- I think that continues to be a big opportunity. We are very much underpenetrated in that product relative to other wealth management firms. And so we're working hard to again increase the awareness, improve the process there to make that more accessible to both retail clients as well as the RIA clients. The RIA clients have a lot of interest in pledged asset and so we think there's a big opportunity there. So we think there's a lot of opportunity on the lending side without a doubt. Well, thank you, Rich, for the question. I do think that's something we're likely to include when we have our July update as we get further into this cycle. As you point out, the next couple of Fed funds increases, we'll get the benefit, of course, from the increase itself plus the impact on the money fund fee waivers. Those money fund fee waivers should all be gone after the next, certainly, one or potentially 2 Fed increase. I think probably the next one, they're pretty much all gone at that point.\n The next couple after that, certainly, you've got the very quick benefit on roughly 40% to 45% of our balance sheet interest -- or our interest-earning assets that are in floating rate securities today. So that benefit kicks in relatively quickly and you can do the math in terms of that.\n The deposit betas, as you may recall from the last rising rate cycle, they started off on the lower end and then they start -- they do edge up over time after we get above sort of 100, 125 basis points. But they never -- I don't think they ever got above, I want to say, 25% or 30% even at sort of a 2% Fed fund or 2.5% -- 2.25%, 2.5% Fed funds rate. So that the incremental benefit of the eighth Fed -- 25 basis points Fed increase is slightly less than the benefit of the seventh, but there's still certainly significant upside as you start to stack some of these Fed funds increases on top of each other. Well, we use that -- we mentioned that, Rich, as a reference point, not as a prediction -- there are a number of different dynamics this time, this go around, right? We're not going through the bulk transfer. We're not executing the bulk transfers as we did last time when those bulk transfers were a catalyst for some clients to take action with regard to their cash.\n We have the Ameritrade clients now in their accounts, which tend to be smaller and more trading-oriented. So -- and they didn't have access to necessarily -- or certainly to the same access to purchase money funds in the last rising rate cycle. So we don't necessarily have great information in terms of how they'll behave. We have a lot of new accounts that we picked up in the last 1.5 years that oftentimes are smaller and more trading-oriented, so how they behave as well.\n And so given all of that, we feel like it's appropriate to make sure we are planning for different scenarios in terms of how this could unfold and then maintaining -- and that's really the key word is maintaining that flexibility so that we don't box ourselves in and we can respond under depending on how things evolve. So let me take the second question first. Hard to say. We certainly have the option to take additional balances over the course of the year. At this point, I'm not sure I would expect a lot more additional migrations out of the BDA or the IDA onto our balance sheet in 2022.\n In terms of the upside on the BDA or IDA, you're absolutely right, it is very much there. About 20% of those balances are in floating rate and those are tied to the Fed funds rate. So as the Fed increases, you get the upside on 20% of $140-something billion pretty quickly. And we are executing new fixed investments about 90 basis points higher than the roll-off rate on those fixed maturities or those tenors that are maturing over the next 12 months. So a lot of upside in terms of the fixed portion of the IDA as well. Yes. That's a really interesting question. So our securities lending operation tends to focus more on the hard-to-borrow stocks. And so we're lending out stocks that oftentimes have a 99% rate -- annualized rate. So certainly very -- these are very high-spread securities, very much in demand that can generate a lot of -- certainly a lot of revenue.\n And the -- and so when you look over time, the interest in those hard-to-borrow stocks tends to correlate with the sentiment in the market. And so -- and the availability as well of those hard-to-borrow stocks varies with the sentiment in the market. In other words, when our clients have higher-margin balances that tends to correlate to an extent with more securities lending revenue.\n Now in a higher rate environment -- so for those of you who don't know as much about securities lending, when we lend out the stock, we do get cash as collateral from the counterparty. We have to lock up that cash in the reserve portfolio and it earns what the reserve portfolio earns. In a higher rate environment, of course, the cash that we receive, we can earn a higher yield on that cash.\n Oftentimes, though, that does when the counterparties are thinking about the rebate rates, they do factor that into the rebate that they're willing to give us. So in other words, if you have a stock that might be -- they might be willing to pay, let's say, 10% per year for in an environment where the cash that we're receiving doesn't earn much. If we're earning 2% on that cash, maybe they'll be willing to pay 8% in rebate.\n And so if you're looking forward, if you're looking at the reported securities lending revenue, you might see the direct securities lending revenue being lower, but it's being made up for by earning more on the cash, which sits in another place on the income statement. Sure. So I mean there's a number of different -- certainly a number of different dynamics at play there. So then again, the next couple of rate hikes, the $54 million of money fund fee waivers, we'd expect those to be completely eliminated by -- assuming the Fed follows through, be completely eliminated by the end of the second quarter. So going into the third quarter, we've got the full fees that we're capturing there.\n We have, I think, most recently -- look, I think we've got 43% of the interest-earning assets are in floating rate securities. Those tend to reprice very, very quickly. And so you take 43% times $600-plus billion interest-earning assets and you get that benefit on that very quickly with each Fed increase.\n The other -- to the extent that we're -- the rates are continuing to follow the forward curve and continue to climb, then that gives us more opportunity as we are doing -- executing new purchases to be picking up yield. That will play out over time given the duration of our investment portfolio. We do get that paydown activity and those maturities on that investment portfolio and that creates new field to be able to reinvest at those higher rates. And then as I had mentioned, with the IDA, you've got the 20% in floating roughly. That reprices relatively quickly -- or very quickly.\n And then we have the roll-on versus roll-off rate in the IDA. We're picking up that 90 basis points. Again, that's more of a function of long-term rates. But certainly, with those being where they are today, that creates certainly some nice wind in our backs on the IDAs as well. Sure. So let's see. Let me again take the second part of the question first. Executing on the transfers on the IDAs, as I mentioned, I wouldn't expect that we're going to do -- we already took the $12 billion, $13 billion thus far this year. And I wouldn't expect us to do a lot more on the IDA migrations this year. We'll have to see you kind of where we are next year as we get into our planning and how we think about that.\n In terms of investing in new cash flows, that is absolutely part of our consideration as we see those cash flows come in. We do make a decision. But it's part of the overall mosaic, if you will, around how we think about our investment strategy. It's not like we think about new cash differently than we do with the cash that's generated from paydowns and maturities and so forth. We're looking at doing multiple forecasts over several years to sort of think about how conditions could evolve over time and making sure we are adjusting our asset duration, maturity schedule, liquidity positioning to be able to respond to a range of possible scenarios for that. All right. Well, that brings us to the top of the hour. I just -- I want to thank you all for your questions. Walt used the word consistency in his opening remarks, and I think that's a very apt word to describe our business strategy as well as our ALM and investing strategy. I'd also use the word humility in it, humility to understand. There's a lot happening right now in the environment that we don't necessarily -- we can't completely predict. We can't necessarily completely predict what investor sentiment is going to do, what the Fed is going to do, what's going to happen with interest rates. And so given that humility, we also want to make sure we maintain a lot of flexibility. That is the overarching word, I guess, or the sentiment that characterizes our investing strategy and how we're positioning the company, the balance sheet, et cetera, moving forward. But we're very excited, very confident for what the future will bring both financially and strategically and we look forward to giving you another update in July. Thanks, everyone."

            "content": "Thank you, Walt, and hello, everyone. I'm thrilled to be here today to share an update on the progress we have made this year to advance our key strategic initiatives. Walt talked about consistency. Our actions continue to be guided by our Through Clients' Eyes strategy. With that as our North Star, we're focused on the 3 actions that you see on this page: achieving even more scale and efficiency, pursuing win-win monetization and meeting the segmented needs of our clients. In this quarter, we've made progress on all fronts, and I'd like to start by sharing some of the updates on scale and efficiency.\n In the first quarter, the key measure of our scale and efficiency, our expense on client assets, or EOCA, was 15 basis points or 13 basis points on an adjusted basis. Although that's up slightly from recent levels due to seasonal expenses and the market decline, we continue to believe that this lower cost to serve provides us with a competitive edge.\n To illustrate the power of the investments we've made in digital and technology capabilities, I think it is remarkable that we have bolstered our trading system capacity by more than 5x over the last 5 years. To put that in perspective, this means that we have the ability within a handful of minutes to handle the same system volume we would have handled in an entire day only a few years ago.\n As we think about the future for us in scale and efficiency, our top priority remains consistent: the integration of Ameritrade. And we made consistent and more progress on this front in the first quarter of this year, including duly licensing Ameritrade financial consultants. This has a number of important benefits, including making client day 1 easier and providing the opportunity to introduce our wealth management capabilities and improving retention and win-win monetization.\n Speaking of win-win monetization, I spoke in January about 3 areas where we see the opportunity to help more clients and to drive growth, and those areas are asset management wealth management and lending. I'm going to focus my comments today on 2 of those areas, asset management and lending.\n On the proprietary asset management side, I am thrilled to share that last week, we launched Schwab Personalized Indexing. Our proprietary launch provides tax benefits to investors. It brings the minimum on our platform for direct indexing down to $100,000 from the $250,000 level that it was at for the third-party product that has been on our platform. Yet that $100,000 minimum is still at a level where we think meaningful tax benefits can be provided to clients.\n And finally, we launched at 40 basis points for retail clients and 25 basis points for advisers, which are very competitive fee points. You can expect us to continually innovate in this area, and stay tuned for more updates as it relates to personalization and a digital experience within our personalized indexing offer.\n In February, we launched our new strategic relationship with T. Rowe Price. This launch has a number of client benefits, including providing RIAs with no transaction fee access to T. Rowe's -- T. Rowe Price's lowest-cost institutional share class funds.\n Turning now to lending. I've talked previously about the potential upside to enhancing our lending offer for both IS and AS clients. Most importantly, I think this would be a win for clients. Clients are asking to do their bond through Schwab, and we know they can access our industry-leading low rates here.\n We've made a lot of progress on this front this year. We've cut our pledged asset line. Our PAL cycle time is down significantly. We've created a new lending experience for our ultra-high net worth clients. And we've worked with Rocket Mortgage to make it easier for our $5 million-plus clients to get a mortgage. All of this has resulted in our Client Promoter Scores for lending being at 77 in the first quarter, which is near all-time highs, suggesting clients are seeing the value from this offer.\n Let me wrap up with sharing a bit more on our efforts to meet the specific needs of our client segments. As I mentioned earlier, seeing Through Clients' Eyes is our North Star, and we made progress this quarter to meet the needs and preferences of a range of investors, and I want to share an update on that.\n For trading-oriented and newer clients, we launched Thematic Stock List in March. This is an innovative new tool that will help trading-oriented and newer clients identify themes that may be of interest to them and help them identify investment and trading opportunities. We have over 45 themes available for clients today, including a number of ESG-related themes. You can expect from us additional advancements as it relates to this capability and the way we deliver to clients over time.\n Turning now to our high net worth client segment. This client segment grew at 5x the rate of retail households year-over-year. And we continue to enhance our advice, our service and our offers like lending to make sure that they meet the specific needs of our high net worth clients.\n More broadly, we've continued to make progress to build out our relationship support model. We've added financial consultants, wealth strategists and other professionals to make sure that investors at Charles Schwab feels supported. For our trader clients, we've established the first-ever Ameritrade Active Trader FC branch. For our ESG investors, we've recently launched MSCI ESG ratings on individual stocks that our clients can use to evaluate the investment decisions they're making alongside other criteria that they like to look at. This new resource on ESG adds to other enhancements that we've made in the past year for ESG investors, including the launch of the Schwab Ariel ESG ETF, the Wasmer Schroeder positive impact strategy launched last year, ESG-related themes that can be found in the Thematic Stock List, and access to an ESG index as part of our recent Schwab Personalized Indexing launch.\n And finally, we also have an RIA client segmentation strategy. Our AS model is designed to serve clients of all sizes, from clients just starting their businesses to large multifamily offices and everywhere in between. Late last year, we segmented our client base into 3 subsegments to tailor support to the needs and priorities of our different advisers. Early results show this specialization or segmentation has been immensely successful with client satisfaction up and improved service.\n As we look ahead, you will continue to see the consistency of our strategy. With Through Clients' Eyes as our North Star, we will continue to put our clients first as we make progress on these important initiatives.\n And with that, I will turn it back to Walt. Thanks for the question. I'd say 2 things. First, we have a tremendous amount of resources available for clients today in the alternative space on both adviser services and investor services. We are working -- so that's number -- point number one. Point number two, there is growing in greater demand for alternatives. And we know that there are some enhancements we can make particularly on the retail side. And so you can expect to see from us in coming periods more development on that front.\n We have a nice range of alternative-related options available for retail clients today, but we also believe we can go to the next level in terms of the types of vehicles and strategies that our investor services clients can access. So you can expect more development from us on that front what we think is already a strong base of appealing options that both our adviser clients and investor services clients can take advantage of today."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Unknown Executive",
            "content": "Absolutely. I'll share a few thoughts on that. First, one of the things that's exciting to us about this launch is that it's an advice product that appeals to a broad range of investor types, including those self-directed clients at Schwab, who maybe haven't previously been interested in advice here at Schwab. So we're excited about the fact that it opens up -- opens us up to a broader set of clients that may be interested in it.\n In terms of thinking through the scale and how it may grow, there's, I think, around $14 trillion that sits in active mutual funds today. I believe last quarter, something like $140 billion came out of active mutual funds, and ETFs grew by about $200 billion. So there's a lot of money sitting there that may be interested in something like this.\n And I think there's 2 primary reasons why some of that money may move over time. One clearly is taxes. I think if you go back and study this, there can be somewhere around a 2% return improvement through harvesting taxes. And so for the taxable investor, the opportunity to participate in that return stream and pay a 40 basis point fee looks like an attractive option relative to even a low-cost ETF and perhaps against some active strategies. So I do think there will be some appeal to mutual fund and ETF investors.\n But I also believe that this is a product that if you walk down the street and ask someone, \"Hey, do you want a direct indexing or when people come into our offices?\" they've never heard of the product before by and large. And so one of the real powers I think that Schwab brings to the table as it relates to personalized indexing is I think success is going to take 3 things: one, it's going to take strong indexing skills; two, it's going to take digital capabilities; and importantly, number three, it's going to take distribution. Because in the near term, this product is going to have to be sold. It's going to have to be explained. The benefits are going to have to be shared with clients as to why that's helpful. And so I really think we're in a unique position, and we're excited for the growth.\n I do think next 5 or 10 years, as Walt has put it before, I think a freight train of money will move into this area and I believe we're perfectly positioned to play a big role. Peter, a question from the web console from Daniel Fannon at Jefferies. I know you mentioned that you'd be revisiting a, we'll say, a more formal update to the scenario later in the year as things continue to unfold. But maybe you could spend a little bit of time talking about some of the potential upside that we might see or that could be available due to additional rate hikes if they were to manifest."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Walter Bettinger",
            "content": "Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning. Consistency, it's a word that I spend a lot of time on, and it's a word that is critical at Schwab. It means that we're committed to a consistent business strategy, a consistent commitment to feeding the virtuous cycle of innovating on behalf of investors, a consistent financial reporting cadence, a consistent commitment to our employees and the communities that we live and work in and a consistent long-term approach. It's focused not just on the current year but on years to come.\n But when I talk about consistency, I also want to emphasize that it doesn't mean that we have to be slow or stodgy or unwilling to be disruptive. Frankly, I don't think I've ever heard anyone refer to Schwab as unwilling to be disruptive. But it does mean that clients can count on us through good times for investing as we enjoyed much of last year as well as more difficult times. It means that they know we work hard to improve on our shortcomings and that we will continue to innovate, enhance and keep their best interest at the forefront of our firm.\n I think as all of you know who have followed our company, taking a long-term client-centric approach, it's not always easy. But after almost 14 years as CEO, I'm as committed as ever to my belief that it is really the only path to rewarding long-term stockholders. And in the first quarter of this year, we executed on that exact approach despite it being a tough quarter for investors.\n And clients continue to reward us with their business, over 1 million new brokerage accounts, over $120 billion in net new assets. We're just going to continue investing to better serve them and innovate on their behalf. Importantly, we're also going to remain consistent in our strategic approach, Through Clients' Eyes, and that is our North Star.\n So let's take a look at some of the details from the first quarter and the implications for our long-term emphasis. It was, I guess, you could say a fairly brutal quarter for investors, whether they were conservative, aggressive or anywhere in between. So we had 4 decade-high inflation, and the resulting anticipated increase in interest rates really punished fixed income investors. And of course, the equity market declined rather sharply before we saw a modest comeback a bit late in that first quarter.\n But despite it being a difficult quarter, again, clients continued to trust us. They continued to bring their hard-earned investment dollars to Schwab and opened new accounts with us. We maintained an organic growth rate in terms of core net new assets at the same consistent level we've been able to deliver for over a decade. We've done that in good times. We've done it in more difficult times. And of course, we've done it even as we've grown larger, had a much larger base, and therefore, presumably more challenging.\n Taking a look at the next slide, investor sentiment felt pretty hard during the quarter. It turned quite a bit negative, then we had a small recovery in the market late again in the quarter, created a little bit of a lift off the floor from where we were in sentiment. But we saw the sentiment manifest itself throughout the quarter, things like margin loan balances falling about $6 billion from year-end. And although trading activity was relatively robust overall, I think as Peter is going to discuss in his section, the mix of those trades changed and reflected much more of what we might consider a risk-off viewpoint by investors.\n But again, with our commitment to consistency, it means we're -- we don't slam on the gas or slam on the brakes depending on environmental factors that are going on around us. Instead, we're -- our strategic efforts are designed to enhance services to clients for years to come, deliver financial benefits to stockholders over the years. So as you would expect, we will continue making investments for the long term consistent with the 3 key strategic initiatives that we've shared with you multiple times.\n And Rick, maybe I can turn it over to you, and you can spend a bit of time discussing some of those efforts. Thanks, Rick. It's a wonderful summary of several of the efforts going on across the firm to better serve our clients and build stockholder value over time.\n Someone asked me in a meeting Tuesday morning, they said, \"Walt, what are you going to do about the decline in SCHW that happened on Monday?\" And it probably shouldn't surprise any of you what my answer was. I said, \"It's pretty simple. We're going to keep focusing on our clients and our prospects. We're going to keep executing on the virtuous cycle. We're only scratching the surface of the available domestic market with about 12% penetration.\"\n And when we do those things well, I'm confident in our future prospects. We never panic. We never try to pull rabbits out of the hat. We're never going to try and make short-term results by deviating from an approach that has worked for 50 years.\n So just to wrap things up in my segment, yes, it's a tough environment for investors. But our all-weather financial model performed quite strongly during a period of market turbulence. And when I look out through the course of 2022, I am very optimistic about our earnings potential. More on that will come from Peter.\n But no matter how the year unfolds, you can count on the fact that we will remain consistent in the areas that matter most: a strategy based on seeing the world Through Clients' Eyes, a set of competitive advantages that we continue to enhance, a commitment to the virtuous cycle that continually rewards our clients, our employees and our long-term stockholders. We'll keep making progress on our key strategic initiatives that Rick referenced, and we'll keep making progress on the integration of TD Ameritrade. And we'll do it all in a consistent manner with a winning strategy, Through Clients' Eyes.\n So Peter, I know a lot of folks are anxious to hear from you. So let me turn it over to you for a look at our financials."

This is Jeff Edwards, Head of Investor Relations, and I hope everyone is still on track for their respective resolutions. While it is the New Year, we are joined by the same Venable panel of presenters, our Co-Chairman and CEO, Walt Bettinger; President, Rick Wurster, and CFO, Peter Crawford. Obviously, a bit of a different structure to Winter Business Update this time around to be 100% virtual, but you'll still get the same in-depth perspectives from the team regarding client trends and behavior, continued progress on strategic initiatives, and the tremendous opportunity we see on the horizon. Before diving in, let's quickly review the rules of the road for today. Q&A remains one question, no follow-up, though we certainly encourage you to jump back into the queue if additional questions come to mind. As always, please don't hesitate to contact the Schwab IR team to work through any clarifying or some of your more tactical questions. And the slides for today's update will be posted to the IR website following peers' remarks. And certainly, last but not least, the forward-looking statements page reminding us all that the future is uncertain, so please stay up-to-date with our disclosures. And with that, Walt.\nWalt Bettinger: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our January Business Update. We're here in Frigid Westlake, Texas, where I think it was 15 degrees when I hopped in the vehicle this morning to come to the office. But Happy New Year and again, thank you all for joining us. So as we close the book on 2023 and begin thinking about 2024, it seems like a natural time to reflect on the year that just closed. It was certainly a challenging year for our clients, for our stockholders, and for us. Perhaps it was the most challenging in my time at Schwab, certainly the most challenging since the bursting of the Internet bubble in 2000. And yet at the same time, I couldn't be more excited about the opportunities before us. In 2024, you're going to see an emphasis on execution, but with consistency around our strong client fundamentals and strategy. I recognize that 2024 is going to be a transition year from a financial standpoint, albeit one with steadily improving financial results throughout the year and a very strong exit into 2025. It's unrealistic to think that the challenges of 2023 simply disappear, because the calendar flips over. But when I look ahead to 2025, 2026, and 2027, I'm quite confident that the power of our client franchise is going to shine in terms of financial results. There's much work to do in 2024 and beyond, and no one at Schwab is kidding themselves that everything is perfect right now. But my confidence is high. I'm incredibly encouraged by what I see, whether it's our positioning, our client relationships, the solutions that we offer our clients, or the focus of the entire organization on the future. If I could take you back in time to the mid-2000s, that was a period when Chuck first began speaking with me about the possibility of becoming CEO someday. And as a result of those discussions, I went on a listening tour of former very Senior Executives of Schwab. My goal is simply to ask them their views on the firm and our prospects for the future. It's important to keep in mind that many of them had been let go or terminated in the turmoil that followed the Internet bubble bursting. They had experienced this incredible run-up in the value of the firm, followed by the pain of multiple rounds of employee layoffs and a stock price that had collapsed from the \u201850s to mere single digits. And although each of them used different words, they all basically said the same thing they were fearful that Schwab Best Days were in the past. I tried to absorb their counsel and their feedback objectively, of course, I was balancing the personal challenges that they had each been through as I listen to their feedback. But I fundamentally did not believe that the firm's best days were in the past. There were far too many strengths for me to believe that. And over a few years, with a lot of hard work by many people, I believe it's pretty clear that we proved them wrong. As our stock price grew over ten-fold and assets, the clients entrusted us with grew similarly. I understand that today there are some who might be asking similar questions, but I am confident that our Best Days are ahead of us. In my opinion, after four decades in this business, there is no firm better positioned for the future. No firm has our breadth of client solutions, investing, trading, custody, advisory workplace. And all delivered with an incredible value for investors and advisors. I expect us to make steady progress in both client flows and financial performance throughout this upcoming year, and then I fully expect us to deliver outstanding results over the following years. So let's go ahead and dig in to 2023. It was a year of many twists and turns for our investor clients as well as for our stockholders. And all the while we made substantial progress on the largest acquisition related conversion in the history of our industry. Coming on off a difficult 2022 for investors, the first quarter of 2023 began with turmoil in the regional banking world. Investor sentiment bounced between negative and positive throughout the year before eventually ending quite positive. Equity returns were strong in 2023, although largely concentrated in a modest number of stocks. For Schwab stockholders, it was a difficult year. Our stock lost about 17% of its value. The core reasoning behind most of this decline is our commitment to proactively following our through-client size strategy. Because throughout 2022 and 2023, we reached out to our clients and encouraged them to move their yield-sensitive, or what we sometimes refer to as longer-term investment cash, into higher-yielding alternatives. And they did, to the tune of several $100 billion. And an and aside although these actions have temporally impacted our revenue and earnings, we would do the same thing every time. The client loyalty that we build by being proactive will pay dividends in the long-term as clients continue to entrust us with their investment dollars. Progress on the Ameritrade conversion was exceptional with about 90% of the client accounts and assets all accurately and successfully converted. And despite the substantial focus on this effort, we continue to make real progress on other client-related initiatives that help set the table for future organic growth. Let's go ahead on this slide and take a deeper look into 2023 from the lens of our investor clients. The open market committee of the federal reserve continued to recover from the mistaken transitory inflation viewpoint they raised rates multiple times in 2023 before peaking at close to 5.5%, as inflation began to ease directionally toward the Fed's long-term goal of 2%. And although equity markets continue to be volatile, ultimate returns were actually quite strong, with the S&P 500 rising over 20% and the NASDAQ composites increasing over 40%. Investor sentiment was also volatile throughout 2023. It recovered rather dramatically in the fourth quarter of the year from a strong bear sentiment in the third quarter and ended the year with a solid bullish viewpoint. But despite this mixed sentiment, our clients remained highly engaged with the markets and with Schwab. Clients were net purchasers of equities last year by a 1.2 to 1 ratio, and although trading activity was about 10% lower than in 2022, it was still much higher than pre-pandemic levels. And net flows into our retail advisory solutions were a very strong $33 billion. Last year was a solid year in terms of client flows for our firm, particularly given the volatility of the markets and the negative sentiment that existed throughout much of the year. Core net new assets were slightly above $300 billion, and core net new assets from clients who originally opened their accounts with Schwab were about $30 billion higher. The difference, of course, reflecting the attrition from certain former Ameritrade clients. Now in terms of the Ameritrade conversion, we've converted approximately 90% of the accounts and assets, that totals about $1.6 trillion in assets and 15 million accounts. And we'll convert the balance in May of this year. There's no question that this conversion has been a success. Attrition continues to track below the estimates that we shared in 2019 when the transaction was announced. Of course, we hate losing any clients, but we're realistic that some attrition is to be expected, and also knowing that we would be proactively stepping away from serving certain former Ameritrade clients for a variety of logical reasons. Stepping back a bit to look at the bigger picture, we are committed to our through client-side strategy, and it underlines our no tradeoffs execution. We believe the backbone of organic growth is delivered by focusing on four areas: value, service, transparency, and trust with both our clients, as well as our prospects. Now the ultimate measure of value for clients is the balance between the quality of service and guidance they receive and the revenue we earn that pays for this service and guidance. And we don't believe any investment services firm delivers a better value than Schwab. The quality of our service is well recognized, and I'm going to go ahead and speak on that a little bit more momentarily. And the revenue we earn averages less than one quarter of 1%. In fact, we've almost halved what clients pay us in one form or another over the past 20-years. When you compare that to what investors pay certain wirehouses or independent broker dealers or regionals, Schwab clients paid between approximately half or even in some cases close to a quarter of what they pay these other firms. Now that difference adds up to an enormous drag on client wealth creation over the years. It's one of the key structural advantages that clients of Charles Schwab benefit from. And we've been recognized for many years as a leader in client service in the financial services world. And despite the complexities inherent in the Ameritrade conversion, we retained our world-class results in 2023 for client service. Our net promoter score in our retail business remained in the mid-60s, while our overall speed to answer phone calls was about 30 seconds, with retail averaging just below 20 seconds last year. Now these metrics are very important as our reputation for service and creating client loyalty extends across all of our client-facing businesses. Delivering world-class service is a never-ending area of emphasis, requires training, investment in digital and self-service capabilities, as well as a philosophical deep belief in the nobility of service. Service has always been at the core of our success at Schwab and will always remain so. Transparency is also a hallmark of Schwab, whether it be defined as our open architecture approach to investing, the clarity of any fees or charges assessed to our clients, or the fact that we've been a leader in both guaranteeing the security of our clients' assets, as well as their overall satisfaction. Our satisfaction guarantee is unique across the industry. It's provided our clients with the confidence they deserve as they make investment decisions. And although the payments we've historically made under this satisfaction guarantee are relatively modest, we believe deeply in the philosophy of guaranteeing our clients delight with our services and guidance. We often say at Schwab that we are less in the investment business than we are in the trust business. And this was never more true than in 2023. As clients wanted to access their client cash that we held at our banks, we ensured they had ample liquidity to move that cash into money market funds, bonds, treasuries or other investments. And while this happened more quickly than we would have expected given the unparalleled pace of Fed rate moves, our contingency plans worked as designed to ensure that we could always be there to support our clients. As a result, during a period of heightened concern about bank stability across the industry last spring, our clients were able to have confidence in Schwab. We're honored that both JD Power and Investor's Business Daily gave our firm and our bank the highest scores in the areas of investor satisfaction and trust, respectively, last year. And we're committed to maintaining and building trust with our clients in the years to come. Before I turn it over to Rick, I want to take a moment to remind everyone that our strategies, our philosophies, and our execution at Schwab are not random. We evaluate everything we do by screening it through a series of lens that apply our experience and knowledge about the investing industry, both today as well as where it's headed in the future. We categorize these viewpoints into three buckets and they may look familiar to those of you who've dialed into our calls in the past. Broad trends, client views, and the competitive landscape. If I were to highlight the viewpoints on these three buckets, it would be: first, we are ideally positioned to benefit from growth in the areas of the industry that have grown the fastest in recent years and project the most organic growth potential for the future. Self-directed investors and traders, RIAs serving as a fiduciary to their clients, and low-cost, tax-aware investing. Next, clients are looking for firms that offer a breadth of solutions that are personalized for them and make sense within the context of a financial plan. Ideally, firms should be able to assist clients with both sides of their balance sheet, investing and borrowing. We believe the future will be won by firms that find the right balance between offering digital and mobile efficiency on par with non-financial services experience and of course paired with access to well-trained and credentialed professionals. Not surprising, given our viewpoints, we believe Schwab is optimally positioned for long-term organic growth. Rick, let me turn it over to you.\nRick Wurster: Thank you, Walt, and Good morning, everyone. Schwab is in a position of strength to deliver on the client expectations that Walt just spoke about. I'll spend our time together this morning talking about how we delivered for clients in 2023 within the strategic focus areas that you see on this page. I'll also share more about the investments we're making to continue building on our strong foundation, so we can do even more to help our current and future clients meet their financial goals, which in turn will bolster our organic growth and our competitive positioning. I'll start with scale and efficiency. Our number one priority in 2023 was to execute the largest integration in the history of the industry. And it has been a tremendous success. As Walt highlighted, we brought about 90% of Ameritrade clients to Schwab, representing $1.6 trillion in converted assets, 7,000 RIA firms, and 15 million total converted accounts. While clients are getting used to navigating a new experience and a different way of doing things, they are also seeing the breadth of capabilities on our combined platform. We also focused in 2023 on reducing expenses. We captured approximately $500 million in annual run rate expense savings through streamlining our operating model, which included position eliminations from predominantly non-client facing areas, as well as reducing our real estate footprint. The remaining $400 million in Ameritrade expense synergies will be realized in the second-half of 2024 following the completion of the integration. When we think about win-win monetization, we think about meeting more of our clients\u2019 total financial needs, including more holistic solutions, lending capabilities, and access to high-quality, fairly priced products. This attracts and retains client assets and at the same time improves our economics. We generated strong results in our advice business with a 29% year-over-year increase in net advised flows, including $12 billion in net flows into our proprietary full-service wealth management solution, Schwab Wealth Advisory. This is a record for our firm. Wasmer Schroeder net flows were $6.7 billion, a record for the offer and a 90% increase over the prior year. And when it comes to direct indexing, we've enhanced our Schwab personalized indexing offer with expanded customization capabilities, a new account level digital dashboard, and digital enrollment. We launched our fully digital Pledged Asset Line, or PAL, for RIA clients that gives advisors the ability to submit a PAL application in minutes, and clients can get approved in hours for straightforward applications and in just days for complex situations. We also launched Schwab Investing Themes, which allows self-directed investors to buy and sell themes of securities that align with their personal interests and values, all available through schwab.com as well as our mobile app. Finally, our goal in the third focus area is to see through clients' eyes to meet the unique needs of each of our clients' segments. Highlights from the last year include introducing our specialized asset-based segments for retail high net worth and ultra-high net worth clients, which we call Schwab Private Client Services and Schwab Private Wealth Services. These tailored offers meet the unique needs of these clients who represent about 70% of our retail assets. Schwab Private Client Services includes access to a financial consultant, dedicated service, expanded access to specialists, as well as products and fee discounts. Schwab Private Wealth Service delivers all that plus prioritized service, enhanced support, expedited requests, priority access to wealth specialists and exclusive events, pricing benefits, American Express Statement Credit, bank benefits, and more. We also in 2023 launched Schwab Trading powered by Ameritrade, a reimagined trading experience made possible by the combination of the best of Schwab and Ameritrade. All clients can now access the thinkorswim trading platform, giving them access to a unique combination of powerful tools and dedicated service from experienced trading professionals alongside education for all levels of experience. We also in 2023 enhanced our offer for all RIA clients. All clients can now access thinkpipes, our thinkpipes trading platform, which offers real-time charting, pre and post-trade allocations, and complex options functionality. In addition, we launched Ameritrade's iRebal and Model Market Center on Schwab Advisor Center, and are taking a measured approach to ensure a seamless onboarding experience for new iRebal users, with general access rolling out early this year. Finally, we acquired the family wealth alliance to expand our capabilities to serve both single-family and multi-family offices. As we look ahead in 2024, we will continue to focus on and make investments in our key strategic focus areas to drive our organic growth, fuel our virtuous cycle, and help clients achieve their financial goals. One thing I'll point out about this page is that given our focus on continuing to make Schwab an easy place to do business, we are adding a fourth pillar to our strategic focus areas called EASE, which is about delivering exceptional and easy experiences to our clients. With 35 million client accounts, serving our clients exceptionally well will be a big driver of our organic growth. When we think about scale and efficiency, we're laser focused on successfully converting the final Ameritrade client transition group and then capturing our remaining expense synergies. We'll continue making investments in artificial intelligence to empower our teams to serve clients even more effectively. And finally, we will invest in automation and systems modernization over the next several years, allowing us to drive greater efficiency. Win-win monetization remains an important opportunity where we can both delight clients and boost our revenue. Looking ahead, we'll continue to make investments to enable clients to keep more of their financial life with us, including a continued focus on lending capabilities that meets the needs of more clients across both IS and AS. We'll enhance our wealth and advice offerings, including making continued investments in Schwab Wealth Advisory. We'll continue to build on our momentum with personalized investing solutions, and we'll continue to broaden the breadth and depth of product offerings with new offers like alternative investments. And we continue to do work to integrate the workplace experience more into Schwab, allowing our workplace clients to benefit from all we have to offer at Schwab. Within client segmentation, we'll remain focused on meeting the unique needs of our client segments, including our higher net worth clients, traders, and RIAs. Part of this is providing differentiated client experiences, just as we've done this year with the new retail high net worth and ultra-high net worth offers that I spoke to earlier. This also means enhanced service models, specialized capabilities, our powerful trading platform, and our tailored education. Our fourth focus area is Ease. With the size of our asset base, we can drive growth by simply delivering easy and exceptional experiences to our existing clients. This is where you'll see us continue to invest to make Schwab the easiest place in the industry to do business. And it's important to remember something Walt highlighted earlier. Our client's frame of reference for Ease is not just other financial services firms, it's the experiences they have on Amazon or Uber or DoorDash, and that's the measure of ease we are striving to accomplish. We want every experience a client has with us to be an exceptional one. That means we'll continue to make enhancements on all of our channels. We'll continue to digitize client workflows and to make sure our clients have access when and where they want it, whether that's on schwab.com or the mobile app, or when they call or chat with our service teams or walk into a branch. We believe that the combination of these efforts will help power our long-term organic growth. Guided by our seeing through client-size strategy, we are well positioned to retain our clients and to win new ones, fueling our organic NNA growth over the long-term. I've spoken about Schwab's unique strengths in this forum in the past. We have a top one or two position in the two fastest growing segments of financial services. Our strengths will help us attract assets from our existing clients, including our younger client base, valuable dedicated relationships, strong RIA growth, and our emphasis on ease. We'll attract new clients for the combination of the strength of our brand, our proven retail acquisition model, and our continued commitment to serving RIAs. And with the four strategic focus areas I just talked through, we'll be able to meet evolving client needs while making it easier for clients to keep more of their financial lives with us, helping us attract NNA over the long-term. Schwab's future is bright, and before I turn it over to Peter, I'd like to spend just a couple more minutes talking about some of the exciting opportunities ahead. One of our biggest opportunities is to fully harness the powerful combination of Schwab and Ameritrade. While it is still relatively early days, when we look at our Ameritrade clients, we know they are already benefiting from the breadth of Schwab's capabilities, including both lending and wealth. 95% of former Ameritrade FCs have helped the client find a solution to their needs by enrolling them in a Schwab wealth solution. And former Ameritrade FCs accounted for about 20% of our record Schwab wealth advisory net flows in 2023. Today\u2019s, former Ameritrade client advice penetration is at approximately 10%, which is above historical levels. Schwab clients are benefiting as well. We launched the new Schwab trading powered by Ameritrade experience in October, and at year-end, more than 80,000 Schwab clients had created new thinkorswim accounts. And about 20% of new to firm retail clients opted to access a thinkorswim account. The opportunity ahead for us is tremendous. We have about a 12% share of the market, and we serve the two fastest growing segments. I just spoke about our early wins and increasing Ameritrade advice penetration. As we continue to win here, we believe we have a $500 billion plus share of wallet NNA opportunity ahead of us. And we believe the win-win monetization opportunities I've spoken about represent a 3.5 billion to 4 billion wealth management and bank lending revenue opportunity. To wrap up, our through-client size strategy continues to guide us into the next chapter. We're in the final stages of the Ameritrade integration, and we've made meaningful progress across our key strategic focus areas in the last year. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to continue our healthy organic growth, and the opportunities in front of us remain highly attractive, both for Schwab and for our clients. And with that I'll turn it over to Peter.\nPeter Crawford: Well thank you very much Rick. So Walt and Rick talked about how our no trade-off positioning continues to resonate with both clients and prospects. The continued progress we're making with the Ameritrade acquisition, with the final transition group scheduled for May, our achievements and priorities around scale and efficiency, win-win monetization, segmentation, and our newer priority ease, and the large opportunity in front of us over the coming years. In my time today, I'll briefly review our 2023 financial performance, provide an update on client cash realignment, and share some thoughts on 2024. The important point is that in the fourth quarter and really over the last nine months, we continue to see notable improvement across the various tactical metrics on which there has been a lot of focus lately, including the pace of client cash reallocation activity, the level of supplemental borrowing we're utilizing, and our capital levels inclusive of AOCI. And what that means is that 2024 is likely to be somewhat of a transitional year from a financial standpoint, but with steadily improving financial results that bridge from what proved to be a challenging 2023 to what we believe is a very promising future ahead. And so while environmental factors may not allow progress to follow a strictly linear path, we believe we're moving ever closer to the point where the noise partially obscuring our long-term growth should dissipate and our relatively straightforward financial formula should begin to reassert itself once again powered by solid organic growth, our diversified business model converting that asset growth into strong revenue growth through the cycle; continued expense discipline, producing growing margins. And as our tangible capital levels continue to grow, the return of meaningful opportunistic capital return. In other words, a resumption of the proven model that you are all familiar with and that has delivered for clients and stockholders for over five decades. As Walt mentioned, 2023 was an eventful year for many of our clients and certainly a challenging one for our business model. And so not surprisingly, our financial performance was off 2022's record levels with a little under $19 billion of revenue and $3.13 of adjusted EPS. But despite those financial headwinds, we still produced an adjusted pre-tax margin of over 40%. Our fifth consecutive year doing so, which demonstrates the strength and resilience of our business model through a wide range of environments. Now turning our attention to the balance sheet. The big story last year, of course, was the roughly 30% decline in client cash on our balance sheet, of which over 80% moved in the first-half of the year. This was the outcome of clients moving some of their cash into higher-earning alternatives, as Walt mentioned, that was often with our active support and encouragement. And importantly, that money is staying at Schwab, as evidenced by the approximately $200 billion increase in purchase money funds and over $225 billion increase in fixed income in CDs our clients hold. And we supported some of that activity by utilizing temporary or supplemental borrowing, including both FHLB advances and Schwab Bank CDs. And at just under $80 billion at the end of the quarter, those have fallen by more than $17 billion from the peak level reached in May. And finally, our capital position continues to get even stronger with our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio rising to 8.5% and our adjusted Tier 1 leverage ratio, inclusive of AOCI, and therefore what our binding constraint would be if we lose the AOCI opt-out, at Schwab Bank now nearly 5.4%, meaning we are now meeting what will likely be the new quote well capitalized standard at our banks over four years ahead of the anticipated full implementation date. During last quarter's update, we talked about the slowing pace of client cash realignment over the preceding months. And in November, our clients actually added to their transactional cash balances. And then in December, we saw an approximately $15 billion increase in transactional sweep cash. Now, historically, December flows benefit from seasonal factors, but even so, when you compare December 2023 to December 2022, it is quite clear that this dynamic is receding as an important driver for us. You can also see that trend when you look at purchase money fund flows and specifically that minority of those net flows that are funded from client cash on the balance sheet. Now, as we turn our attention to 2024, our near-term financial performance will, as always, be shaped by external factors that are difficult to predict. Interest rates, equity market performance, and client trading activity. And then given the much larger sensitivity to client cash allocations, given where interest rates are today than they were, let's say three years ago, that will, of course, be a significant factor. So let's talk about this one. And given the importance of this, let's spend a bit more time here. There are really three main forces that will influence the trend of our clients' transactional cash during 2024. Any remaining client cash realignment from existing clients, the contribution of cash we attract from new clients, which I'll talk about in a moment, is the source of the greatest uncertainty moving forward, and seasonal dynamics that are generally similar every year, but can vary based on environmental conditions. We'll start with the behavior of our existing clients. And as we've discussed, we're clearly in the very late innings of the client cash realignment activity. You can see it in the monthly reporting we have shared, whether you look at total balances, balances per account, or cash as a percent of assets. And that high level trend is supported by various dynamics you see when you look under the hood. We're seeing stabilization of activity among both RIA and retail clients. Now we've talked about how cash realignment is an event, not a process. And we're seeing a decrease in both the number of those events and the average amount of the cash being realigned. Now while we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to predict the behavior of our existing clients, it's a bit harder to do so with new clients over a very short timeframe, like a year. Now, that contribution depends on the level of new clients we attract and the size of those accounts. And then how much of the net new assets comes in the form of cash and stays there, which will be influenced by investor sentiment, quantitative tightening by the Fed, inflation, savings rates, and so forth. And then you throw in that this is an election year, which normally brings an elevated degree of volatility, makes these predictions even tougher. And what this means is that while we have seen throughout our history that over time, cash balances grow with the growth in accounts and assets, over a shorter period, like a quarter or a year, it's harder to gauge exactly how much new accounts will contribute. And finally, the evolution of transactional cash over the course of 2024 is likely to be influenced by seasonal patterns, which follow a similar trajectory every year, but can vary in terms of their magnitude. That means we're seeing some cash getting invested into the markets in the first quarter. And given the large inflows we saw in December, the investment activity could be at an elevated start this year. And then we'll likely see a reduction in April as clients pay taxes before we cap the year with an anticipated buildup in December. So what does all this mean for our 2024 financial performance? Given the various moving pieces, we decided to bring back a concept you may recall we last used in 2019, which is to share with you a couple of mathematical illustrations around how our financial performance could unfold, based on what happens with certain and difficult to predict inputs. And those are trading activity. We looked at flat to 2023 levels, plus or minus 5%. And where transactional cash finishes the year relative to the 12/31 levels. Again, flat plus 5% or minus 10%. Those illustrations share a couple of common and pretty conventional assumptions. Most importantly, normal market appreciation and rates that follow the dot plots. And those illustrations could result in revenue that is plus or minus 5% there are 2023 levels or said another way, revenue that is 0% to 10% higher than our annualized Q4 2023 run rate, even with three rate cuts. We're planning, as we've shared previously, to keep adjusted expenses flat year-over-year. And that would result in an adjusted pre-tax margin of a little under 40% to somewhere in the mid-40s. Now I know it's tempting to pick the mid-point of the illustrations and interpret that as our outlook. That is not how these illustrations are intended to be used. This is just math. Using some metrics, you can track on an ongoing basis to evolve your own perspectives on our potential performance over time. And as we typically do, we have included in the appendix a set of sensitivities intended to help you make adjustments as you see fit. Now looking at the range of possibility, it doesn't apply much of any growth in terms of full year adjusted EPS. But given the consistent pay down in the higher cost supplemental borrowing, it suggests strong sequential momentum in revenue and in earnings. With a potential exit velocity heading into 2025, that is at least 20% better than where we ended 2023. And with increasing momentum as we progress through 2025 as well. Let's drill a little deeper into the expense story. Schwab has been and always will be a growth company, a company that continually invests in improving the client experience. At the same time, we're a company that recognizes that one of our biggest competitive advantages, as Walt mentioned, is our industry-leading cost structure, which is measured as EOCA. Achieving both of those requires careful balance and discipline. And in 2024, even as we're holding spending flat, we're still making significant investments that Rick talked about that will help sustain our long-term organic growth, boost our revenue, and increase our efficiency during 2024 and beyond. Our current revenue and earnings are being pressured, of course, by our utilization of the higher cost funding in the form of CDs and FHLB advances. Those are very much a temporary funding source. And as we pay off those, we continue to see a path towards a net interest margin in the 2.20% to 2.50% range by the end of this year and approaching 3% by the end of 2025 even if rates fall roughly 200 basis points from where they are today, as the dot plots would indicate, with a potential for it to expand further moving forward as we reinvest our securities portfolio at higher market rates than what we currently earn. Now while we pause our buyback in order to build our capital levels, capital return remains a very important part of our financial formula, given our very high return on capital and negligible credit exposure. Our capital levels have already reached the so-called well-capitalized threshold, even if AOCI is included. And we'd expect our consolidated adjusted Tier 1 leverage ratio to reach the upper 6% range by the end of 2024, at which point we'll be in a position to at least consider resuming opportunistic buybacks. Both Walt and I talked about 2024 being somewhat of a transitional year from a financial standpoint, but we also talked about the steady improvement we expect to see throughout the year. In some ways, I hate to use the phrase coiled spring, but I think that's exactly what is being set up as we move into 2025, as we complete the Ameritrade integration, creating a true best of breed platform and unlocking both revenue and expense synergies. We continue to advance our strategic agenda even as we maintain flat expenses. Transactional cash balances inflect and we begin to see sustained growth. And all that plus continued business momentum creates an opportunity for a return to sequential revenue growth and accelerating momentum toward the end of the year and into 2025. And that paves the way for a return to our long-term financial formula. One that is powered by our position as the premier asset gatherer, producing consistent 5% to 7% organic growth through the cycle with industry-leading client loyalty and a leadership position in the two fastest growing segments within wealth management. One that has a proven ability to expand margins through the cycle with the potential for even more dramatic margin expansion in the years ahead, back above 50% as revenue benefits from paying off higher cost borrowings and expenses benefits from harvesting the remaining expense energies. And one that can combine that strong organic growth and revenue growth with more meaningful capital return as our capital levels inclusive of AOCI march higher. And so when you take a step back and look at our potential financial performance, your perspective depends on your time frame. In the immediate term, we have been dealing with some pressures that have constrained our financial results. But those pressures are temporary, not permanent. So long-term opportunity, the long-term potential remains significant. And as an organization that has a long time horizon, that is what fuels our optimism, our confidence, and our excitement for what lies ahead. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff to facilitate our Q&A. Jeff?\nJeff Edwards: Hi, operator. Can you please remind everyone how they can ask a question and I\u2019ll turn it over to you?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question in queue is from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nKen Worthington: Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to talk about net new assets. So even when excluding the Ameritrade attrition, core net new assets seem decently lower than it had been over the last two years, despite ultimately what were better market conditions in 2023. As we sort of look at it \u201821, \u201822, core monthly [Technical Difficulty] $50 billion per month. And then the last six months, it's been, you know, $10 billion to $30 billion and there's noise there, attrition, CD's, but it's still ultimately seems like software engagement over the last six months, so the question. So first, was it 2021 and 2022 that were unusual in the aftermath of COVID or is it really the last six months that might have been unusual? Do you see a cohort or customer segment where engagement might have weakened in the second -half of 2023? And ultimately, can you give us a little bit more color on how you see the outlook for 2024?\nWalt Bettinger: Thanks, Ken. I think when you look at NNA in very short periods of time, you have to really evaluate sentiment more so than what the market did. When I spoke at the end of the third quarter last October, sentiment was very negative. And although it slipped by the end of the year, that's a late change within the year. And so when you have negative sentiment historically, when we look at longer time horizons, you're going to get lower levels of NNA. And so I think it's not what the market does. It's what the sentiment of the investor is. We don't see any reason to believe that net new assets are likely to be constrained over a longer period of time relative to historic levels. Our promoter scores, when we look at that, as they're reported on the retail side remain very, very strong. On the advisor side, we have retained virtually all of the advisors that we wanted to retain post integration. So I don't see anything on the horizon that would tell me that long-term you're going to see some form of extended softening in NNA. But short run, you have to look at sentiment and you also have to look at investment options. As rates are higher, people may bring a bit less money to their investment account as opposed to maybe leaving it at a bank where they might just be buying CDs or something of that nature. But nothing structurally gives us cause for concern.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we'll go to Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good morning. I have a question, a firefighting question, just on the NIM glide path, Peter, that you had offered. So you had previously talked about that 3% NIM, exiting \u201825. You reaffirmed the target here despite the additional cuts in the forward curves. I was hoping you could speak to some of the inputs still supporting that 3% NIM target with the rebasing and rate expectations and the NIM tailwind of $0.80 to $0.90. What is the jumping off point that we should be applying that against?\nPeter Crawford: Sure. So, the biggest driver of the growth in NIM from where we are today to 3% is continuing to pay off those supplemental borrowings. We don't necessarily need deposits to grow, although we obviously expect that will happen between now and 2025. We don't need deposits to actually grow to be able to do that. Remember, we've got probably $11 billion or $12 billion per quarter in cash flow coming from the investment portfolio. That's cash, that's earning roughly 2% today and we can use that to pay off supplemental borrowing that's costing us, lets\u2019s say,on average 5%. And so that\u2019s a significant NIM advantage and NIR [] advantage and revenue advantage that we're able to generate every month we don't \u2013 that we have even flat deposits. So that's really the biggest driver between -- for the NIM growth between now and the end of 2025 and frankly between now and the end of 2024 as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we'll go to Kyle Voigt from KBW. Please go ahead.\nKyle Voigt: Hi. Good morning. Another one for Peter. As we think about a potential Fed cutting environment, I was wondering if you could comment on how you think about deposit betas on the bank sweep on the way down? In other words, should we expect betas to mirror what we saw on the way up, but I don't think you increased bank sweep rates over the last 100 basis points in hikes or so, or given that the current cash balances that remain on your balance sheet are likely the least rate-sensitive deposits, could there be some leeway to begin to modestly move those bank sweep rates lower even with the first Fed cut?\nPeter Crawford: Yes, thanks. Thanks, Kyle, for the question. So I think it's reasonable to think that the betas could be a bit higher on the way down than they were on the way up. At 45 basis points in bank suite, we're paying a rate today that is significantly better than what traditional banks are offering on checking accounts. They're still paying, I think in many cases, 1 basis point or 2 basis points for accounts that have similar liquidity features or in some cases even inferior liquidity features. And so I wouldn't necessarily assume that the deposit betas on the way down will be symmetrical to where they were on the way up necessarily.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we'll go to Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple questions, Peter, for the path and thinking about NIM and the scenarios. Number one, I think you referenced that these scenarios are based on the dot plot, but you also referenced the forward curve. So maybe could you clarify which rate assumptions underpin the scenarios that you laid out? And also, how should we think about forecasting the interest-earning assets? You referenced $11 billion to $12 billion of principal? Is that the pace that we should be thinking about through much of 2024 until that wholesale borrowing is paid down? Thanks.\nPeter Crawford: Yes, thanks for the question. So the map out the illustrations are based on the dot plots, which again, so three cuts over the course of \u201824 and I think it's 200 basis points by the end of 2025 of easing. In terms of the pace of interest-earning assets, our priority is to pay off the supplemental borrowing. And so as we continue to prioritize that, it's reasonable to expect that our interest-earning assets would decline. Again, doing so, you can be in a situation where interest rate assets are declining, but revenue is increasing because again, we're paying off those supplemental borrowings. Of that $11 billion to $12 billion of quarterly cash flow from the investment portfolio, a portion of that is principal and then, of course, a portion of that is interest. So I wouldn't assume that the interesting assets are going down by that, necessarily by that level. But I do think it's reasonable to expect that there will be some decline as long as we have the supplemental borrowings outstanding, we're endeavoring to pay those off as quickly as possible.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we'll go to Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. Another follow-up here, Peter. Just in the context of some of the seasonality charts you gave and what we saw in the fourth quarter of FHLB declined slower in the fourth quarter versus third quarter, you had deposit trends got better. So as we think about the start of this year and clearly pace is important, how do we think about the seasonal benefits or cash trends versus those priorities of paying down the shorter-term funding?\nPeter Crawford: Yes, so we saw, you know, I think if you look at the end of the year with our -- we target in the banks kind of a 5% to 6% overnight liquidity at the banks. That position roughly doubled at the end of the year. We always like to build up extra liquidity. If you look at our prior years, we did the same thing to make sure we have a lot of excess liquidity heading into what is, again, typically the seasonal investment season. So we expect to draw down those liquidity levels. And that will help to support the seasonal activity that we're seeing. If you look at prior years, over the course of the last several years, you can kind of gauge a sense for that seasonal activity. And I would say this month is progressing kind of consistent with that. So without getting to sort of specific numbers in terms of what we're seeing month to day, I would say it's consistent with what we've seen in previous years and consistent with our expectations. But again, it's not only really clear that the seasonal activity that we see in January through March and then the tax season in April, this isn't client cash realignment. This is just activity that we see every single year as clients build up their cash balances at the end of the year and then deploy those into the markets in the first part of the year and then deploy those to the IRS, I guess, in April.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blostein: Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for the question. Just another quick follow-up on the funding dynamic. So I appreciate it might be difficult to predict client behavior with respect to transactional sweep cash on new assets, but maybe give us some color on the trends you've seen in transactional cash as a percentage of that new client assets. Call it over the last maybe six months or so just to help us kind of with the starting point, because obviously that's a really important dynamic when it comes to rebuilding the cash balances and deposits?\nWalt Bettinger: Yes, so that, I mean that's why we call that out as I would say an area of uncertainty going forward is because we are seeing, not surprisingly, we're seeing clients who are coming in are realigning their cash as existing clients are. And so that's happening, there's a certain amount of float, if you will, that we typically rely on. That is contributed a little bit less over the previous six months as clients are realigning their cash more quickly maybe than traditionally they would have done. And as rates come down, one would expect that that activity would be a little bit less immediate or timely or to the same extent. And so I think that is one of the uncertainties. What happens with the level of new cash that comes in as the Fed cuts rates 3 times, 4 times, 6 times, whatever it might be. That's why we call that out as an area of uncertainty. But we certainly still expect, as we've seen throughout history, that over time, as we add accounts, as we add assets, again over a longer arc of history, that those transactional cash balances grow with the growth in accounts and the growth in assets. It's just over a short period of time, like a quarter over a year, it's a little bit harder to gauge exactly what the near-term contribution will be. But again, over time, over three years, five years, et cetera, we expect that our total transactional cash balances will grow as we grow our client base.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final\u2026\nJeff Edwards: Thanks, operator. I think we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Absolutely. Our last question comes from Devin Ryan from JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nDevin Ryan: Thanks so much. Good morning. It gets to a different topic than some of the other questions, but probably for Rick, since you mentioned in your remarks, so obviously the firm has a strong technology background, so I'd love to just talk a little bit more detail about the opportunity you guys see from artificial intelligence investment as we look beyond 2024. So maybe looking out the next three to five years, what are some of the areas you're most focused on? How much efficiency do you think could be derived from the current use cases you see? How much productivity uplift? And just more generally, how material AI will be for Schwab? Because it would seem like this fits right into the ethos of the company long-term, but I know sometimes things take a while to kind of implement. So just love to hear a little bit more about this strategy there? Thanks.\nRick Wurster: Devin, thanks for the question on AI. I think it will have a meaningful impact in three areas on our employees, on our efficiency, and on our clients. Let me start with employees, I think AI can be used to make our employees even more effective with our clients, to provide them with the ability to have an answer that is really strong and in particular for our newer employees that are coming up to speed, the ability for AI to make them as efficient or as effective as a more experienced employee. I think will be powerful both for the employee and for our clients that are receiving the thought from that person. So I think there's a lot of benefits in helping make our employees more effective with clients. There's clearly an efficiency opportunity in AI, and here with 1,000s of phone reps that we hire each year, at some point, we likely will have the opportunity to hire less in a particular year, because we've made our reps both on the phone, on chat, in our branches even more effective and efficient, because we're powering them with information and putting it at their fingertips. And then I think there's a lot of client benefits that will come from AI. We have what I believe is the world's best trading platform in thinkorswim. And a lot of clients invest years and years into building out their platform, into building out their alerts and what types of signals they're looking at to drive what they may want to buy. And I think the opportunity for our clients to leverage an AI-driven research platform will provide them with even greater insights into how they trade, into what positions they might want to put on, into what risks they may need to be aware of. And so I think AI will directly impact clients in the future. So what I think about both making our employees as effective as possible, becoming as efficient as possible, and driving great, fine outcomes. I think AI will play an important role in all three.\nPeter Crawford: Okay. Well, thank you. Thank you, Rick. And let me just close. You know, Walt and I both said 2024 could be a bit of a transitional year. I'll be with steady progression and our financial results throughout the year. I think it's really important to put that concept in an appropriate context. You know, first is that we're talking about the top line growth versus where we finished 2023. And second and more importantly, as we emerge from this challenging period, we're not transitioning or changing our strategy, our focus on clients, the discipline with which we run the business, nor should you expect to see us lowering our organic growth aspirations or results or changing the fundamentals of our financial formula. Those have all worked quite well. And we\u2019re confident we'll continue to serve our clients and our stockholders well in the years ahead. We thank you very much and we'll look forward to speaking with you again in April.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Crawford",
            "content": "Well thank you very much Rick. So Walt and Rick talked about how our no trade-off positioning continues to resonate with both clients and prospects. The continued progress we're making with the Ameritrade acquisition, with the final transition group scheduled for May, our achievements and priorities around scale and efficiency, win-win monetization, segmentation, and our newer priority ease, and the large opportunity in front of us over the coming years. In my time today, I'll briefly review our 2023 financial performance, provide an update on client cash realignment, and share some thoughts on 2024. The important point is that in the fourth quarter and really over the last nine months, we continue to see notable improvement across the various tactical metrics on which there has been a lot of focus lately, including the pace of client cash reallocation activity, the level of supplemental borrowing we're utilizing, and our capital levels inclusive of AOCI. And what that means is that 2024 is likely to be somewhat of a transitional year from a financial standpoint, but with steadily improving financial results that bridge from what proved to be a challenging 2023 to what we believe is a very promising future ahead. And so while environmental factors may not allow progress to follow a strictly linear path, we believe we're moving ever closer to the point where the noise partially obscuring our long-term growth should dissipate and our relatively straightforward financial formula should begin to reassert itself once again powered by solid organic growth, our diversified business model converting that asset growth into strong revenue growth through the cycle; continued expense discipline, producing growing margins. And as our tangible capital levels continue to grow, the return of meaningful opportunistic capital return. In other words, a resumption of the proven model that you are all familiar with and that has delivered for clients and stockholders for over five decades. As Walt mentioned, 2023 was an eventful year for many of our clients and certainly a challenging one for our business model. And so not surprisingly, our financial performance was off 2022's record levels with a little under $19 billion of revenue and $3.13 of adjusted EPS. But despite those financial headwinds, we still produced an adjusted pre-tax margin of over 40%. Our fifth consecutive year doing so, which demonstrates the strength and resilience of our business model through a wide range of environments. Now turning our attention to the balance sheet. The big story last year, of course, was the roughly 30% decline in client cash on our balance sheet, of which over 80% moved in the first-half of the year. This was the outcome of clients moving some of their cash into higher-earning alternatives, as Walt mentioned, that was often with our active support and encouragement. And importantly, that money is staying at Schwab, as evidenced by the approximately $200 billion increase in purchase money funds and over $225 billion increase in fixed income in CDs our clients hold. And we supported some of that activity by utilizing temporary or supplemental borrowing, including both FHLB advances and Schwab Bank CDs. And at just under $80 billion at the end of the quarter, those have fallen by more than $17 billion from the peak level reached in May. And finally, our capital position continues to get even stronger with our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio rising to 8.5% and our adjusted Tier 1 leverage ratio, inclusive of AOCI, and therefore what our binding constraint would be if we lose the AOCI opt-out, at Schwab Bank now nearly 5.4%, meaning we are now meeting what will likely be the new quote well capitalized standard at our banks over four years ahead of the anticipated full implementation date. During last quarter's update, we talked about the slowing pace of client cash realignment over the preceding months. And in November, our clients actually added to their transactional cash balances. And then in December, we saw an approximately $15 billion increase in transactional sweep cash. Now, historically, December flows benefit from seasonal factors, but even so, when you compare December 2023 to December 2022, it is quite clear that this dynamic is receding as an important driver for us. You can also see that trend when you look at purchase money fund flows and specifically that minority of those net flows that are funded from client cash on the balance sheet. Now, as we turn our attention to 2024, our near-term financial performance will, as always, be shaped by external factors that are difficult to predict. Interest rates, equity market performance, and client trading activity. And then given the much larger sensitivity to client cash allocations, given where interest rates are today than they were, let's say three years ago, that will, of course, be a significant factor. So let's talk about this one. And given the importance of this, let's spend a bit more time here. There are really three main forces that will influence the trend of our clients' transactional cash during 2024. Any remaining client cash realignment from existing clients, the contribution of cash we attract from new clients, which I'll talk about in a moment, is the source of the greatest uncertainty moving forward, and seasonal dynamics that are generally similar every year, but can vary based on environmental conditions. We'll start with the behavior of our existing clients. And as we've discussed, we're clearly in the very late innings of the client cash realignment activity. You can see it in the monthly reporting we have shared, whether you look at total balances, balances per account, or cash as a percent of assets. And that high level trend is supported by various dynamics you see when you look under the hood. We're seeing stabilization of activity among both RIA and retail clients. Now we've talked about how cash realignment is an event, not a process. And we're seeing a decrease in both the number of those events and the average amount of the cash being realigned. Now while we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to predict the behavior of our existing clients, it's a bit harder to do so with new clients over a very short timeframe, like a year. Now, that contribution depends on the level of new clients we attract and the size of those accounts. And then how much of the net new assets comes in the form of cash and stays there, which will be influenced by investor sentiment, quantitative tightening by the Fed, inflation, savings rates, and so forth. And then you throw in that this is an election year, which normally brings an elevated degree of volatility, makes these predictions even tougher. And what this means is that while we have seen throughout our history that over time, cash balances grow with the growth in accounts and assets, over a shorter period, like a quarter or a year, it's harder to gauge exactly how much new accounts will contribute. And finally, the evolution of transactional cash over the course of 2024 is likely to be influenced by seasonal patterns, which follow a similar trajectory every year, but can vary in terms of their magnitude. That means we're seeing some cash getting invested into the markets in the first quarter. And given the large inflows we saw in December, the investment activity could be at an elevated start this year. And then we'll likely see a reduction in April as clients pay taxes before we cap the year with an anticipated buildup in December. So what does all this mean for our 2024 financial performance? Given the various moving pieces, we decided to bring back a concept you may recall we last used in 2019, which is to share with you a couple of mathematical illustrations around how our financial performance could unfold, based on what happens with certain and difficult to predict inputs. And those are trading activity. We looked at flat to 2023 levels, plus or minus 5%. And where transactional cash finishes the year relative to the 12/31 levels. Again, flat plus 5% or minus 10%. Those illustrations share a couple of common and pretty conventional assumptions. Most importantly, normal market appreciation and rates that follow the dot plots. And those illustrations could result in revenue that is plus or minus 5% there are 2023 levels or said another way, revenue that is 0% to 10% higher than our annualized Q4 2023 run rate, even with three rate cuts. We're planning, as we've shared previously, to keep adjusted expenses flat year-over-year. And that would result in an adjusted pre-tax margin of a little under 40% to somewhere in the mid-40s. Now I know it's tempting to pick the mid-point of the illustrations and interpret that as our outlook. That is not how these illustrations are intended to be used. This is just math. Using some metrics, you can track on an ongoing basis to evolve your own perspectives on our potential performance over time. And as we typically do, we have included in the appendix a set of sensitivities intended to help you make adjustments as you see fit. Now looking at the range of possibility, it doesn't apply much of any growth in terms of full year adjusted EPS. But given the consistent pay down in the higher cost supplemental borrowing, it suggests strong sequential momentum in revenue and in earnings. With a potential exit velocity heading into 2025, that is at least 20% better than where we ended 2023. And with increasing momentum as we progress through 2025 as well. Let's drill a little deeper into the expense story. Schwab has been and always will be a growth company, a company that continually invests in improving the client experience. At the same time, we're a company that recognizes that one of our biggest competitive advantages, as Walt mentioned, is our industry-leading cost structure, which is measured as EOCA. Achieving both of those requires careful balance and discipline. And in 2024, even as we're holding spending flat, we're still making significant investments that Rick talked about that will help sustain our long-term organic growth, boost our revenue, and increase our efficiency during 2024 and beyond. Our current revenue and earnings are being pressured, of course, by our utilization of the higher cost funding in the form of CDs and FHLB advances. Those are very much a temporary funding source. And as we pay off those, we continue to see a path towards a net interest margin in the 2.20% to 2.50% range by the end of this year and approaching 3% by the end of 2025 even if rates fall roughly 200 basis points from where they are today, as the dot plots would indicate, with a potential for it to expand further moving forward as we reinvest our securities portfolio at higher market rates than what we currently earn. Now while we pause our buyback in order to build our capital levels, capital return remains a very important part of our financial formula, given our very high return on capital and negligible credit exposure. Our capital levels have already reached the so-called well-capitalized threshold, even if AOCI is included. And we'd expect our consolidated adjusted Tier 1 leverage ratio to reach the upper 6% range by the end of 2024, at which point we'll be in a position to at least consider resuming opportunistic buybacks. Both Walt and I talked about 2024 being somewhat of a transitional year from a financial standpoint, but we also talked about the steady improvement we expect to see throughout the year. In some ways, I hate to use the phrase coiled spring, but I think that's exactly what is being set up as we move into 2025, as we complete the Ameritrade integration, creating a true best of breed platform and unlocking both revenue and expense synergies. We continue to advance our strategic agenda even as we maintain flat expenses. Transactional cash balances inflect and we begin to see sustained growth. And all that plus continued business momentum creates an opportunity for a return to sequential revenue growth and accelerating momentum toward the end of the year and into 2025. And that paves the way for a return to our long-term financial formula. One that is powered by our position as the premier asset gatherer, producing consistent 5% to 7% organic growth through the cycle with industry-leading client loyalty and a leadership position in the two fastest growing segments within wealth management. One that has a proven ability to expand margins through the cycle with the potential for even more dramatic margin expansion in the years ahead, back above 50% as revenue benefits from paying off higher cost borrowings and expenses benefits from harvesting the remaining expense energies. And one that can combine that strong organic growth and revenue growth with more meaningful capital return as our capital levels inclusive of AOCI march higher. And so when you take a step back and look at our potential financial performance, your perspective depends on your time frame. In the immediate term, we have been dealing with some pressures that have constrained our financial results. But those pressures are temporary, not permanent. So long-term opportunity, the long-term potential remains significant. And as an organization that has a long time horizon, that is what fuels our optimism, our confidence, and our excitement for what lies ahead. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff to facilitate our Q&A. Jeff? Sure. So, the biggest driver of the growth in NIM from where we are today to 3% is continuing to pay off those supplemental borrowings. We don't necessarily need deposits to grow, although we obviously expect that will happen between now and 2025. We don't need deposits to actually grow to be able to do that. Remember, we've got probably $11 billion or $12 billion per quarter in cash flow coming from the investment portfolio. That's cash, that's earning roughly 2% today and we can use that to pay off supplemental borrowing that's costing us, lets's say,on average 5%. And so that's a significant NIM advantage and NIR [] advantage and revenue advantage that we're able to generate every month we don't \u2013 that we have even flat deposits. So that's really the biggest driver between -- for the NIM growth between now and the end of 2025 and frankly between now and the end of 2024 as well. Yes, thanks. Thanks, Kyle, for the question. So I think it's reasonable to think that the betas could be a bit higher on the way down than they were on the way up. At 45 basis points in bank suite, we're paying a rate today that is significantly better than what traditional banks are offering on checking accounts. They're still paying, I think in many cases, 1 basis point or 2 basis points for accounts that have similar liquidity features or in some cases even inferior liquidity features. And so I wouldn't necessarily assume that the deposit betas on the way down will be symmetrical to where they were on the way up necessarily. Yes, thanks for the question. So the map out the illustrations are based on the dot plots, which again, so three cuts over the course of \u201824 and I think it's 200 basis points by the end of 2025 of easing. In terms of the pace of interest-earning assets, our priority is to pay off the supplemental borrowing. And so as we continue to prioritize that, it's reasonable to expect that our interest-earning assets would decline. Again, doing so, you can be in a situation where interest rate assets are declining, but revenue is increasing because again, we're paying off those supplemental borrowings. Of that $11 billion to $12 billion of quarterly cash flow from the investment portfolio, a portion of that is principal and then, of course, a portion of that is interest. So I wouldn't assume that the interesting assets are going down by that, necessarily by that level. But I do think it's reasonable to expect that there will be some decline as long as we have the supplemental borrowings outstanding, we're endeavoring to pay those off as quickly as possible. Yes, so we saw, you know, I think if you look at the end of the year with our -- we target in the banks kind of a 5% to 6% overnight liquidity at the banks.

            "name": "Walt Bettinger",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our January Business Update. We're here in Frigid Westlake, Texas, where I think it was 15 degrees when I hopped in the vehicle this morning to come to the office. But Happy New Year and again, thank you all for joining us. So as we close the book on 2023 and begin thinking about 2024, it seems like a natural time to reflect on the year that just closed. It was certainly a challenging year for our clients, for our stockholders, and for us. Perhaps it was the most challenging in my time at Schwab, certainly the most challenging since the bursting of the Internet bubble in 2000. And yet at the same time, I couldn't be more excited about the opportunities before us. In 2024, you're going to see an emphasis on execution, but with consistency around our strong client fundamentals and strategy. I recognize that 2024 is going to be a transition year from a financial standpoint, albeit one with steadily improving financial results throughout the year and a very strong exit into 2025. It's unrealistic to think that the challenges of 2023 simply disappear, because the calendar flips over. But when I look ahead to 2025, 2026, and 2027, I'm quite confident that the power of our client franchise is going to shine in terms of financial results. There's much work to do in 2024 and beyond, and no one at Schwab is kidding themselves that everything is perfect right now. But my confidence is high. I'm incredibly encouraged by what I see, whether it's our positioning, our client relationships, the solutions that we offer our clients, or the focus of the entire organization on the future. If I could take you back in time to the mid-2000s, that was a period when Chuck first began speaking with me about the possibility of becoming CEO someday. And as a result of those discussions, I went on a listening tour of former very Senior Executives of Schwab. My goal is simply to ask them their views on the firm and our prospects for the future. It's important to keep in mind that many of them had been let go or terminated in the turmoil that followed the Internet bubble bursting. They had experienced this incredible run-up in the value of the firm, followed by the pain of multiple rounds of employee layoffs and a stock price that had collapsed from the \u201850s to mere single digits. And although each of them used different words, they all basically said the same thing they were fearful that Schwab Best Days were in the past. I tried to absorb their counsel and their feedback objectively, of course, I was balancing the personal challenges that they had each been through as I listen to their feedback. But I fundamentally did not believe that the firm's best days were in the past. There were far too many strengths for me to believe that. And over a few years, with a lot of hard work by many people, I believe it's pretty clear that we proved them wrong. As our stock price grew over ten-fold and assets, the clients entrusted us with grew similarly. I understand that today there are some who might be asking similar questions, but I am confident that our Best Days are ahead of us. In my opinion, after four decades in this business, there is no firm better positioned for the future. No firm has our breadth of client solutions, investing, trading, custody, advisory workplace. And all delivered with an incredible value for investors and advisors. I expect us to make steady progress in both client flows and financial performance throughout this upcoming year, and then I fully expect us to deliver outstanding results over the following years. So let's go ahead and dig in to 2023. It was a year of many twists and turns for our investor clients as well as for our stockholders. And all the while we made substantial progress on the largest acquisition related conversion in the history of our industry. Coming on off a difficult 2022 for investors, the first quarter of 2023 began with turmoil in the regional banking world. Investor sentiment bounced between negative and positive throughout the year before eventually ending quite positive. Equity returns were strong in 2023, although largely concentrated in a modest number of stocks. For Schwab stockholders, it was a difficult year. Our stock lost about 17% of its value. The core reasoning behind most of this decline is our commitment to proactively following our through-client size strategy. Because throughout 2022 and 2023, we reached out to our clients and encouraged them to move their yield-sensitive, or what we sometimes refer to as longer-term investment cash, into higher-yielding alternatives. And they did, to the tune of several $100 billion. And an and aside although these actions have temporally impacted our revenue and earnings, we would do the same thing every time. The client loyalty that we build by being proactive will pay dividends in the long-term as clients continue to entrust us with their investment dollars. Progress on the Ameritrade conversion was exceptional with about 90% of the client accounts and assets all accurately and successfully converted. And despite the substantial focus on this effort, we continue to make real progress on other client-related initiatives that help set the table for future organic growth. Let's go ahead on this slide and take a deeper look into 2023 from the lens of our investor clients. The open market committee of the federal reserve continued to recover from the mistaken transitory inflation viewpoint they raised rates multiple times in 2023 before peaking at close to 5.5%, as inflation began to ease directionally toward the Fed's long-term goal of 2%. And although equity markets continue to be volatile, ultimate returns were actually quite strong, with the S&P 500 rising over 20% and the NASDAQ composites increasing over 40%. Investor sentiment was also volatile throughout 2023. It recovered rather dramatically in the fourth quarter of the year from a strong bear sentiment in the third quarter and ended the year with a solid bullish viewpoint. But despite this mixed sentiment, our clients remained highly engaged with the markets and with Schwab. Clients were net purchasers of equities last year by a 1.2 to 1 ratio, and although trading activity was about 10% lower than in 2022, it was still much higher than pre-pandemic levels. And net flows into our retail advisory solutions were a very strong $33 billion. Last year was a solid year in terms of client flows for our firm, particularly given the volatility of the markets and the negative sentiment that existed throughout much of the year. Core net new assets were slightly above $300 billion, and core net new assets from clients who originally opened their accounts with Schwab were about $30 billion higher. The difference, of course, reflecting the attrition from certain former Ameritrade clients. Now in terms of the Ameritrade conversion, we've converted approximately 90% of the accounts and assets, that totals about $1.6 trillion in assets and 15 million accounts. And we'll convert the balance in May of this year. There's no question that this conversion has been a success. Attrition continues to track below the estimates that we shared in 2019 when the transaction was announced. Of course, we hate losing any clients, but we're realistic that some attrition is to be expected, and also knowing that we would be proactively stepping away from serving certain former Ameritrade clients for a variety of logical reasons. Stepping back a bit to look at the bigger picture, we are committed to our through client-side strategy, and it underlines our no tradeoffs execution. We believe the backbone of organic growth is delivered by focusing on four areas: value, service, transparency, and trust with both our clients, as well as our prospects. Now the ultimate measure of value for clients is the balance between the quality of service and guidance they receive and the revenue we earn that pays for this service and guidance. And we don't believe any investment services firm delivers a better value than Schwab. The quality of our service is well recognized, and I'm going to go ahead and speak on that a little bit more momentarily. And the revenue we earn averages less than one quarter of 1%. In fact, we've almost halved what clients pay us in one form or another over the past 20-years. When you compare that to what investors pay certain wirehouses or independent broker dealers or regionals, Schwab clients paid between approximately half or even in some cases close to a quarter of what they pay these other firms. Now that difference adds up to an enormous drag on client wealth creation over the years. It's one of the key structural advantages that clients of Charles Schwab benefit from. And we've been recognized for many years as a leader in client service in the financial services world. And despite the complexities inherent in the Ameritrade conversion, we retained our world-class results in 2023 for client service. Our net promoter score in our retail business remained in the mid-60s, while our overall speed to answer phone calls was about 30 seconds, with retail averaging just below 20 seconds last year. Now these metrics are very important as our reputation for service and creating client loyalty extends across all of our client-facing businesses. Delivering world-class service is a never-ending area of emphasis, requires training, investment in digital and self-service capabilities, as well as a philosophical deep belief in the nobility of service. Service has always been at the core of our success at Schwab and will always remain so. Transparency is also a hallmark of Schwab, whether it be defined as our open architecture approach to investing, the clarity of any fees or charges assessed to our clients, or the fact that we've been a leader in both guaranteeing the security of our clients' assets, as well as their overall satisfaction. Our satisfaction guarantee is unique across the industry. It's provided our clients with the confidence they deserve as they make investment decisions. And although the payments we've historically made under this satisfaction guarantee are relatively modest, we believe deeply in the philosophy of guaranteeing our clients delight with our services and guidance. We often say at Schwab that we are less in the investment business than we are in the trust business. And this was never more true than in 2023. As clients wanted to access their client cash that we held at our banks, we ensured they had ample liquidity to move that cash into money market funds, bonds, treasuries or other investments. And while this happened more quickly than we would have expected given the unparalleled pace of Fed rate moves, our contingency plans worked as designed to ensure that we could always be there to support our clients. As a result, during a period of heightened concern about bank stability across the industry last spring, our clients were able to have confidence in Schwab. We're honored that both JD Power and Investor's Business Daily gave our firm and our bank the highest scores in the areas of investor satisfaction and trust, respectively, last year. And we're committed to maintaining and building trust with our clients in the years to come. Before I turn it over to Rick, I want to take a moment to remind everyone that our strategies, our philosophies, and our execution at Schwab are not random. We evaluate everything we do by screening it through a series of lens that apply our experience and knowledge about the investing industry, both today as well as where it's headed in the future. We categorize these viewpoints into three buckets and they may look familiar to those of you who've dialed into our calls in the past. Broad trends, client views, and the competitive landscape. If I were to highlight the viewpoints on these three buckets, it would be: first, we are ideally positioned to benefit from growth in the areas of the industry that have grown the fastest in recent years and project the most organic growth potential for the future. Self-directed investors and traders, RIAs serving as a fiduciary to their clients, and low-cost, tax-aware investing. Next, clients are looking for firms that offer a breadth of solutions that are personalized for them and make sense within the context of a financial plan. Ideally, firms should be able to assist clients with both sides of their balance sheet, investing and borrowing. We believe the future will be won by firms that find the right balance between offering digital and mobile efficiency on par with non-financial services experience and of course paired with access to well-trained and credentialed professionals. Not surprising, given our viewpoints, we believe Schwab is optimally positioned for long-term organic growth. Rick, let me turn it over to you. Thanks, Ken. I think when you look at NNA in very short periods of time, you have to really evaluate sentiment more so than what the market did. When I spoke at the end of the third quarter last October, sentiment was very negative. And although it slipped by the end of the year, that's a late change within the year. And so when you have negative sentiment historically, when we look at longer time horizons, you're going to get lower levels of NNA. And so I think it's not what the market does. It's what the sentiment of the investor is. We don't see any reason to believe that net new assets are likely to be constrained over a longer period of time relative to historic levels. Our promoter scores, when we look at that, as they're reported on the retail side remain very, very strong. On the advisor side, we have retained virtually all of the advisors that we wanted to retain post integration. So I don't see anything on the horizon that would tell me that long-term you're going to see some form of extended softening in NNA. But short run, you have to look at sentiment and you also have to look at investment options. As rates are higher, people may bring a bit less money to their investment account as opposed to maybe leaving it at a bank where they might just be buying CDs or something of that nature. But nothing structurally gives us cause for concern. Yes, so that, I mean that's why we call that out as I would say an area of uncertainty going forward is because we are seeing, not surprisingly, we're seeing clients who are coming in are realigning their cash as existing clients are. And so that's happening, there's a certain amount of float, if you will, that we typically rely on. That is contributed a little bit less over the previous six months as clients are realigning their cash more quickly maybe than traditionally they would have done. And as rates come down, one would expect that that activity would be a little bit less immediate or timely or to the same extent. And so I think that is one of the uncertainties. What happens with the level of new cash that comes in as the Fed cuts rates 3 times, 4 times, 6 times, whatever it might be. That's why we call that out as an area of uncertainty. But we certainly still expect, as we've seen throughout history, that over time, as we add accounts, as we add assets, again over a longer arc of history, that those transactional cash balances grow with the growth in accounts and the growth in assets. It's just over a short period of time, like a quarter over a year, it's a little bit harder to gauge exactly what the near-term contribution will be. But again, over time, over three years, five years, et cetera, we expect that our total transactional cash balances will grow as we grow our client base."

            "name": "Rick Wurster",
            "content": "Thank you, Walt, and Good morning, everyone. Schwab is in a position of strength to deliver on the client expectations that Walt just spoke about. I'll spend our time together this morning talking about how we delivered for clients in 2023 within the strategic focus areas that you see on this page. I'll also share more about the investments we're making to continue building on our strong foundation, so we can do even more to help our current and future clients meet their financial goals, which in turn will bolster our organic growth and our competitive positioning. I'll start with scale and efficiency. Our number one priority in 2023 was to execute the largest integration in the history of the industry. And it has been a tremendous success. As Walt highlighted, we brought about 90% of Ameritrade clients to Schwab, representing $1.6 trillion in converted assets, 7,000 RIA firms, and 15 million total converted accounts. While clients are getting used to navigating a new experience and a different way of doing things, they are also seeing the breadth of capabilities on our combined platform. We also focused in 2023 on reducing expenses. We captured approximately $500 million in annual run rate expense savings through streamlining our operating model, which included position eliminations from predominantly non-client facing areas, as well as reducing our real estate footprint. The remaining $400 million in Ameritrade expense synergies will be realized in the second-half of 2024 following the completion of the integration. When we think about win-win monetization, we think about meeting more of our clients' total financial needs, including more holistic solutions, lending capabilities, and access to high-quality, fairly priced products. This attracts and retains client assets and at the same time improves our economics. We generated strong results in our advice business with a 29% year-over-year increase in net advised flows, including $12 billion in net flows into our proprietary full-service wealth management solution, Schwab Wealth Advisory. This is a record for our firm. Wasmer Schroeder net flows were $6.7 billion, a record for the offer and a 90% increase over the prior year. And when it comes to direct indexing, we've enhanced our Schwab personalized indexing offer with expanded customization capabilities, a new account level digital dashboard, and digital enrollment. We launched our fully digital Pledged Asset Line, or PAL, for RIA clients that gives advisors the ability to submit a PAL application in minutes, and clients can get approved in hours for straightforward applications and in just days for complex situations. We also launched Schwab Investing Themes, which allows self-directed investors to buy and sell themes of securities that align with their personal interests and values, all available through schwab.com as well as our mobile app. Finally, our goal in the third focus area is to see through clients' eyes to meet the unique needs of each of our clients' segments. Highlights from the last year include introducing our specialized asset-based segments for retail high net worth and ultra-high net worth clients, which we call Schwab Private Client Services and Schwab Private Wealth Services. These tailored offers meet the unique needs of these clients who represent about 70% of our retail assets. Schwab Private Client Services includes access to a financial consultant, dedicated service, expanded access to specialists, as well as products and fee discounts. Schwab Private Wealth Service delivers all that plus prioritized service, enhanced support, expedited requests, priority access to wealth specialists and exclusive events, pricing benefits, American Express Statement Credit, bank benefits, and more. We also in 2023 launched Schwab Trading powered by Ameritrade, a reimagined trading experience made possible by the combination of the best of Schwab and Ameritrade. All clients can now access the thinkorswim trading platform, giving them access to a unique combination of powerful tools and dedicated service from experienced trading professionals alongside education for all levels of experience. We also in 2023 enhanced our offer for all RIA clients. All clients can now access thinkpipes, our thinkpipes trading platform, which offers real-time charting, pre and post-trade allocations, and complex options functionality. In addition, we launched Ameritrade's iRebal and Model Market Center on Schwab Advisor Center, and are taking a measured approach to ensure a seamless onboarding experience for new iRebal users, with general access rolling out early this year. Finally, we acquired the family wealth alliance to expand our capabilities to serve both single-family and multi-family offices. As we look ahead in 2024, we will continue to focus on and make investments in our key strategic focus areas to drive our organic growth, fuel our virtuous cycle, and help clients achieve their financial goals. One thing I'll point out about this page is that given our focus on continuing to make Schwab an easy place to do business, we are adding a fourth pillar to our strategic focus areas called EASE, which is about delivering exceptional and easy experiences to our clients. With 35 million client accounts, serving our clients exceptionally well will be a big driver of our organic growth. When we think about scale and efficiency, we're laser focused on successfully converting the final Ameritrade client transition group and then capturing our remaining expense synergies. We'll continue making investments in artificial intelligence to empower our teams to serve clients even more effectively. And finally, we will invest in automation and systems modernization over the next several years, allowing us to drive greater efficiency. Win-win monetization remains an important opportunity where we can both delight clients and boost our revenue. Looking ahead, we'll continue to make investments to enable clients to keep more of their financial life with us, including a continued focus on lending capabilities that meets the needs of more clients across both IS and AS. We'll enhance our wealth and advice offerings, including making continued investments in Schwab Wealth Advisory. We'll continue to build on our momentum with personalized investing solutions, and we'll continue to broaden the breadth and depth of product offerings with new offers like alternative investments. And we continue to do work to integrate the workplace experience more into Schwab, allowing our workplace clients to benefit from all we have to offer at Schwab. Within client segmentation, we'll remain focused on meeting the unique needs of our client segments, including our higher net worth clients, traders, and RIAs. Part of this is providing differentiated client experiences, just as we've done this year with the new retail high net worth and ultra-high net worth offers that I spoke to earlier. This also means enhanced service models, specialized capabilities, our powerful trading platform, and our tailored education. Our fourth focus area is Ease. With the size of our asset base, we can drive growth by simply delivering easy and exceptional experiences to our existing clients. This is where you'll see us continue to invest to make Schwab the easiest place in the industry to do business. And it's important to remember something Walt highlighted earlier. Our client's frame of reference for Ease is not just other financial services firms, it's the experiences they have on Amazon or Uber or DoorDash, and that's the measure of ease we are striving to accomplish. We want every experience a client has with us to be an exceptional one. That means we'll continue to make enhancements on all of our channels. We'll continue to digitize client workflows and to make sure our clients have access when and where they want it, whether that's on schwab.com or the mobile app, or when they call or chat with our service teams or walk into a branch. We believe that the combination of these efforts will help power our long-term organic growth. Guided by our seeing through client-size strategy, we are well positioned to retain our clients and to win new ones, fueling our organic NNA growth over the long-term. I've spoken about Schwab's unique strengths in this forum in the past. We have a top one or two position in the two fastest growing segments of financial services. Our strengths will help us attract assets from our existing clients, including our younger client base, valuable dedicated relationships, strong RIA growth, and our emphasis on ease. We'll attract new clients for the combination of the strength of our brand, our proven retail acquisition model, and our continued commitment to serving RIAs. And with the four strategic focus areas I just talked through, we'll be able to meet evolving client needs while making it easier for clients to keep more of their financial lives with us, helping us attract NNA over the long-term. Schwab's future is bright, and before I turn it over to Peter, I'd like to spend just a couple more minutes talking about some of the exciting opportunities ahead. One of our biggest opportunities is to fully harness the powerful combination of Schwab and Ameritrade. While it is still relatively early days, when we look at our Ameritrade clients, we know they are already benefiting from the breadth of Schwab's capabilities, including both lending and wealth. 95% of former Ameritrade FCs have helped the client find a solution to their needs by enrolling them in a Schwab wealth solution. And former Ameritrade FCs accounted for about 20% of our record Schwab wealth advisory net flows in 2023. Today's, former Ameritrade client advice penetration is at approximately 10%, which is above historical levels. Schwab clients are benefiting as well. We launched the new Schwab trading powered by Ameritrade experience in October, and at year-end, more than 80,000 Schwab clients had created new thinkorswim accounts. And about 20% of new to firm retail clients opted to access a thinkorswim account. The opportunity ahead for us is tremendous. We have about a 12% share of the market, and we serve the two fastest growing segments. I just spoke about our early wins and increasing Ameritrade advice penetration. As we continue to win here, we believe we have a $500 billion plus share of wallet NNA opportunity ahead of us. And we believe the win-win monetization opportunities I've spoken about represent a 3.5 billion to 4 billion wealth management and bank lending revenue opportunity. To wrap up, our through-client size strategy continues to guide us into the next chapter. We're in the final stages of the Ameritrade integration, and we've made meaningful progress across our key strategic focus areas in the last year. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to continue our healthy organic growth, and the opportunities in front of us remain highly attractive, both for Schwab and for our clients. And with that I'll turn it over to Peter. Devin, thanks for the question on AI. I think it will have a meaningful impact in three areas on our employees, on our efficiency, and on our clients. Let me start with employees, I think AI can be used to make our employees even more effective with our clients, to provide them with the ability to have an answer that is really strong and in particular for our newer employees that are coming up to speed, the ability for AI to make them as efficient or as effective as a more experienced employee. I think will be powerful both for the employee and for our clients that are receiving the thought from that person. So I think there's a lot of benefits in helping make our employees more effective with clients. There's clearly an efficiency opportunity in AI, and here with 1,000s of phone reps that we hire each year, at some point, we likely will have the opportunity to hire less in a particular year, because we've made our reps both on the phone, on chat, in our branches even more effective and efficient, because we're powering them with information and putting it at their fingertips. And then I think there's a lot of client benefits that will come from AI. We have what I believe is the world's best trading platform in thinkorswim. And a lot of clients invest years and years into building out their platform, into building out their alerts and what types of signals they're looking at to drive what they may want to buy. And I think the opportunity for our clients to leverage an AI-driven research platform will provide them with even greater insights into how they trade, into what positions they might want to put on, into what risks they may need to be aware of. And so I think AI will directly impact clients in the future. So what I think about both making our employees as effective as possible, becoming as efficient as possible, and driving great, fine outcomes. I think AI will play an important role in all three."

        "content": "Jeff Edwards: Hello, and welcome to the Schwab 2023 Fall Business Update. This is Jeff Edwards, Head of Investor Relations, and I\u2019m joined today by our pair of presenters, Co-Chairman and CEO, Walt Bettinger; President, Rick Wurster; and CFO, Peter Crawford. We have plenty to cover today, so I\u2019m certainly going to get out of the way here pretty quickly, but let\u2019s touch on a few housekeeping matters. Similar to past events, I\u2019ll be helping facilitate Q&A. And another friendly reminder to please adhere to the one question, no follow-up format. As always, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to your friendly IR team with any clarifying or other reconciling questions. The slides for today\u2019s business update will be posted to the IR website at the beginning of Peter\u2019s section. And finally, the forward-looking statements page in all its glory, which reminds us all that the future is indeed uncertain, so please stay in touch with our ongoing disclosures. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Walt.\nWalter Bettinger: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our October business update. Rick, Peter and I are excited to share good news with you as we review our third quarter. You\u2019ll hear about our tremendous progress in the conversion of former Ameritrade clients over to Schwab, our ongoing success serving clients and gathering assets, the significant opportunity for ongoing organic growth and marked improvement in some of the key indicators that have attracted outsized attention recently, including the pace of client cash realignment. But maybe most importantly, you\u2019ll hear about the consistency of our strategy, our ideal positioning in the fastest-growing segments of the investment services industry, our ever strengthening position as the low-cost provider, the world-class trust and confidence our clients place in us, our superior pretax profit margins even during one of the most difficult environments possible for our financial model and our commitment to disciplined ongoing investments designed to drive organic growth for many years to come. Now certainly, I understand that the overall backdrop of the environment today is decidedly negative. And I understand that for some, it might be easier to look at the near-term challenges we face at Schwab. I encourage you to consider the entirety of our position and the potential it creates for the future. So the actions of the Federal Reserve to recover from their mistaken transitory inflation viewpoint continue to reverberate across the financial markets. These actions are slowing the rate of inflation, but at a significant cost to the markets, to consumers, to investors and to firms like Schwab. While short-term interest rates continued to rise over the past year, longer-term rates are now also rising. During the third quarter, investors began to feel this pain. They acknowledge it as investor sentiment plunged during the quarter, moving down into bear market sentiment. First, it\u2019s not surprising as both equity and fixed income markets continue to suffer. Cash was virtually the only safe place to invest. An interesting perspective as at Schwab, we have always believed that cash should be a key part of every investor\u2019s long-term investment portfolio. I think it\u2019s particularly important to look at the chart on the bottom of this slide and place ourselves in the minds of investors, who viewed their bonds as conservative ballast against the expected volatility of equity markets. Even those who maintained shorter bond holdings of two to five years have seen substantial declines in their assets between 7% and 13%. Again, truly, there have been a few places for investors to go in recent times to avoid losses other than in cash. And of course, at Schwab, we\u2019ve been similarly impacted by falling bond prices and a rush to cash investments. But throughout this period, our clients have continued to trust us, continue to be loyal and continue to recommend Schwab as a place for their friends and family to invest. And third parties clearly feel the same way with Schwab Bank recently named, by a wide margin incidentally, the most trusted bank in the industry by Investor\u2019s Business Daily. And Schwab was ranked by J.D. Power as number one in investor satisfaction among full-service wealth management firms. I share these third-party endorsements, not because we place undue weight on them, but as a reminder that our strong client positioning contributes to our optimism for ongoing organic growth. And the metrics back this up. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve captured approximately $230 billion in core net new assets and opened well over 2 million new brokerage accounts. Of course, these firm-wide new asset figures reflect the expected attrition from the integration of Ameritrade clients. And of course, the July and August net new asset figures were impacted as some of the 7,000 RIA firms from Ameritrade opted to find alternative custodians ahead of our Labor Day conversion by either their decision or in cases, by ours. And while this attrition weighed on our net new assets for those two months, it was less than what we had allowed for in our original deal-related modeling, and it has largely passed. Looking only at clients who originally opened their accounts at Schwab, we\u2019ve captured approximately $250 billion in core net new assets year-to-date, an increase of about 12% year-over-year, again, illustrating the strength of the business. And that works out to an over 6% organic growth rate. So let me pivot here for a few moments, speak more in depth about the Ameritrade acquisition and progress on our integration efforts. We announced the deal in late 2019, merely a few months before the COVID pandemic hit. At the time of that deal announcement, Ameritrade had approximately $1.3 trillion in client assets, 12 million client brokerage accounts and was processing about 1.3 million trades per day. By the time we got to year-end 2022, these figures had grown substantially to approximately $1.8 trillion in client assets, 16.6 million client brokerage accounts and amazingly, about 3.6 million trades per day. Now from the day the deal was approved by stockholders and regulators, we began an integration process that we referred to as best of both. It means that unlike in most acquisitions where the acquired firm\u2019s clients are merely ported over to the acquiring firm\u2019s platforms, we instead carefully evaluated the capabilities of both firms and build capabilities that would maintain and leverage the best of both firms\u2019 services and platforms. This approach was consistent with our through clients\u2019 eyes strategy. And we believe it also sets up the combined firm in an ideal position for long-term organic growth after the integration is complete. So where are we today? We\u2019ve completed 3 of 5 total transition groups. These groups make up about 80% of the total Ameritrade retail clients and 100% of the RIA firms who previously custodied their client assets with Ameritrade. To date, we\u2019ve executed this integration level of accuracy and service that I have not previously seen in any conversion. During the three conversions to date, our speed to answer client phone calls has averaged less than one minute. And with our largest conversion over the Labor Day weekend now completed, we are averaging 45 complaints for 1 million of converted accounts. I just want to reemphasize that. 45 complaints for 1 million of converted accounts. Just to put that into context, client escalations during the meme stock activity in early 2021, there were approximately 200 escalations for 1 million accounts. Now clearly, there is an adjustment period for some of our clients as they familiarize themselves with new processes, new websites, new mobile apps, and we continue to make enhancements in every one of these areas. Now the work is far from done. But even the most negative observers have acknowledged the skill and attention to detail that is going into our integration efforts, and clients are responding. Former Ameritrade retail clients are rewarding us with levels of loyalty and retention that are far better than we anticipated when we announced the acquisition back in 2019. And similarly, attrition from former Ameritrade RIA custodial clients is also below our estimates, even taking into consideration the substantial amount of assets that we actively moved away from because we felt these firms did not either fit our risk profile at Schwab or who would be better served by converting to an alternative custodian, given the RIA firm\u2019s emphasis on maintaining a substantial sales commission-driven business model. And as we\u2019ve communicated, almost all RIA attrition occurs before the conversion date because the firm considering leaving Schwab would not want their employees and clients to learn our new processes and technology only to switch to a different custodian and have to relearn all new processes and technology at that new custodian. We carefully tracked all RIA firms and their engagement with the many seminars and planning events that we offered prior to the conversion weekend. And not surprisingly, those firms who took advantage of these programs, which make up the majority of the client assets, have had the smoothest pass \u2013 path to conversion. And lastly, the vast majority of active former Ameritrade RIA firms are operating their businesses, placing trades and already opening new accounts on the Schwab platform. Where RIA firms have offered us suggestions for enhancements and improvements, we\u2019re fast at work making these, and we\u2019re grateful to the firms for their ideas. When we complete the final two transition groups, we are confident that we will have the broadest, most robust offering in investment services for individual investors and the advisers who serve them from industry-leading advisory solutions to world-class trading platforms, banking solutions at exceptional pricing, award-winning digital content and investor education, including the newly renamed Schwab Network, 24/7, 365 phone service combined with almost 400 branches for in-person planning and service, value pricing that is supported by what we believe is the lowest cost structure in the industry and a rich history of client-benefiting disruption. Rick, before I turn it over to you, I want to take a moment to review a slide that I\u2019ve shared in the past. Despite the environment, despite the noise, we are supremely confident in our positioning for long-term growth. As we mentioned earlier, we are ideally positioned among the fastest-growing segments of investment services. Our competitive advantages are unmatched, and our current domestic market share is modest at approximately 12%. I truly believe the opportunity before us is quite bright. Rick?\nRick Wurster: Thank you, Walt, and good morning, everyone. I want to spend our time today talking about how we\u2019ve driven 5% to 7% organic growth historically and how we plan to drive it in the future through our model of generating 3% to 5% of NNA growth from our existing clients and 2% to 3% of growth from new clients and a return on our strategic focus areas. Our through clients\u2019 eyes strategy has allowed us to generate 3% to 5% growth from existing clients. When clients turn to Schwab, they know they will get industry-leading value, exceptional service and transparency in every interaction they have. By treating clients the way they want to be treated, we build trust, and we\u2019re able to deepen relationships and capture a greater share of wallet. You see this in the 51.2 billion in year-to-date NNA we see from existing retail clients and the 43.4 billion in year-to-date NNA we see from existing adviser clients. We have also been able to consistently drive 2% to 3% asset growth from new clients. This is due in part to our diversified acquisition model, which includes leveraging the strong personal relationships created by our branch footprint and our RIA service model, earning referrals from our delighted clients and deploying data-driven marketing campaigns and investing in complementary acquisition channels, including our workplace business, which I\u2019ll talk more about shortly. Year-to-date, this has driven 744,000 new-to-firm households to our retail business, approximately 60% of whom are under age 40 and approximately 240 adviser and transition teams. The third part of our growth recipe is our continued investment in our strategic focus areas. I\u2019ll start today with scale and efficiency. We shared with you in July that we are taking steps to enhance our flexibility and efficiency with an annual run rate expense savings target of $1 billion plus. Walt spoke earlier about our Ameritrade integration, and one component of our expense savings will come from capturing $500 million in remaining Ameritrade expense synergies. Another $500 million plus in annual savings will come from streamlining our operating model, which includes eliminating positions from predominantly non-client-facing areas and reducing our real estate footprint. As we previously shared, these actions are expected to result in a non-GAAP expense charge of $400 million to $500 million, a portion of which you saw in our results this morning, with the remainder to follow either later this year or in 2024. With these actions, we expect year-over-year expense growth to be roughly flat even while we continue to invest aggressively in client products and service. It\u2019s this investment that leads to the win-win monetization I\u2019ll talk about now. One area we are investing in and one I\u2019ve discussed in this forum several times as well. I\u2019ve said it before, there is a bull market for advice. Today, we have approximately $530 billion in retail assets receiving ongoing advisory services. Not only do these clients see Schwab as a place to get advice, but our advice offers have among the highest client promoter scores across all of Schwab. With the investments we\u2019ve made and continue to make, more and more of our retail clients are turning to us for wealth management as they move into a life phase where they need advice. You can see this in our managed investing flows, where we\u2019ve seen year-to-date record highs in Schwab Wealth Advisory, Wasmer Schroeder and Schwab Personalized Indexing. Year-to-date, net flows in the Schwab Wealth Advisory are a record $9.2 billion, up nearly 60% over last year. The third quarter was also a record quarter for Schwab Wealth Advisory with $3.3 billion in flows coming into our flagship wealth solution. Year-to-date net flows in the Wasmer Schroeder are a record $4.5 billion, up nearly 130% over last year. While we believe we are still in the early days, clients and FCs are starting to learn about the potential benefits of direct indexing, and the combination of tax benefits and personalization are attractive to them. Lending is also an increasingly important part of the wealth management relationship, and we\u2019ve recently launched a fully digital onboarding experience that lets advisers access a Pledged Asset Line or a PAL for their clients. The new PAL process reduced the time to submit a PAL application to just minutes and enables clients to be approved in just one to two days. Growing PAL is a win-win opportunity. It\u2019s good for the adviser because it helps them retain assets and compete with banks. And it\u2019s good for Schwab because of the positive spread to securities. Now I\u2019ll turn to another area where we have a win-win monetization opportunity, and that\u2019s our Workplace business. Our Workplace business meets the needs of individuals who become investors through their employers and includes our retirement plan business and our stock plan business, among others. This business is strategic as it allows us to introduce millions of workplace participants to Schwab, many of whom are investing for the very first time, finding us with a pipeline of future retail and adviser services clients. Workplace connects more than 5,500 employers, 2,700 advisory firms and 2.5 million investor households to Greater Schwab. In fact, today, 1 in 3 new-to-firm households at Schwab are originated through our Workplace business. We retained 50% of eligible rollover retirement assets, and our stock plan business contributes about 10% to retail NNA. And finally, nearly 20% of Workplace households have a broader relationship with Schwab. And when they do, they have 4x the assets through those relationships. With Workplace, we have an opportunity to fuel NNA growth for Schwab into the future through our grow, retain and extend approach. To do this, we are making investments to more fully upgrade our workplace digital experiences so participants can benefit from all we have to offer on schwab.com, mobile and with our broader retail offer. And we\u2019re investing in our technology. This will require a multiyear investment, and we\u2019ll provide a deeper dive and more specifics about this opportunity at future updates. I\u2019ll turn now to our third strategic focus area, client segmentation. Last quarter, I talked about our two new branded client experiences within retail, Schwab Private Client Services and Schwab Private Wealth Services for our 1 million-plus and 10 million-plus clients, respectively. This is all about delivering differentiated experiences across relationship, service, operations, product and price. The launch has been very well received by our clients. This quarter, I\u2019ll talk more about our trader offer. Traders are one of our most highly engaged client segments. On average, compared to non-trader retail clients, they bring in 6.5x the NNA and have 3.8x the household assets and generate 2.8x higher ROCA. We\u2019re continuing to invest in this offer to provide the world-class trading experience, traders expect. Just today, we launched our reimagined trader offer, Schwab Trading powered by Ameritrade. With this new experience, we\u2019re combining the best of Schwab and Ameritrade by giving all of our clients access to the thinkorswim and Schwab trading platforms, unparalleled trading education, including many elements of Ameritrade\u2019s trader education offer and specialized service. Traders at Schwab have access to all that Schwab has to offer, wealth management, banking and more. In fact, our virtual active trader branch includes active trader financial consultants, who focus on both trader coaching and wealth management to help meet the unique needs of qualifying traders. We think this offer sets the bar for what a trading experience should be. Putting it all together, with our through clients\u2019 eyes strategy, we are well positioned to consistently generate 5% to 7% organic growth from both existing and new clients. And there is an opportunity ahead as we start to see returns on the investments we\u2019ve made in our strategic focus areas. As we\u2019ve shared in prior quarters, we have an opportunity to close the share of wallet gap between Ameritrade and Schwab clients. And we have an attractive opportunity to delight our retail clients with our wealth management and to delight both our retail and adviser clients with our lending offerings, while growing our revenue. And I\u2019ll wrap up where Walt started. Our relentless focus on serving our clients\u2019 needs creates a clear path to organic growth and delivering long-term value to our clients and stockholders. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Peter.\nPeter Crawford: Thank you very much, Rick. So Walt and Rick talked about how despite a difficult environment, we\u2019re continuing to earn the loyalty and trust of our clients and driving strong organic growth. The enormous progress we have made with the Ameritrade acquisition and the exciting potential that the combination presents for our clients and our stockholders, the other significant growth opportunities we\u2019re pursuing and how we\u2019re working hard to capitalize on those opportunities, continuing to invest in enhancing our platform even as we take steps to strengthen our industry-leading cost advantage. In my time today, I\u2019ll briefly review our third quarter financial performance, update our 2023 scenario and offer some early thoughts on 2024 and beyond. The important point is that in the third quarter, we saw notable improvement across several \"tactical metrics\" on which there has been a lot of focus lately. We might argue too much focus in the context of our ability to create value over time. And I\u2019m referring specifically to the pace of client cash reallocation activity, our capital levels, the level of supplemental borrowing and the trajectory of our net interest margin. When you combine these developments with the measures Walt and Rick shared that demonstrate our strong business momentum, it reinforces our confidence in our ability to move through this part of the economic cycle as we have so many times before and emerge from this period a larger, stronger and even more resilient company. As Walt mentioned, the third quarter was a challenging one for many of our clients and for our business model. And so not surprisingly, our financial performance was off last year\u2019s record levels with a little under $5 billion of revenue and $0.77 of adjusted EPS. And yet, that bottom line performance was better than the second quarter of this year. And with an adjusted pretax margin of over 41%, 30% on a GAAP basis due to the large restructuring charge this quarter, we are navigating from a position of strength. Turning our attention to the balance sheet. Bank deposits were down 7% sequentially due to client cash allocation decisions. But following a brief uptick in that activity in August, the pace slowed dramatically in September. As a result of that slowing activity, we were able to further reduce the amount of supplemental funding we have outstanding. We issued a little over $2 billion in debt to supplement our parent liquidity. And assuming the markets continue to be constructive, we will likely issue a bit more debt primarily to build up extra liquidity ahead of some debt maturities we have early next year. And our capital position continues to get even stronger with our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio rising to 8.2%. And our adjusted Tier 1 leverage ratio, inclusive of AOCI and therefore, what our binding constraint would be if we lose the AOCI opt-out at Schwab Bank now into the mid-4% range, and that\u2019s using average assets, it\u2019s more like 4.6% today on a spot basis, as it steadily climbs towards 5% by the end of the year, meaning that we will be in a position to meet the newly proposed regulatory requirement organically and several years ahead of the anticipated full implementation date. I know there\u2019s a lot of commentary. There has been a lot of commentary about the increased client cash allocation activity in August, activity which seemed to buck the clear trend of deceleration we\u2019ve been experiencing over the previous several months. We said at the time that it felt more like an anomaly. And now having closed the books on September, we have a number of tangible proof points that indicate that outflows are easing, and we\u2019re getting closer to the return of sweep cash growth, including the fact that the overall pace of realignment activity decelerated in September to the lowest level we have seen during the current cycle. We experienced our first month of bank sweep deposit growth since before the hiking cycle started. And both the absolute number and size of client realignment events dropped further from the level we shared last quarter. And all this in spite of an increase in rates across the curve. And while we saw increased flows into purchase money funds, we caution you again not to use those daily flow numbers as a proxy for overall deposit flows. Only around 20% of the purchase money fund purchases lately have been funded with bank sweep in Schwab One with the remainder coming from equities, fixed income or oftentimes money coming from outside Schwab that\u2019s been attracted by our very competitive yields and low expense ratios on those funds. And now we\u2019re now halfway through October, and the trend has largely continued with overall transactional cash balances, including again Schwab One and the IDA in line with the September trend despite delayed tax payments by many of our clients in California and elsewhere. As we have said many times, that trend is not surprising, but it is encouraging. And it brings greater clarity towards our core earnings power. During Walt and Rick\u2019s sections, they talk about some of the measures that demonstrate how we\u2019re continuing to win with clients, metrics such as client promoter score, net new assets, new accounts and our organic growth rate, the deal-related attrition that has been lower than our initial expectations and advice flows. And those are clearly the most important predictors of our long-term success, and all portend a bright future. But the more tactical balance sheet metrics have all trended in a positive direction as well. And we believe we are well on our way towards those indicators returning to more normal levels. The level of supplemental borrowing has continued to fall as the ongoing cash flow generated from our investment portfolio has been more than sufficient to support the slowing deposit bank sweep outflows. And we\u2019d expect this level of temporary borrowing to drop substantially over the next handful of quarters, paving the way for us to resume reinvestment activity in 2025, which, assuming rates follow expectations, will provide a meaningful boost to our net interest margin. Speaking of net interest margin, assuming rates followed the dot plot, we still anticipate it building through 2024 and approaching 3% by the end of 2025. Despite rising interest rates, our adjusted Tier 1 leverage ratio at the banks and for the consolidated corporation rose roughly 40 basis points during the quarter, approaching the level to be considered well capitalized several years before that measure is slated to become our regulatory ratio. And we\u2019d expect those ratios to continue to increase due to continued strong capital formation, the accretion of the unrealized marks back to equity and a reduction of our balance sheet as we pay off the remaining supplemental borrowings, bringing back the potential for opportunistic capital return over time. So what does all this mean for the rest of this year and 2024? Our outlook for this year is pretty similar to what we shared back in July. As client cash allocation activity continues to abate, we still expect to see a return of transactional cash growth later this year. We should see a stabilization of revenue and then a resumption of growth over time and full year 2023 revenue is expected to decline a bit more than the previously mentioned 7% to 8% range. So ultimately, trading volumes and market levels will influence how things shake out. On the expense side, we still expect our 2023 adjusted expense growth to be somewhere in the 6-ish percent range, inclusive of the $160 million onetime FDIC charge that, of course, was not contemplated when we set out our initial spending plan at the beginning of the year, meaning that our other spending is tracking at least 300 basis points below the range we communicated back in January, as we adjust and optimize our expense base consistent with Rick\u2019s earlier comments. Now turning our attention to 2024. We\u2019ll share specific scenarios at our winter business update. But needless to say, the revenue outlook will be shaped by a range of factors, including, of course, path of interest rates in the equity markets, the pace of deposit growth and the level of client engagement. But our expectation is it will make substantial progress in reducing our usage of FHLB advances in CDs. Rick described the work we\u2019re doing on the expense front, and we\u2019d expect that to result in 2024 adjusted expenses that are no higher than 2023. And finally, we\u2019d expect to continue to grow both our regulatory capital ratios and our adjusted Tier 1 leverage ratio, boosting that lateral ratio back above 6.5%, several years before it becomes a formal requirement. There is no doubt that we have been navigating through a difficult environment, but it should be apparent that the core pillars of the multi-decade investment thesis for Schwab are as strong today as ever. We are the premier asset gatherer with industry-leading client loyalty, a strong competitive moat and a leadership position in the 2 fastest-growing segments within wealth management. We have multiple ways to convert that asset growth into revenue growth, including growing advice with both Schwab and Ameritrade clients as well as a long-term NIM tailwind as we eventually reinvest our securities portfolio at much higher prevailing rates. We continue to manage expenses with discipline with $1 billion or more of remaining expense synergies and other efficiency opportunities. And we are a company that has shown the ability to couple strong organic growth with opportunistic capital return, a combination which we\u2019re confident will reemerge in the years ahead. Now admittedly, that powerful combination has been obscured recently by some of the fog as Walt described it back in July, but this fog continues to clear with deal-related attrition abating, allowing our net new assets to return to our normal levels, which are anything but, client cash allocation activity slowing, supplemental borrowing decreasing and our NIM rebounding, expense growth slowing and poised to slow further as we prepare for the significant remaining expense actions in the quarters ahead and our capital levels building despite the headwinds posed by increasing rates. I talked earlier about long-term predictors of success versus more tactical near-term metrics. But when you step back to look at the whole picture, you see a healthy, resilient company with a lot of momentum and a lot of opportunity in front of that. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff to facilitate our Q&A.\nJeff Edwards: Great. Operator, can you please remind everyone how they can queue up and ask a question? And then let\u2019s go ahead and get started.\nOperator: Yes. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nKenneth Worthington: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So interest-earning assets have declined in recent quarters. You mentioned the positive deposit growth for September. And on the last call, you highlighted the expectation that deposits would grow later this year. Given your prioritization for the paydown in short-term borrowing, if current macro trends continue and the forward curve is right, when would you expect to see interest-earning assets trough? And at about what level would you expect them to trough?\nPeter Crawford: Thanks, Ken, for the question. So our expectation is that we will continue to prioritize paying down the supplemental borrowings. That is the fastest way to get to that 3% NIM that we talked about by the end of 2025. So what that could mean is that we could be seeing deposits grow, transactional cash grow even as interest-earning assets are declining because our focus is really on paying down those supplemental borrowings. So that would be \u2013 you could see a scenario where interest-bearing assets are declining, but NIM is growing and actually net interest revenue is growing even as that is happening.\nKenneth Worthington: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Patrick Moley with Piper Sandler. You may go ahead.\nPatrick Moley: Yes, thanks for taking my questions. So great to see the slower cash realignment in September, and appreciate the comments on the 20% of money market fund inflows coming from customer cash. But just wondering on the pickup in realignment activity in August, maybe if you could elaborate on what you thought triggered that sorting and maybe the types of accounts that, that was coming from and whether that 20% number applied in the month of August. It seemed like it was triggered by the rate hike in late July and maybe just sort of piggybacking off of Ken\u2019s question. If you could maybe just talk about how you\u2019re thinking about customer behavior as it relates to realignment in the event we see a couple of more rate hikes this cycle? Thanks.\nPeter Crawford: Sure. So yes, I don\u2019t remember \u2013 recall the exact percent of the assets that were \u2013 or purchase money fund balances that were coming from bank sweep. But I can say is August, I think there was a couple of things, there was in part a reaction to the Fed\u2019s increase in late July and some of the headlines maybe that, that captured. We also saw actually net inflows into equities. So there\u2019s definitely an investor sentiment aspect to it. In terms of going forward, I mean, our expectation is that when the Fed increases, it has a small, but decreasing and temporary impact on deposit flows. If people are yield-sensitive, the cash is yield-sensitive and Fed funds is 5.25, they\u2019ll move. It doesn\u2019t make a huge difference whether it\u2019s 5.5. I think it\u2019s more about the headlines, frankly, as that creates that may prompt some people to move. But I want to emphasize that a high-for-longer scenario is a very good scenario for Schwab for our business model. While in the near term, that rate increase can lead to a little bit more and deposit activity, that higher rate over the long term means more \u2013 a higher yield on the roughly 1/3 of our interest-earning assets that are tied to floating rates. That\u2019s things like our margin lending and the cash, the segregated cash and the cash we have at the parent, the cash we have with the bank, et cetera. So after sort of a high-for-longer scenario, which it seems to be what we\u2019re easing our way into here, it is a good scenario for us because that impact on transactional cash balances is short-lived.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS. You may go ahead.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Peter, I would appreciate if we could maybe try and square Slide 31 and where you talked about the client cash rate alignment versus when we run through the calculation for the September monthly data based on the various cash disclosures, percentage of client assets and whatnot, if I adjust out CDs and the money funds out of there so just getting what should be the bank sweep, BDA and the broker dealer cash, it looks it\u2019s down similar to a decline that we saw in July. And so how do I square that with the Slide 31? Does Slide 31 just not include the broker-dealer cash? Is that the delta? Can you help me understand that?\nJeff Edwards: Hey, Brennan, it\u2019s Jeff. I\u2019m happy to cover that off. I mean, it includes the same stuff it always has in terms of bank sweep plus broker-dealer balances S1 plus BDA. So it\u2019s the same consistent view we\u2019ve talked about. So we can take that offline and chat about any of the other items that are in there. But yes, this is a consistent view with the monthly and higher quarterly data.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Kyle Voigt with KBW. You may go ahead.\nKyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. So a question for Peter. You issued about $1 billion of CDs in September. Just given the trends that you\u2019re seeing with cash sorting, can you talk about expectations for the short-term funding mix between CDs and FHLB as we look out over the next couple of quarters? And kind of maybe within that, maybe you could kind of address how you intend to handle CD maturities going forward. And then what happens if we do see another kind of reacceleration or another blip in another month going forward, how you intend to \u2013 how would you manage through that in terms of liquidity and where you access liquidity from. Thank you.\nPeter Crawford: Sure. So I would expect that we\u2019re going to have a mix of CDs and FHLB going forward. There are advantages of each. The CDs today are a little bit lower cost, and we like the idea of paying our clients and clients of other brokers. The nice thing about the FHLB is that it\u2019s very \u2013 you can really dial in the maturity than the exact amount. You can also prepay FHLB. So if we see growth in deposits, we have the ability to prepay those FHLB advances. So I\u2019d expect it would be a mix. We like the fact of having a diversity of funding sources going forward. But I think either way, I think we\u2019d expect both of those balances collectively to trend down, as I said, over the next several quarters.\nJeff Edwards: I\u2019m going to take one question here from the console operator. This one, let\u2019s do one for Walt. Walt, obviously, since the time we had the Ameritrade approval for the deal and actually beginning the conversion was around, say, 2.5 or 3 years, this time frame is a bit longer than maybe some more other recent transactions. Could you talk a little bit about what drove that timeline?\nWalter Bettinger: Sure. Thanks, Jeff. I referenced in my prepared remarks about our best-of-both approach in which rather than following a traditional integration, which is simply moving clients and the acquired firm over to the platforms of the acquiring company, instead, we look to bring over a series of capabilities, whether it\u2019s thinkorswim that I think now is available to all Schwab clients as of today, things like iRebal and thinkpipes. But maybe even to go beyond that just quickly, every brokerage conversion that I am familiar with in the history of our industry involved simply bringing over account assets and then a limited amount of demographic data, things like address, social security numbers, things like that. We took a very different approach. In addition to bringing over the most basic information that others would always bring over, we also brought over transaction history. I think \u2013 I believe it was 4 years of history. We brought over historical documents, all of the documents that the client would have had at Ameritrade, open orders, client preferences, watch lists, things like cash sharing and move money instructions. So we just took a very different approach. And I think that, that is part of what has contributed to the extraordinarily low level of client complaints that we have seen as, again, I referenced in my prepared remarks. And so I just would roll this all back into the big picture of our through clients\u2019 eyes strategy that we\u2019ve approached this integration that these are exceptionally important clients that we look to serve for many, many years to come. And despite the environment that we happen to be in, make the right long-term decision. It\u2019s fascinating to hear all the discussion around client cash realigning because client cash realigning is cyclical, but our through clients\u2019 eyes strategy is not. And as we work our way through the very tactical issues being raised today and the near-term issues, I think the power of Schwab is going to emerge and once again, reward our clients as well as our stockholders in a manner we have many, many times in the past.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. You may go ahead.\nDaniel Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on NNA. I get the outlook and the guidance, and certainly September was improved. Can you talk about the backlog today for potential advisers and how that compares to previous periods? And then with the Ameritrade integration now mostly done, should we not anticipate much in terms of movement in NNA as a result of that? And also, if you could maybe clarify on some of those outflows, how much was Schwab\u2019s decision to walk away from that business or client decisions?\nRick Wurster: Sure, absolutely. As it relates to the backlog of advisers, we continue to see a healthy pipeline in our Advisor Services business. So no change there, very robust. And I think what we are seeing is a resumption of that activity. For a few months around the conversion, a lot of our effort and energy was put into that. A lot of advisers were holding back clients that they would have brought to Schwab because they didn\u2019t want them to have to go through a conversion, so they held on them. And now we\u2019re seeing a resumption back to all normal levels of activity. So that\u2019s on the backlog of advisers. What was the last one? Yes, let me talk about some of the attrition on our Advisor Services side. It really came from a combination of 3 things. Number one were some relationships where it just didn\u2019t fit either for economic reasons or for services that the RIA firm wanted that we weren\u2019t going to provide. Second reason, there may have been some other business reasons why it didn\u2019t make sense. It used to be an adviser maybe that we had served, and the relationship didn\u2019t make sense for us to serve in the future. So there was a chunk of relationships where it didn\u2019t make sense for both parties for us to serve them. And then there was some element of regrettable attrition, clients who would have liked to have served, but for a variety of reasons, they chose to go somewhere else. So it was a combination of those three things.\nWalter Bettinger: One of the things that\u2019s very important when we talk about NNA is we put it in the context of the $1.8 trillion of assets that are coming over as part of this acquisition. If I can remember properly from 4 years ago, we estimated something like 5% to 6% asset attrition and about 4% revenue attrition. And we are substantially outperforming those numbers. But the reality is 5% to 6% of what is now $1.8 trillion is a meaningful number. And so when you compare attrition from this acquisition and you apply it to monthly net new asset figures, you\u2019re going to get a decline in monthly numbers. It\u2019s just math. But as Rick indicated accurately, this is waning, and the RIA side was all concentrated in a couple of months before the conversion. So we feel exceptionally good about where we are. Despite the very few RIAs who Rick identified, who did choose regrettably to go somewhere else. But that was a small number overall, and a significant amount of the attrition were clients that we had previously terminated relationships with who maybe switched over to Ameritrade or as I mentioned, run a commission-oriented business that really doesn\u2019t fit with our model. We work much better with advisers who have decided to principally go fee and get largely out of the commission side.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. You may go ahead.\nSteven Chubak: Good morning. So it\u2019s certainly encouraging to see the capital build, the NNA acceleration in September. I think the one element of \u2013 area of concern for investors continues to be the sweep cash dynamics. And while bank sweep deposits increasing in September, certainly encouraging, total sweep cash was down $9 billion for the month. And Peter, you alluded to the fact that you\u2019re seeing similar trends in October versus September. How should we interpret what the total cash sweep decline will be, not exclusively the bank sweep deposits? It feels like there\u2019s some bifurcated trends between payables and bank sweep deposits. Hoping you can unpack that better.\nPeter Crawford: Yes. So thanks, Steven. So I\u2019m not sure where your $9 billion figure is coming from, but that is 2x higher than what we\u2019re tracking. If you do the math on that page where we show the daily flow, you\u2019re looking at a number that\u2019s about half that level. So I\u2019m not sure where the $9 billion is coming from, and you can maybe work that through with the IR team. The \u2013 and so October is tracking in line with that lower number. So again, it just \u2013 it reinforces the fact that we saw a decline from April to May and May to June and June to July. And then we had this one blip in August, and then September has really continued the trend. And October is consistent with September. So all this reinforces our conviction that we\u2019ve been saying for quite some time, which is this cash reallocation activity is declining. And we\u2019re seeing, again, in terms of the number of people who are reallocating and the size of those trades that they\u2019re making, so it all reinforces our conviction that we\u2019re very close to the end of this cycle.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\nAlexander Blostein: Thank you. Good morning. Just a quick question around the balance sheet again and some of the liquidity dynamics. Peter, can you just frame to us how much of securities will be maturing through the end of 2024 between available for sale and HTM buckets just to refresh on that? And then I know you made a point about long-term debt. So as you kind of work through your liquidity requirements, any incremental capital changes, how do you think the appropriate level of long-term debt for Schwab will look like by the end of \u201824?\nPeter Crawford: Yes. So in terms of \u2013 when we think about principal and interest off of the investment portfolio, it\u2019s tracking now at about $4 billion or so per month, so roughly $11 billion to $12 billion per quarter, maybe a little bit more in the next quarter, but somewhere in that range over the next 5 quarters. So that provides a meaningful amount of resources, liquidity to pay down those supplemental borrowings when you add that together with, of course, the net new assets that we attract for new accounts. That\u2019s \u2013 those are the 2 of the bigger drivers in terms of paying down those supplemental short-term borrowings. In terms of the right amount of liquidity, I would think about this in terms of parent liquidity. I mean, we raised debt to keep liquidity at the parent. We do that primarily to support the activity, our client needs at the broker-dealers. And so we have through \u2013 as we\u2019ve been going through these conversions, we have wanted to operate with a little bit more parent liquidity, given \u2013 to make sure we\u2019ve got ample resources through these conversion weekends. And so we are running with a higher level of liquidity now than we might expect to have after we pay out. And we also have the debt maturities in the early part of next year. So we want to make sure we\u2019ve got the funds necessary to pay off those maturities. So once we get done with that, we\u2019ll be comfortable with the level of liquidity that we have at the parent.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to circle back to your commentary on the Workplace business. So I was hoping you could help size the business just in terms of assets and accounts, how much does that represent? And maybe you could talk about how much that has contributed to NNA in recent years as well as some of the steps that you\u2019re thinking about taking to broaden this client acquisition funnel over the next couple of years?\nRick Wurster: I think as it relates to the steps we\u2019re taking, it\u2019s an exciting opportunity for us because it increases the top of the funnel, the amount of clients that could become future Schwab clients for us. And what we\u2019re focused on is really twofold. Increasing that top of the funnel, bringing more and more employees into the Schwab Workplace business. And then secondly, in converting them into Schwab clients. And so we have efforts going along 2 fronts. Number one, integrating the business and tying it more into Schwab. So the experience leverages all that Schwab has to offer, our retail mobile side, our retail website, our branches, all of those capabilities that we can bring to bear for the workplace clients. If we do that successfully, we\u2019ll convert a greater number of our workplace clients into long-term Schwab clients. And when we do that, as I shared earlier, they bring 4x the assets that they have through the Workplace business. And then the second thing we need to do is we need to win more of the employee-based businesses at the top of the funnel, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re investing in the experience and the technology around it. So the business has the potential, I think, to add a lot more to our NNA going forward than it does today, and we\u2019re quite excited about the prospects.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Oh, great. Thanks. A lot of my questions were asked and answered. Maybe just one on the securities portfolio, the AOCI. The improved \u2013 or the stability there. Is that entirely due to the accretion of the unrealized marks getting paid down? Or is hedging the securities portfolio playing a substantial part of that?\nPeter Crawford: Yes. No. Thanks, Brian. No, that\u2019s mostly the \u2013 or I should say that really is the impact of the accretion of those marks back to par. With the duration on our available-for-sale portfolio of just over 2 years, you\u2019re looking at roughly $600-ish million per quarter in terms of amortization. So that\u2019s \u2013 even in a flat rate scenario. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s going on there.\nJeff Edwards: And just doing a time check here, looking maybe we\u2019re up on the top of the hour here. Peter, do you want to maybe close with some of those final remarks?\nPeter Crawford: Sure. Well, thanks, everyone. Appreciate the time you spent with us this morning, and appreciate all the questions. I just want to close by picking up on some comments that Walt made at the outset. And he talked about how it\u2019s easy to focus attention on the near-term challenges we have faced. We\u2019re clearly not blind to those challenges but nor are we fazed by them. We feel a great deal of confidence in our current position, our strategy and the loyalty we have built with our clients. We feel also a great deal of optimism about the opportunities ahead of us to serve our clients even better, to continue growing, to learn from our experience this year, but also to put in the rearview mirror as we continue to deliver for our clients and our stockholders in the years ahead. Thank you very much again, and we look forward to speaking with you in January.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Crawford",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Rick. So Walt and Rick talked about how despite a difficult environment, we're continuing to earn the loyalty and trust of our clients and driving strong organic growth. The enormous progress we have made with the Ameritrade acquisition and the exciting potential that the combination presents for our clients and our stockholders, the other significant growth opportunities we're pursuing and how we're working hard to capitalize on those opportunities, continuing to invest in enhancing our platform even as we take steps to strengthen our industry-leading cost advantage. In my time today, I'll briefly review our third quarter financial performance, update our 2023 scenario and offer some early thoughts on 2024 and beyond. The important point is that in the third quarter, we saw notable improvement across several \"tactical metrics\" on which there has been a lot of focus lately. We might argue too much focus in the context of our ability to create value over time. And I'm referring specifically to the pace of client cash reallocation activity, our capital levels, the level of supplemental borrowing and the trajectory of our net interest margin. When you combine these developments with the measures Walt and Rick shared that demonstrate our strong business momentum, it reinforces our confidence in our ability to move through this part of the economic cycle as we have so many times before and emerge from this period a larger, stronger and even more resilient company. As Walt mentioned, the third quarter was a challenging one for many of our clients and for our business model. And so not surprisingly, our financial performance was off last year's record levels with a little under $5 billion of revenue and $0.77 of adjusted EPS. And yet, that bottom line performance was better than the second quarter of this year. And with an adjusted pretax margin of over 41%, 30% on a GAAP basis due to the large restructuring charge this quarter, we are navigating from a position of strength. Turning our attention to the balance sheet. Bank deposits were down 7% sequentially due to client cash allocation decisions. But following a brief uptick in that activity in August, the pace slowed dramatically in September. As a result of that slowing activity, we were able to further reduce the amount of supplemental funding we have outstanding. We issued a little over $2 billion in debt to supplement our parent liquidity. And assuming the markets continue to be constructive, we will likely issue a bit more debt primarily to build up extra liquidity ahead of some debt maturities we have early next year. And our capital position continues to get even stronger with our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio rising to 8.2%. And our adjusted Tier 1 leverage ratio, inclusive of AOCI and therefore, what our binding constraint would be if we lose the AOCI opt-out at Schwab Bank now into the mid-4% range, and that's using average assets, it's more like 4.6% today on a spot basis, as it steadily climbs towards 5% by the end of the year, meaning that we will be in a position to meet the newly proposed regulatory requirement organically and several years ahead of the anticipated full implementation date. I know there's a lot of commentary. There has been a lot of commentary about the increased client cash allocation activity in August, activity which seemed to buck the clear trend of deceleration we've been experiencing over the previous several months. We said at the time that it felt more like an anomaly. And now having closed the books on September, we have a number of tangible proof points that indicate that outflows are easing, and we're getting closer to the return of sweep cash growth, including the fact that the overall pace of realignment activity decelerated in September to the lowest level we have seen during the current cycle. We experienced our first month of bank sweep deposit growth since before the hiking cycle started. And both the absolute number and size of client realignment events dropped further from the level we shared last quarter. And all this in spite of an increase in rates across the curve. And while we saw increased flows into purchase money funds, we caution you again not to use those daily flow numbers as a proxy for overall deposit flows. Only around 20% of the purchase money fund purchases lately have been funded with bank sweep in Schwab One with the remainder coming from equities, fixed income or oftentimes money coming from outside Schwab that's been attracted by our very competitive yields and low expense ratios on those funds. And now we're now halfway through October, and the trend has largely continued with overall transactional cash balances, including again Schwab One and the IDA in line with the September trend despite delayed tax payments by many of our clients in California and elsewhere. As we have said many times, that trend is not surprising, but it is encouraging. And it brings greater clarity towards our core earnings power. During Walt and Rick's sections, they talk about some of the measures that demonstrate how we're continuing to win with clients, metrics such as client promoter score, net new assets, new accounts and our organic growth rate, the deal-related attrition that has been lower than our initial expectations and advice flows. And those are clearly the most important predictors of our long-term success, and all portend a bright future. But the more tactical balance sheet metrics have all trended in a positive direction as well. And we believe we are well on our way towards those indicators returning to more normal levels. The level of supplemental borrowing has continued to fall as the ongoing cash flow generated from our investment portfolio has been more than sufficient to support the slowing deposit bank sweep outflows. And we'd expect this level of temporary borrowing to drop substantially over the next handful of quarters, paving the way for us to resume reinvestment activity in 2025, which, assuming rates follow expectations, will provide a meaningful boost to our net interest margin. Speaking of net interest margin, assuming rates followed the dot plot, we still anticipate it building through 2024 and approaching 3% by the end of 2025. Despite rising interest rates, our adjusted Tier 1 leverage ratio at the banks and for the consolidated corporation rose roughly 40 basis points during the quarter, approaching the level to be considered well capitalized several years before that measure is slated to become our regulatory ratio. And we'd expect those ratios to continue to increase due to continued strong capital formation, the accretion of the unrealized marks back to equity and a reduction of our balance sheet as we pay off the remaining supplemental borrowings, bringing back the potential for opportunistic capital return over time. So what does all this mean for the rest of this year and 2024? Our outlook for this year is pretty similar to what we shared back in July. As client cash allocation activity continues to abate, we still expect to see a return of transactional cash growth later this year. We should see a stabilization of revenue and then a resumption of growth over time and full year 2023 revenue is expected to decline a bit more than the previously mentioned 7% to 8% range. So ultimately, trading volumes and market levels will influence how things shake out. On the expense side, we still expect our 2023 adjusted expense growth to be somewhere in the 6-ish percent range, inclusive of the $160 million onetime FDIC charge that, of course, was not contemplated when we set out our initial spending plan at the beginning of the year, meaning that our other spending is tracking at least 300 basis points below the range we communicated back in January, as we adjust and optimize our expense base consistent with Rick's earlier comments. Now turning our attention to 2024. We'll share specific scenarios at our winter business update. But needless to say, the revenue outlook will be shaped by a range of factors, including, of course, path of interest rates in the equity markets, the pace of deposit growth and the level of client engagement. But our expectation is it will make substantial progress in reducing our usage of FHLB advances in CDs. Rick described the work we're doing on the expense front, and we'd expect that to result in 2024 adjusted expenses that are no higher than 2023. And finally, we'd expect to continue to grow both our regulatory capital ratios and our adjusted Tier 1 leverage ratio, boosting that lateral ratio back above 6.5%, several years before it becomes a formal requirement. There is no doubt that we have been navigating through a difficult environment, but it should be apparent that the core pillars of the multi-decade investment thesis for Schwab are as strong today as ever. We are the premier asset gatherer with industry-leading client loyalty, a strong competitive moat and a leadership position in the 2 fastest-growing segments within wealth management. We have multiple ways to convert that asset growth into revenue growth, including growing advice with both Schwab and Ameritrade clients as well as a long-term NIM tailwind as we eventually reinvest our securities portfolio at much higher prevailing rates. We continue to manage expenses with discipline with $1 billion or more of remaining expense synergies and other efficiency opportunities. And we are a company that has shown the ability to couple strong organic growth with opportunistic capital return, a combination which we're confident will reemerge in the years ahead. Now admittedly, that powerful combination has been obscured recently by some of the fog as Walt described it back in July, but this fog continues to clear with deal-related attrition abating, allowing our net new assets to return to our normal levels, which are anything but, client cash allocation activity slowing, supplemental borrowing decreasing and our NIM rebounding, expense growth slowing and poised to slow further as we prepare for the significant remaining expense actions in the quarters ahead and our capital levels building despite the headwinds posed by increasing rates. I talked earlier about long-term predictors of success versus more tactical near-term metrics. But when you step back to look at the whole picture, you see a healthy, resilient company with a lot of momentum and a lot of opportunity in front of that. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff to facilitate our Q&A. Thanks, Ken, for the question. So our expectation is that we will continue to prioritize paying down the supplemental borrowings. That is the fastest way to get to that 3% NIM that we talked about by the end of 2025. So what that could mean is that we could be seeing deposits grow, transactional cash grow even as interest-earning assets are declining because our focus is really on paying down those supplemental borrowings. So that would be \u2013 you could see a scenario where interest-bearing assets are declining, but NIM is growing and actually net interest revenue is growing even as that is happening. Sure. So yes, I don't remember \u2013 recall the exact percent of the assets that were \u2013 or purchase money fund balances that were coming from bank sweep. But I can say is August, I think there was a couple of things, there was in part a reaction to the Fed's increase in late July and some of the headlines maybe that, that captured. We also saw actually net inflows into equities. So there's definitely an investor sentiment aspect to it. In terms of going forward, I mean, our expectation is that when the Fed increases, it has a small, but decreasing and temporary impact on deposit flows. If people are yield-sensitive, the cash is yield-sensitive and Fed funds is 5.25, they'll move. It doesn't make a huge difference whether it's 5.5. I think it's more about the headlines, frankly, as that creates that may prompt some people to move. But I want to emphasize that a high-for-longer scenario is a very good scenario for Schwab for our business model. While in the near term, that rate increase can lead to a little bit more and deposit activity, that higher rate over the long term means more \u2013 a higher yield on the roughly 1/3 of our interest-earning assets that are tied to floating rates. That's things like our margin lending and the cash, the segregated cash and the cash we have at the parent, the cash we have with the bank, et cetera. So after sort of a high-for-longer scenario, which it seems to be what we're easing our way into here, it is a good scenario for us because that impact on transactional cash balances is short-lived. Sure. So I would expect that we're going to have a mix of CDs and FHLB going forward. There are advantages of each. The CDs today are a little bit lower cost, and we like the idea of paying our clients and clients of other brokers. The nice thing about the FHLB is that it's very \u2013 you can really dial in the maturity than the exact amount. You can also prepay FHLB. So if we see growth in deposits, we have the ability to prepay those FHLB advances. So I'd expect it would be a mix. We like the fact of having a diversity of funding sources going forward. But I think either way, I think we'd expect both of those balances collectively to trend down, as I said, over the next several quarters. Yes. So thanks, Steven. So I'm not sure where your $9 billion figure is coming from, but that is 2x higher than what we're tracking. If you do the math on that page where we show the daily flow, you're looking at a number that's about half that level. So I'm not sure where the $9 billion is coming from, and you can maybe work that through with the IR team. The \u2013 and so October is tracking in line with that lower number. So again, it just \u2013 it reinforces the fact that we saw a decline from April to May and May to June and June to July. And then we had this one blip in August, and then September has really continued the trend. And October is consistent with September. So all this reinforces our conviction that we've been saying for quite some time, which is this cash reallocation activity is declining. And we're seeing, again, in terms of the number of people who are reallocating and the size of those trades that they're making, so it all reinforces our conviction that we're very close to the end of this cycle. Yes. So in terms of \u2013 when we think about principal and interest off of the investment portfolio, it's tracking now at about $4 billion or so per month, so roughly $11 billion to $12 billion per quarter, maybe a little bit more in the next quarter, but somewhere in that range over the next 5 quarters. So that provides a meaningful amount of resources, liquidity to pay down those supplemental borrowings when you add that together with, of course, the net new assets that we attract for new accounts. That's \u2013 those are the 2 of the bigger drivers in terms of paying down those supplemental short-term borrowings. In terms of the right amount of liquidity, I would think about this in terms of parent liquidity. I mean, we raised debt to keep liquidity at the parent. We do that primarily to support the activity, our client needs at the broker-dealers. And so we have through \u2013 as we've been going through these conversions, we have wanted to operate with a little bit more parent liquidity, given \u2013 to make sure we've got ample resources through these conversion weekends. And so we are running with a higher level of liquidity now than we might expect to have after we pay out. And we also have the debt maturities in the early part of next year. So we want to make sure we've got the funds necessary to pay off those maturities. So once we get done with that, we'll be comfortable with the level of liquidity that we have at the parent. Yes. No. Thanks, Brian. No, that's mostly the \u2013 or I should say that really is the impact of the accretion of those marks back to par. With the duration on our available-for-sale portfolio of just over 2 years, you're looking at roughly $600-ish million per quarter in terms of amortization. So that's \u2013 even in a flat rate scenario. So that's really what's going on there. Sure. Well, thanks, everyone. Appreciate the time you spent with us this morning, and appreciate all the questions. I just want to close by picking up on some comments that Walt made at the outset.

            "name": "Rick Wurster",
            "content": "Thank you, Walt, and good morning, everyone. I want to spend our time today talking about how we've driven 5% to 7% organic growth historically and how we plan to drive it in the future through our model of generating 3% to 5% of NNA growth from our existing clients and 2% to 3% of growth from new clients and a return on our strategic focus areas. Our through clients' eyes strategy has allowed us to generate 3% to 5% growth from existing clients. When clients turn to Schwab, they know they will get industry-leading value, exceptional service and transparency in every interaction they have. By treating clients the way they want to be treated, we build trust, and we're able to deepen relationships and capture a greater share of wallet. You see this in the 51.2 billion in year-to-date NNA we see from existing retail clients and the 43.4 billion in year-to-date NNA we see from existing adviser clients. We have also been able to consistently drive 2% to 3% asset growth from new clients. This is due in part to our diversified acquisition model, which includes leveraging the strong personal relationships created by our branch footprint and our RIA service model, earning referrals from our delighted clients and deploying data-driven marketing campaigns and investing in complementary acquisition channels, including our workplace business, which I'll talk more about shortly. Year-to-date, this has driven 744,000 new-to-firm households to our retail business, approximately 60% of whom are under age 40 and approximately 240 adviser and transition teams. The third part of our growth recipe is our continued investment in our strategic focus areas. I'll start today with scale and efficiency. We shared with you in July that we are taking steps to enhance our flexibility and efficiency with an annual run rate expense savings target of $1 billion plus. Walt spoke earlier about our Ameritrade integration, and one component of our expense savings will come from capturing $500 million in remaining Ameritrade expense synergies. Another $500 million plus in annual savings will come from streamlining our operating model, which includes eliminating positions from predominantly non-client-facing areas and reducing our real estate footprint. As we previously shared, these actions are expected to result in a non-GAAP expense charge of $400 million to $500 million, a portion of which you saw in our results this morning, with the remainder to follow either later this year or in 2024. With these actions, we expect year-over-year expense growth to be roughly flat even while we continue to invest aggressively in client products and service. It's this investment that leads to the win-win monetization I'll talk about now. One area we are investing in and one I've discussed in this forum several times as well. I've said it before, there is a bull market for advice. Today, we have approximately $530 billion in retail assets receiving ongoing advisory services. Not only do these clients see Schwab as a place to get advice, but our advice offers have among the highest client promoter scores across all of Schwab. With the investments we've made and continue to make, more and more of our retail clients are turning to us for wealth management as they move into a life phase where they need advice. You can see this in our managed investing flows, where we've seen year-to-date record highs in Schwab Wealth Advisory, Wasmer Schroeder and Schwab Personalized Indexing. Year-to-date, net flows in the Schwab Wealth Advisory are a record $9.2 billion, up nearly 60% over last year. The third quarter was also a record quarter for Schwab Wealth Advisory with $3.3 billion in flows coming into our flagship wealth solution. Year-to-date net flows in the Wasmer Schroeder are a record $4.5 billion, up nearly 130% over last year. While we believe we are still in the early days, clients and FCs are starting to learn about the potential benefits of direct indexing, and the combination of tax benefits and personalization are attractive to them. Lending is also an increasingly important part of the wealth management relationship, and we've recently launched a fully digital onboarding experience that lets advisers access a Pledged Asset Line or a PAL for their clients. The new PAL process reduced the time to submit a PAL application to just minutes and enables clients to be approved in just one to two days. Growing PAL is a win-win opportunity. It's good for the adviser because it helps them retain assets and compete with banks. And it's good for Schwab because of the positive spread to securities. Now I'll turn to another area where we have a win-win monetization opportunity, and that's our Workplace business. Our Workplace business meets the needs of individuals who become investors through their employers and includes our retirement plan business and our stock plan business, among others. This business is strategic as it allows us to introduce millions of workplace participants to Schwab, many of whom are investing for the very first time, finding us with a pipeline of future retail and adviser services clients. Workplace connects more than 5,500 employers, 2,700 advisory firms and 2.5 million investor households to Greater Schwab. In fact, today, 1 in 3 new-to-firm households at Schwab are originated through our Workplace business. We retained 50% of eligible rollover retirement assets, and our stock plan business contributes about 10% to retail NNA. And finally, nearly 20% of Workplace households have a broader relationship with Schwab. And when they do, they have 4x the assets through those relationships. With Workplace, we have an opportunity to fuel NNA growth for Schwab into the future through our grow, retain and extend approach. To do this, we are making investments to more fully upgrade our workplace digital experiences so participants can benefit from all we have to offer on schwab.com, mobile and with our broader retail offer. And we're investing in our technology. This will require a multiyear investment, and we'll provide a deeper dive and more specifics about this opportunity at future updates. I'll turn now to our third strategic focus area, client segmentation. Last quarter, I talked about our two new branded client experiences within retail, Schwab Private Client Services and Schwab Private Wealth Services for our 1 million-plus and 10 million-plus clients, respectively. This is all about delivering differentiated experiences across relationship, service, operations, product and price. The launch has been very well received by our clients. This quarter, I'll talk more about our trader offer. Traders are one of our most highly engaged client segments. On average, compared to non-trader retail clients, they bring in 6.5x the NNA and have 3.8x the household assets and generate 2.8x higher ROCA. We're continuing to invest in this offer to provide the world-class trading experience, traders expect. Just today, we launched our reimagined trader offer, Schwab Trading powered by Ameritrade. With this new experience, we're combining the best of Schwab and Ameritrade by giving all of our clients access to the thinkorswim and Schwab trading platforms, unparalleled trading education, including many elements of Ameritrade's trader education offer and specialized service. Traders at Schwab have access to all that Schwab has to offer, wealth management, banking and more. In fact, our virtual active trader branch includes active trader financial consultants, who focus on both trader coaching and wealth management to help meet the unique needs of qualifying traders. We think this offer sets the bar for what a trading experience should be. Putting it all together, with our through clients' eyes strategy, we are well positioned to consistently generate 5% to 7% organic growth from both existing and new clients. And there is an opportunity ahead as we start to see returns on the investments we've made in our strategic focus areas. As we've shared in prior quarters, we have an opportunity to close the share of wallet gap between Ameritrade and Schwab clients. And we have an attractive opportunity to delight our retail clients with our wealth management and to delight both our retail and adviser clients with our lending offerings, while growing our revenue. And I'll wrap up where Walt started. Our relentless focus on serving our clients' needs creates a clear path to organic growth and delivering long-term value to our clients and stockholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Peter. Sure, absolutely. As it relates to the backlog of advisers, we continue to see a healthy pipeline in our Advisor Services business. So no change there, very robust. And I think what we are seeing is a resumption of that activity. For a few months around the conversion, a lot of our effort and energy was put into that. A lot of advisers were holding back clients that they would have brought to Schwab because they didn't want them to have to go through a conversion, so they held on them. And now we're seeing a resumption back to all normal levels of activity. So that's on the backlog of advisers. What was the last one? Yes, let me talk about some of the attrition on our Advisor Services side. It really came from a combination of 3 things. Number one were some relationships where it just didn't fit either for economic reasons or for services that the RIA firm wanted that we weren't going to provide. Second reason, there may have been some other business reasons why it didn't make sense. It used to be an adviser maybe that we had served, and the relationship didn't make sense for us to serve in the future. So there was a chunk of relationships where it didn't make sense for both parties for us to serve them. And then there was some element of regrettable attrition, clients who would have liked to have served, but for a variety of reasons, they chose to go somewhere else. So it was a combination of those three things. I think as it relates to the steps we're taking, it's an exciting opportunity for us because it increases the top of the funnel, the amount of clients that could become future Schwab clients for us. And what we're focused on is really twofold. Increasing that top of the funnel, bringing more and more employees into the Schwab Workplace business. And then secondly, in converting them into Schwab clients. And so we have efforts going along 2 fronts. Number one, integrating the business and tying it more into Schwab. So the experience leverages all that Schwab has to offer, our retail mobile side, our retail website, our branches, all of those capabilities that we can bring to bear for the workplace clients. If we do that successfully, we'll convert a greater number of our workplace clients into long-term Schwab clients. And when we do that, as I shared earlier, they bring 4x the assets that they have through the Workplace business. And then the second thing we need to do is we need to win more of the employee-based businesses at the top of the funnel, and that's why we're investing in the experience and the technology around it. So the business has the potential, I think, to add a lot more to our NNA going forward than it does today, and we're quite excited about the prospects."

            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our October business update. Rick, Peter and I are excited to share good news with you as we review our third quarter. You'll hear about our tremendous progress in the conversion of former Ameritrade clients over to Schwab, our ongoing success serving clients and gathering assets, the significant opportunity for ongoing organic growth and marked improvement in some of the key indicators that have attracted outsized attention recently, including the pace of client cash realignment. But maybe most importantly, you'll hear about the consistency of our strategy, our ideal positioning in the fastest-growing segments of the investment services industry, our ever strengthening position as the low-cost provider, the world-class trust and confidence our clients place in us, our superior pretax profit margins even during one of the most difficult environments possible for our financial model and our commitment to disciplined ongoing investments designed to drive organic growth for many years to come. Now certainly, I understand that the overall backdrop of the environment today is decidedly negative. And I understand that for some, it might be easier to look at the near-term challenges we face at Schwab. I encourage you to consider the entirety of our position and the potential it creates for the future. So the actions of the Federal Reserve to recover from their mistaken transitory inflation viewpoint continue to reverberate across the financial markets. These actions are slowing the rate of inflation, but at a significant cost to the markets, to consumers, to investors and to firms like Schwab. While short-term interest rates continued to rise over the past year, longer-term rates are now also rising. During the third quarter, investors began to feel this pain. They acknowledge it as investor sentiment plunged during the quarter, moving down into bear market sentiment. First, it's not surprising as both equity and fixed income markets continue to suffer. Cash was virtually the only safe place to invest. An interesting perspective as at Schwab, we have always believed that cash should be a key part of every investor's long-term investment portfolio. I think it's particularly important to look at the chart on the bottom of this slide and place ourselves in the minds of investors, who viewed their bonds as conservative ballast against the expected volatility of equity markets. Even those who maintained shorter bond holdings of two to five years have seen substantial declines in their assets between 7% and 13%. Again, truly, there have been a few places for investors to go in recent times to avoid losses other than in cash. And of course, at Schwab, we've been similarly impacted by falling bond prices and a rush to cash investments. But throughout this period, our clients have continued to trust us, continue to be loyal and continue to recommend Schwab as a place for their friends and family to invest. And third parties clearly feel the same way with Schwab Bank recently named, by a wide margin incidentally, the most trusted bank in the industry by Investor's Business Daily. And Schwab was ranked by J.D. Power as number one in investor satisfaction among full-service wealth management firms. I share these third-party endorsements, not because we place undue weight on them, but as a reminder that our strong client positioning contributes to our optimism for ongoing organic growth. And the metrics back this up. Year-to-date, we've captured approximately $230 billion in core net new assets and opened well over 2 million new brokerage accounts. Of course, these firm-wide new asset figures reflect the expected attrition from the integration of Ameritrade clients. And of course, the July and August net new asset figures were impacted as some of the 7,000 RIA firms from Ameritrade opted to find alternative custodians ahead of our Labor Day conversion by either their decision or in cases, by ours. And while this attrition weighed on our net new assets for those two months, it was less than what we had allowed for in our original deal-related modeling, and it has largely passed. Looking only at clients who originally opened their accounts at Schwab, we've captured approximately $250 billion in core net new assets year-to-date, an increase of about 12% year-over-year, again, illustrating the strength of the business. And that works out to an over 6% organic growth rate. So let me pivot here for a few moments, speak more in depth about the Ameritrade acquisition and progress on our integration efforts. We announced the deal in late 2019, merely a few months before the COVID pandemic hit. At the time of that deal announcement, Ameritrade had approximately $1.3 trillion in client assets, 12 million client brokerage accounts and was processing about 1.3 million trades per day. By the time we got to year-end 2022, these figures had grown substantially to approximately $1.8 trillion in client assets, 16.6 million client brokerage accounts and amazingly, about 3.6 million trades per day. Now from the day the deal was approved by stockholders and regulators, we began an integration process that we referred to as best of both. It means that unlike in most acquisitions where the acquired firm's clients are merely ported over to the acquiring firm's platforms, we instead carefully evaluated the capabilities of both firms and build capabilities that would maintain and leverage the best of both firms' services and platforms. This approach was consistent with our through clients' eyes strategy. And we believe it also sets up the combined firm in an ideal position for long-term organic growth after the integration is complete. So where are we today? We've completed 3 of 5 total transition groups. These groups make up about 80% of the total Ameritrade retail clients and 100% of the RIA firms who previously custodied their client assets with Ameritrade. To date, we've executed this integration level of accuracy and service that I have not previously seen in any conversion. During the three conversions to date, our speed to answer client phone calls has averaged less than one minute. And with our largest conversion over the Labor Day weekend now completed, we are averaging 45 complaints for 1 million of converted accounts. I just want to reemphasize that. 45 complaints for 1 million of converted accounts. Just to put that into context, client escalations during the meme stock activity in early 2021, there were approximately 200 escalations for 1 million accounts. Now clearly, there is an adjustment period for some of our clients as they familiarize themselves with new processes, new websites, new mobile apps, and we continue to make enhancements in every one of these areas. Now the work is far from done. But even the most negative observers have acknowledged the skill and attention to detail that is going into our integration efforts, and clients are responding. Former Ameritrade retail clients are rewarding us with levels of loyalty and retention that are far better than we anticipated when we announced the acquisition back in 2019. And similarly, attrition from former Ameritrade RIA custodial clients is also below our estimates, even taking into consideration the substantial amount of assets that we actively moved away from because we felt these firms did not either fit our risk profile at Schwab or who would be better served by converting to an alternative custodian, given the RIA firm's emphasis on maintaining a substantial sales commission-driven business model. And as we've communicated, almost all RIA attrition occurs before the conversion date because the firm considering leaving Schwab would not want their employees and clients to learn our new processes and technology only to switch to a different custodian and have to relearn all new processes and technology at that new custodian. We carefully tracked all RIA firms and their engagement with the many seminars and planning events that we offered prior to the conversion weekend. And not surprisingly, those firms who took advantage of these programs, which make up the majority of the client assets, have had the smoothest pass \u2013 path to conversion. And lastly, the vast majority of active former Ameritrade RIA firms are operating their businesses, placing trades and already opening new accounts on the Schwab platform. Where RIA firms have offered us suggestions for enhancements and improvements, we're fast at work making these, and we're grateful to the firms for their ideas. When we complete the final two transition groups, we are confident that we will have the broadest, most robust offering in investment services for individual investors and the advisers who serve them from industry-leading advisory solutions to world-class trading platforms, banking solutions at exceptional pricing, award-winning digital content and investor education, including the newly renamed Schwab Network, 24/7, 365 phone service combined with almost 400 branches for in-person planning and service, value pricing that is supported by what we believe is the lowest cost structure in the industry and a rich history of client-benefiting disruption. Rick, before I turn it over to you, I want to take a moment to review a slide that I've shared in the past. Despite the environment, despite the noise, we are supremely confident in our positioning for long-term growth. As we mentioned earlier, we are ideally positioned among the fastest-growing segments of investment services. Our competitive advantages are unmatched, and our current domestic market share is modest at approximately 12%. I truly believe the opportunity before us is quite bright. Rick? Sure. Thanks, Jeff. I referenced in my prepared remarks about our best-of-both approach in which rather than following a traditional integration, which is simply moving clients and the acquired firm over to the platforms of the acquiring company, instead, we look to bring over a series of capabilities, whether it's thinkorswim that I think now is available to all Schwab clients as of today, things like iRebal and thinkpipes. But maybe even to go beyond that just quickly, every brokerage conversion that I am familiar with in the history of our industry involved simply bringing over account assets and then a limited amount of demographic data, things like address, social security numbers, things like that. We took a very different approach. In addition to bringing over the most basic information that others would always bring over, we also brought over transaction history. I think \u2013 I believe it was 4 years of history. We brought over historical documents, all of the documents that the client would have had at Ameritrade, open orders, client preferences, watch lists, things like cash sharing and move money instructions. So we just took a very different approach. And I think that, that is part of what has contributed to the extraordinarily low level of client complaints that we have seen as, again, I referenced in my prepared remarks. And so I just would roll this all back into the big picture of our through clients' eyes strategy that we've approached this integration that these are exceptionally important clients that we look to serve for many, many years to come. And despite the environment that we happen to be in, make the right long-term decision. It's fascinating to hear all the discussion around client cash realigning because client cash realigning is cyclical, but our through clients' eyes strategy is not. And as we work our way through the very tactical issues being raised today and the near-term issues, I think the power of Schwab is going to emerge and once again, reward our clients as well as our stockholders in a manner we have many, many times in the past. One of the things that's very important when we talk about NNA is we put it in the context of the $1.8 trillion of assets that are coming over as part of this acquisition. If I can remember properly from 4 years ago, we estimated something like 5% to 6% asset attrition and about 4% revenue attrition. And we are substantially outperforming those numbers. But the reality is 5% to 6% of what is now $1.8 trillion is a meaningful number. And so when you compare attrition from this acquisition and you apply it to monthly net new asset figures, you're going to get a decline in monthly numbers. It's just math. But as Rick indicated accurately, this is waning, and the RIA side was all concentrated in a couple of months before the conversion. So we feel exceptionally good about where we are. Despite the very few RIAs who Rick identified, who did choose regrettably to go somewhere else. But that was a small number overall, and a significant amount of the attrition were clients that we had previously terminated relationships with who maybe switched over to Ameritrade or as I mentioned, run a commission-oriented business that really doesn't fit with our model. We work much better with advisers who have decided to principally go fee and get largely out of the commission side."

We certainly weren't going to let a little searing Texas heatwave get in the way of providing you with a strategic update on our business. This is Jeff Edwards, Head of Investor Relations, and I'll be followed very shortly by our esteemed presenters, Co-Chairman and CEO, Walt Bettinger; President, Rick Wurster and CFO, Peter Crawford. Before we kick off, let's briefly hit on a few housekeeping items.  Similar to past events I'll be helping facilitate Q&A, and we are still abiding by the one question, no follow-up format. We also ask that you save any clarifying or reconciling questions regarding this morning's reported quarter for the IR team. Today's slides will be posted to the IR website at the beginning of Peter's remarks. Okay. Before we get on to the interesting stuff, let's stop by everyone's favorite slide, our forward-looking statements page, which reminds us all that the future is inherently uncertain, so please stay up-to-date with our disclosures. And with that, Walt, please take it away.\nWalt Bettinger: Thank you, Jeff. And good morning, everyone. I'm looking forward to another triple-digit day here in Texas. It's a beautiful day, but it definitely will be a scorcher. A number of years ago, I used an illustration that seems timely to resurrect. When my office used to be in downtown San Francisco, I would often look out toward Treasure Island early in the morning only to see dense fog. And the fog would not only mask the beauty of Treasure Island, it would often be so dense that you couldn't even see the island out in the Bay. In fact, if you didn't know it was there, you might not even realize Treasure Island even existed. In some ways, it seems to me that the fog has settled in again, just as it did a few years ago, and that fog is clouding how some see Charles Schwab today. Years ago, the fog represented the extended period of ZIRP. Or 0 interest rates. Today, the fog represents the short-term challenges brought on by the near record pace of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve. But as we all know, the fog clouding Treasure Island ultimately lifts and the beauty of Treasure Island becomes clear. And of course, Treasure Island represents Charles Schwab.  Some look at the fog and only see fog. Some look at the fog and know what is temporarily hidden by it and recognize how that fog is currently masking the extraordinary progress we are making as a firm. Those who know what is hidden by the fog recognize our ongoing organic growth and market share gains, successful execution and integration of the largest brokerage combination in history.  Ideal positioning with leadership positions in the two fastest-growing areas of investment services, that's serving registered investment advisors and serving independent minded [technical difficulty] -- the low-cost provider today and poised to widen this advantage over the next 18 to 24 months, and exceptional profitability even in the most challenging of times. Today's presentations and discussions are intended to help more people understand the fog as well as what is hidden by the fog. So thanks a lot for following along. Although still somewhat uneven, the second quarter began to show some signs of an improving economic and investing environment. Inflation began to moderate and while the Fed paused its record pace of interest rates at -- interest rate increases, at least for the month of June.  As equity market volatility fell, overall equity markets performed reasonably well, but it was an exceptionally narrow market with just a handful or two of large-cap growth companies accounting for a significant percentage of the solid performance. Investors took note, and as you can see, investor sentiment turned positive by the end of the quarter. Our investor clients remained relatively active in the markets, making over five million trades per day and with purchases exceeding sales by about 20%. Year-to-date, our clients have entrusted us with over $180 billion in net new assets, a strong number given the tax month of April falls in the first half of the year. And a level of net new assets consistent with our long-term historical trend of net new assets between 5% and 7% of our total asset base. In addition, clients have opened approximately two million new accounts year-to-date.  Key client metrics continue to be solid. In retail, our speed to answer phone calls averaged under 20 seconds, and this is a particularly important metric as we transitioned millions of former Ameritrade clients over to Schwab during the first half of the year. Advisory flows in retail were also solid at over $13 billion. In Advisor Services, we continue to be the destination of choice for breakaway brokers and broker teams of all sizes. Year-to-date, we've assisted almost 160 teams moving over to independents with Schwab as their primary custodian and the average advisor manages about $90 million who converted to independents.  Of course, these near-term metrics are important, but the long-term success of Schwab is even more important and revealing. We have a distinctive set of competitive advantages built over multiple decades that enable us to serve clients in a better way, while at the same time, rewarding our stockholders.  Our advantages revolve around our size and scale, our operating efficiency, service culture, operating structure, reputation and willingness to be disruptive. These six advantages help us to execute on our Through Clients' Eyes strategy, which has resulted in a dramatic increase in market share over the past decade, as we've meaningfully grown our market share of client assets by multiples of our key competitors at independent broker-dealers as well as wirehouses. And this change in market share is more than simply numbers on a page. It represents millions of clients and hundreds of billions of dollars of client assets proactively choosing Schwab and in doing so, getting a better deal than what they traditionally experienced.  And while our scale and efficiency has positioned us as the low-cost provider for many years, we are ready to widen that gap meaningfully in the next 18 months. As we reap the efficiency and automation benefits of the Ameritrade integration. We anticipate the realization of expense savings to be substantial. In addition to the remaining $500 million of synergy savings that we originally committed to as part of the Ameritrade acquisition, we now anticipate achieving at least an additional $500 million in future expense savings. These savings will come from a variety of areas, real estate savings, lower headcount from efficiencies gained via automation built and implemented as part of the integration work, streamlining our organization to ensure we are set up to operate most efficiently post integration. And the removal of temporary expenses that were associated with the integration that we added to ensure a smooth and thoughtful process for our clients. Now Rick, before I turn it over to you to discuss in more depth where we stand with our integration process and the ongoing success we're seeing with existing clients and new prospects, I wanted to simply reinforce the strength of our firm. The successful track record we have built up over decades continues. The competitive advantages we have built, continue. And I'm quite confident that the fog temporarily shrouding our firm will lift and sunny days will return in the coming quarters.  Rick?\nRick Wurster: Thank you, Walt, and hello, everyone. Our efforts remain squarely focused on our three strategic areas, scale and efficiency, win-win monetization and client segmentation. In our time today, I'll highlight the progress we've made in each focus area and talk through the opportunities that we see ahead. Starting with scale and efficiency, integration has been and remains our number one priority. Over Memorial Day weekend, we completed the largest brokerage conversion in the industry, moving more than five million client accounts from Ameritrade to Schwab.  Thanks to the dedication of an incredible team. The conversion was a success. No material issues occurred despite the fact we migrated 11 times more clients than our previous February conversion weekend. Client engagement has been strong with 1.3 million clients logging into Schwab within the first week following the conversion weekend.  In fact, Schwab's second largest market open occurred with no issues on a Tuesday immediately following Memorial Day. And by the end of the day on that Tuesday, our service levels had returned to normal, with us answering calls at an average of seven seconds just a day after the conversion.  More broadly, client and asset attrition within our conversion groups have been below expectations. While we are still in the middle of what has been a successful client conversion, we remain laser-focused on seeing it through to completion in the months ahead. We are on track to migrate the remaining Ameritrade clients in three additional transition groups in September, November and in the first half of 2024. One of the exciting parts of our conversion is the combined capabilities for our clients, whether they are a retail client or an advisor client. And I'd like to start by sharing the benefits on the retail side. We have invested in our web and mobile experiences at Schwab to ensure we have the best of the features and functionalities of both firms. Our former Ameritrade clients will have access to the full spectrum of portfolio and wealth management solutions that we have had at Schwab. Ameritrade clients will also be able to access our banking capabilities, our branch network experience and our exceptional client service. The branch network experience includes providing access to planning and wealth management capabilities that were not a focus of Ameritrade. We believe that will help Ameritrade clients consolidate at Schwab rather than rely upon a second firm.  Now let me discuss the benefits to Schwab's retail clients. One of the biggest enhancements for existing Schwab clients will come when we make thinkorswim available to them later this year. Thinkorswim is one of the crown jewels of Ameritrade. And it's widely considered to be the premier trading platform in the market today, with its unique combination of powerful tools and dedicated service from experienced trading professionals alongside education, for all levels of experience. And all retail clients will have this at our competitive pricing representing our true no trade-offs approach.  The same is true for our RIA clients. Ameritrade advisors will migrate to Schwab over the September conversion weekend, but they already have access to meaningful aspects of our RIA experience. Ameritrade advisors already participate in our flagship industry events, including IMPACT. They've started to benefit from our leading business consulting offer, including participating in our annual benchmarking study and the executive leadership program.  And we've included them in our RIA industry advocacy programs while also giving them access to resources like our strategy desk which educates advisors on how to use various option strategies through one-on-one consultations as well as our block desk, which helps advisors to optimize their best execution process. And as we look to Labor Day weekend, preparations for conversion are well underway and advisors are engaged. 80% of firms who only custody with Ameritrade have already begun to credentialize themselves. Over 20,000 Veo One users have accessed Schwab Advisor Center to test drive our platform.  Over 5,000 firms to date have attended at least one educational webinar session. And we are spending this summer helping firms get familiar with our technology, our investment offerings and our people, so they are ready to do business at Schwab after Labor Day weekend. And after conversion, all advisors will enjoy the full benefits of our combined offer, a custodial platform that is designed to help RIAs of all sizes grow and succeed. Schwab advisers will benefit from award-winning platforms and capabilities like thinkpipes, iRebal and for Model Market Center technology. And Schwab Advisor Center will incorporate Veo One\u2019s most popular features and functionality. Ameritrade advisors will have access to the breadth of Schwab's offer, including Schwab Charitable and Schwab Bank. We believe there will never have been a stronger custodial offer in the market than coming out of the conversion weekend. Turning now to win-win monetization. Clients are continuing to come to Schwab for advice and we've seen strong flows in our full-service wealth programs and our managed investing solutions. Schwab Wealth Advisory had $5.9 billion in net flows for the first half of 2023 and an increase of 89% compared to last year. And notably, some of these inflows are being driven by a meaningful increase in flows from existing advisory clients, which combined with a strong Client Promoter Score, demonstrates the value clients see in the offer. It is also worth noting that 20% of flows in the Schwab Wealth Advisory in the first half of the year were from Ameritrade FCs. Validating our belief that there is a large untapped demand among Ameritrade clients for more help and advice, a significant asset and retention opportunity, which we are excited to capture in the years ahead. Client interest in the Wasmer Schroeder Strategies continues to be strong with $2.8 billion in net flows for the first half of the year. In just a few years, Wasmer Schroeder Strategies have gone from 0% to 31% of our managed account solutions assets at Schwab. This clearly demonstrates our ability to drive win-win monetization as clients have benefited from lower cost fixed income strategies than they had previously and we are benefiting from outsized flows in fixed income. Ameritrade clients migrating to Schwab are showing appetite for our advice offers. When we look at net flows into our managed investing solutions year-to-date, more than $280 million came from legacy Ameritrade clients after they migrated to Schwab.  Finally, we continue to build on our Schwab Personalized Indexing offer. In June, we rolled out a new experience for our RIA clients and gave them more flexibility to tailor their clients' Schwab Personalized Indexing portfolios. Advisors are also now able to digitally onboard their clients into our direct indexing offer and have access to a new digital dashboard that highlights the performance of each account. Turning now to client segmentation. Just last week, we launched two new branded client experiences to meet the unique needs of our retail self-directed clients with more than $1 million and those with more than $10 million in assets. The new experience for clients with $1 million to $10 million is called Schwab Private Client Services and the experience for our $10 million-plus clients is Schwab Private Wealth Services.  Our goal is to meet the needs of these clients across several key dimensions, relationships, service, operations, product and price. The differentiated experiences will include access to a dedicated Schwab consultant who can help them manage their financial life, access to dedicated service teams, access to a range of wealth management specialists, discounted mortgage pricing, special client events and more. Our high net worth clients already represent more than two-thirds of our retail client assets. And as you can see on this page, they also represent the areas where we have the greatest growth potential as these are our fastest-growing retail segments. Meeting the needs of key client segments as we are doing with these new experiences, will continue to support our long-term asset growth. We've spent quite a bit of time in this forum talking about the opportunities for growth that we see ahead. I've described in some detail how our strengths have positioned Schwab to sustain an organic growth rate of 5% to 7% over the long term by attracting new assets from existing clients and attracting new clients to Schwab. These strengths include a client base that is in the peak of wealth accumulation. Dedicated relationships, our commitment to RIA growth, our brand, our acquisition model and our workplace pipeline. As Walt shared earlier, our 2023 year-to-date organic growth rate remains in this consistent range, north of 5%, and we are well positioned for this to continue. As we've shared in prior quarters, we have an attractive $3.5 billion to $4 billion revenue opportunity ahead in wealth management as we increase advice penetration among retail clients and grow our lending offer for all clients. I'll wrap up where Walt started. Our Through Clients' Eyes strategy remains our North Star. With clients at the forefront of every decision we make, we are successfully delivering on a historic integration while making progress on our strategic focus areas. At the same time, we are adhering to the financial discipline that is the hallmark of our all-weather business model by identifying opportunities for cost savings and efficiencies that will allow us to reinvest in our clients and reward our stockholders. With this approach, we are on track to harness the tremendous long-term growth opportunities that lie ahead.  And with that, I will turn it over to Peter.\nPeter Crawford: Thank you very much, Rick. So Walt and Rick talked about how our Through Clients' Eyes strategy continues to power strong client growth, enabling us to take significant share within the wealth management category. The progress we're making with the Ameritrade acquisition and integration and our excitement about what the combination means for our clients and our stockholders. Our plans to further our industry-leading cost advantage, both through the remaining Ameritrade integration efforts and other expense reduction actions and how we're continuing to advance our broader strategic agenda. In my time today, I'll talk about how our second quarter financial performance, which was down from the very high bar we set in '22 due largely to temporary factors. Also provide an update on the slowing pace of cash realignment activity, a trend which reinforces our confidence that we're already past peak usage of temporary supplemental funding. And as the amount of that higher cost funding decreases, our core earnings power will be unlocked. And finally, I'll share an updated outlook for 2023 and some early thoughts on certain aspects of 2024 which we expect will reflect a continued return to normal for the company.  Now what I believe should become clear is that while our near-term financial performance has been impacted by client cash allocation activity, activity that we have supported and even encouraged, that activity is moderating as one would expect, which means that the potential trajectory of our longer-term financial performance should be getting increasingly clear. And as it does so, you should see the benefit of our continued growth, our tireless drive for greater efficiency and the resilience of our diversified business model. As Walt mentioned, despite the volatile environment and somewhat more muted investor sentiment, we have continued to drive healthy organic growth throughout 2023. Now if you look at our financial performance in isolation, you'd say it was a very strong quarter, nearly $5 billion of revenue and adjusted pretax margin of well over 40% and over 36% on a GAAP basis our 33rd straight quarter over 35% and $0.75 of adjusted EPS. But relative to the second quarter of last year, of course, revenue and earnings were lower. And this is almost entirely the consequence of client cash allocation activity, which has led to lower interest-earning assets and greater usage of higher cost supplemental funding, primarily CDs and FHLB which we have utilized to support this activity.  Utilization, which is temporary in nature and therefore is not expected to weigh on our long-term financial performance. And in fact, assuming stable client engagement, we believe our net interest margin this past quarter should represent a trough for the year. Thinking of interest-earning assets or assets in general, bank deposits were down 7% sequentially due to client cash allocation decisions, but we saw a significant decrease in the pace of that activity from April to May and then May to June. Our liquidity position remains quite strong, and our capital position continues to get even stronger with our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio rising to 7.5%. And what we're calling here are adjusted Tier 1 leverage ratio, which is inclusive of AOCI. And therefore, what our binding constraint would be if we lose the AOCI opt-out that ratio at our three banking subsidiaries all topping 4% by the end of the quarter.  Again, those aren't our regulatory capital ratios yet, but we expect they will be at some point in the future. And you can see we're well on our way to meeting those new regulatory requirements well ahead of the likely deadline. Now we shared in our last SMART report the dramatic reduction in the pace of client cash allocation activity from April to May. And in June, we saw a further slowing in the pace of deposit flows. And the reduction would have been even more significant or not for a large reversal in client equity allocations from sales in May to net purchases in June. Now that broader trend is encouraging, but not surprising, and it's reinforced by specific data points we see when we look under the hood. We're seeing fewer and fewer individuals making their initial purchase of an investment cash solution, a purchase money fund or CD or treasury security. And since the clients with larger cash balances moved first, again, not surprisingly, the average size of those initial purchases has also come down. In June, and this is really important. In June, we also saw a net deposit increase for our Advisor Services business. And that's significant because in this and in previous cycles, Advisor Services has tended to be a leading indicator of what will happen with Investor Services, realigning first as rates start to rise, and now slowing substantially. And as I said, actually increasing slightly their Schwab One and Bank Sweep balances in the month of June. And that's again despite of net equity purchases. As you all know, we have supported this client cash allocation activity first to be a range of organic sources, cash on hand as well as cash that comes in via new accounts and also with principal and interest payments from our securities portfolio. But to the extent that those three sources have been insufficient, we have utilized a mix of temporary sources, including CDs and short-term funding from the FHLB.  Barring an unexpected increase in deposit outflows from clients engaging more actively in the equity markets, the pace of that activity has now dropped to a level that we can cover with those organic sources. In fact, we have not initiated any new short-term borrowings or CDs since late May, which means that we have already seen a decline in that supplemental funding. Again, that encompasses CDs, FHLB and repo of $12 billion since the peak in late May.  And as client cash realignment continues to slow and eventually reverses, we'd expect those supplemental funding balances to continue to decline over the next 18 months and be mostly paid off by the end of 2024. And this means that they should not really be a factor in our earnings picture in 2025 and beyond. Looking out to the rest of the year. As client cash allocation activity abates, we'd expect to see a return of transactional cash growth later this year. And then as we continue to pay off the higher cost funding sources while driving strong organic growth, we should see a stabilization of revenue and then a resumption of growth, leading to a year-over-year revenue decline of roughly 7% to 8%. With our net interest margin expanding from here to reach a level in the mid-to 10 basis points by Q4, assuming the dot plots from a couple of weeks ago, so two more 25 basis point Fed increases. On the expense side, we've already taken steps to trim our spending levels this year such that we now expect our 2023 adjusted expense growth to be somewhere in the 6-ish percent range, inclusive of $160 million roughly million onetime FDIC surcharge. Meaning that our other spending is tracking roughly 300 basis points below the range we communicated back in January as we have adjusted and optimized our expense base consistent with Walt's earlier comments. Now turning our attention to 2024. We expect to see strong growth in revenue and profitability driven by an expansion of net interest margin into the upper 200s as we see a return of core deposit growth and pay off the vast majority of the supplemental funding we've accessed and the realization of at least $1 billion of net run rate expense synergies, including more than $500 million, pardon me, in net 2024 reductions relative to the outlook we shared back in January. And that would imply that 2024 adjusted expenses could be similar to or potentially even a little below 2023 levels. From a capital standpoint, our plan is to continue to conserve capital for the immediate future and we see a clear path towards growing our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio, inclusive of AOCI, back to our operating objective at some point in 2024. At which point, we could be in a position to return -- resume more opportunistic capital return. And then looking even longer term, we continue to see a significant opportunity for continued NIM expansion even after we realize the benefits of paying off the supplemental funding. And that comes from investing new money and reinvesting principal and interest from our existing securities portfolio at rates that are much higher than we are in today. It's important to note this would still happen even if rates fall from their peak as the dot plots currently suggest. I've spoken at length this morning about some of the dynamics that are temporarily weighing on our financial performance. And as those dynamics stayed into the background, we remain very confident that our financial formula will reassert itself to drive long-term earnings growth as it has for multiple decades. It's built on our Through Clients' Eyes strategy and no trade-offs approach which positions us to drive sustainable and consistent organic growth. And even as we've worked our way through multiple rate cycles, made disruptive moves like cutting equity commissions to 0 and acquiring Ameritrade, we've been able to convert that strong organic growth into client asset growth, revenue growth, and through ongoing expense discipline, expanding margins and then through efficient capital management, drive mid-teens plus EPS growth through the cycle. That has been the financial formula for Schwab for much of our history. And as we emerge from this unique period, we're extremely confident it will continue to reward our long-term stockholders for years, decades to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff to facilitate our Q&A. Jeff?\nJeff Edwards: Thank you, gents [ph]. Operator, can you please remind everyone of our process and go ahead and start the Q&A portion of the program.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Ken Worthington with J.P. Morgan. You may go ahead.\nKen Worthington : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. My question is on the revenue synergies from Ameritrade and your expectations now. In January, I believe you expected $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion of revenue synergies from the transaction with BDA balances as the leading driver, have? And if so, how have pass sorting in the revised BDA agreement impacted both the size and the timing of your expected revenue synergies here?\nPeter Crawford: Yes. I'll take that one. Thank you, Ken. So I'd say fundamentally, the -- we remain very, very bullish on the revenue synergies. And as you point out, the -- certainly a significant portion of those revenue synergies are coming from moving the BDA balances from TD Bank over to Schwab Bank's balance sheet over time.  And those continue despite the fact -- the way that we have renegotiated the IDA agreement, that's a more of a near-term dynamic, the long-term implication of that, the long-term planning has not changed, which is that we'd expect to move those balances over to our balance sheet and realize those revenue synergies from doing so. But that's only a part of the story. And I think the other part of the revenue synergies are -- we're very, very excited about. And those come from allowing the legacy Ameritrade clients to have access to Schwab's broader array of wealth management solutions, lending, advice, et cetera. And Rick talked in his comments about some of the early signs of progress of interest in those solutions.  If you look at the penetration rate of advice among their legacy retail clients within Schwab, it's about 19%, Ameritrade, it's about 6% or 7%. And we think that's a huge untapped need, we know those clients are interested in that advice, and we're very, very excited about that opportunity, which we think will unfold over multiple years.\nOperator: The next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. You may go ahead.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. Peter, understanding that the client cash has been -- sorting has been slowing throughout the quarter. But your outlook for resumption of deposit growth is prior to year-end. Just curious, normally, you have positive seasonality with cash build around December. Are you assuming growth in deposits ex the normal seasonal benefit?\nPeter Crawford: Yes. Dan, I don't know if I want to parse it quite that finely. I mean, I would say is we do expect that we'll see a resumption. I mean if you look at the trends from frankly, even from the first quarter from March to April, April to May, May to June, and you don't have to do too unusual, I guess, extrapolations to see that flipping. So we'd expect we'll see return of deposit growth I would say, ahead of that typical seasonal buildup that you get in later November and into December.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Thanks, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just on that subject, if we do see the build in deposits as we move through the year, and into '24. Peter, can you talk about what type of LCR ratio would you prefer to operate in? It's been I think, historically in the last year or so in the 110% to 130% range, it was well above 100%. But is that a range that you would generally like to stay in? Or in the new environment, would you prefer to build liquidity over and above that range? And then if it's in that range, could that imply faster FHLB pay down than your model potentially?\nPeter Crawford: Yes. So I mean I think -- I guess I would say, answer this a couple of ways. I mean when we think about LCR, what we really focus on is the LCR and there is certainly there's LCR at the banks, but there's also LCR at the parent. And when we look at the LCR at the parent, that's really driven more by what's happening on the broker-dealer side. That tends to be the -- we have -- and so that is a function of what's happening with margin balances, free credit balances and so forth. Within the banks, we certainly have ample access and ample liquidity, a very, very liquid portfolio there. We have been running a little bit higher levels of cash. I'd expect that as we continue to put some distance between now and where we were back in March and sort of the -- some of the stresses around the banking system, we'll continue to let those cash levels decline, and that will be a contributor to paying down some and retiring some of the CDs and the FHLB. So I would say that would probably be the bigger factor is continue to let those cash balances decline back closer to our operating objective, which is more around 5% or 6% of deposits.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. You may go ahead.\nMichael Anagnostakis : Good morning. It's Michael Anagnostakis on for Steven. Just maybe another one on the balance sheet here. Now that it feels like a dust has settled from the banking crisis. Is selling down a portion of the securities portfolio is something you're considering to pay down high-cost borrowing sooner? And from a regulatory perspective, would your lower Tier 1 leverage inclusive of AOCI preclude you from crystallizing those losses? Thank you.\nPeter Crawford: Yes. Thanks very much for the question. I know there's been a lot of I guess, speculation on this and a lot of discussion about this. I'm glad you asked this. So let me reiterate, first and foremost, we do not need to and something we said previously, we do not need to sell securities. We have plenty of liquidity to support the client cash allocation activity. As we talked about, that activity is slowing and remain quite profitable. Our capital levels are growing, and our NIM is poised to improve, as we've talked about. At the same time, we certainly recognize that selling securities can look good on paper from a financial standpoint as it would accelerate some of the trends that we'd otherwise see, things like increasing our go-forward net interest margin, net interest revenue, accelerating the paydown of borrowing, building our capital levels.  But the important point is that's an acceleration of trends that are already happening. And we're very mindful of the potential risks that doing something like that could be misunderstood or misperceived by the outside world and most importantly, by our clients. And so I would say it remains something we won't rule out, but it's not something we are actively pursuing at this time. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Good morning. And thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could elaborate a bit more on some of the steps you guys are taking to expand advice penetration within the retail customer set. I think that's maybe around 14% today, advice penetration of the retail customers. What actions can you guys do to accelerate and lift that higher over time? What level do you think is achievable if you look out like five years, is 20% reasonable? And which offerings and services do you think will be the most meaningful in helping drive that uplift?\nRick Wurster: So I would say that we have lots of opportunity in driving advice penetration. And the reason being that -- our clients are increasingly looking to us for advice. They want help and guidance in all measures where we survey clients. They're asking for more help and guidance, and we'd like certainly for Schwab clients to turn to us for help and guidance.  We want to provide what they need. We've done a lot to try to bolster our offerings, and I'll share a few things. The first thing we've done is we've taken our proprietary Schwab Wealth Advisory offering, which is our wealth full-service wealth management offer to clients, and we've invested in it tremendously in the past couple of years. And we've seen the returns to that. As you can see by the 90% increase in flows -- 89% increase in net flows that we reported as well as the really strong Client Promoter Scores that we consistently earn in that offer. So the investments have been paying off, and we've seen an acceleration of growth there. And as I mentioned earlier, a lot of it has come from Ameritrade clients who didn't have access to a program like this previously that are now turning towards it. So that is all encouraging. We also, as you are aware, bought Wasmer Schroeder a few years ago, we're seeing just tremendous growth in the fixed income space for clients that want help and guidance there. And then we are encouraged by what we're seeing in Schwab Personalized Indexing.  We believe 5, 10 years from now, taxable assets that will be the primary location that clients save or invest in taking share from ETFs over time. And we're at the forefront of that, driving down the cost for clients to participate in that as well as the minimum asset tax. We've democratized access to personalized investing, which is very much in line with our heritage. And then finally, what I would say is our SAN program, our Schwab Advisor Network program continues to grow. And gain really strong flows on our platform. We want to make sure clients have access to whatever help and guidance they need, whether it's a Schwab proprietary offer or something through our advisor network, and we continue to see robust flows there. The combination of all that is growing at Schwab, and it's also growing among Ameritrade clients. So we think the future is really bright in wealth. We've invested a lot in it. And thankfully, we're seeing the returns to those investments, both at Schwab and among our Ameritrade clients.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Blostein: Hi. Good morning, everybody. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color on sort of how net new money is allocating cash once they get into Schwab. So as you think about your organic growth kind of in that 5-ish, 6-ish% range recently, what percentage of the cash that comes across actually goes into the Schwab Bank versus into some of the higher-yielding options? Thanks. \nPeter Crawford: Yes, it's a tough -- I mean we get this question a lot, and it's a really tough question to answer because it really is kind of what time frame are you looking at when you answer that question. I mean the money tends to come in heavily in the form of cash, sort of 45% or 50% maybe in the form of cash. But over time, not surprisingly, it gets invested and it gets invested in ways that look similar to our existing clients. So clients often will bring in cash, invest in the equity markets, invest in mutual funds, fixed income and typically leave some of that cash on the balance sheet as transactional cash. So it really depends, new accounts versus existing accounts tend to have different behavior. But I would say that in aggregate, over time, as we grow new accounts, those new accounts typically bring a level of transactional cash that helps to offset or more than offset any residual client-cash realignment activity that's happening among our existing accounts. And so that becomes an important source of deposit growth over time.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS. You may go ahead.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Curious, Peter, if you have considered what TLAC, if that was applied to Schwab might mean and what that would mean as far as the long-term debt that you might need to carry, obviously, not versus where we are today because we've got this big buildup of the wholesale. But once we get to sort of steady state versus the steady state before this all began, have you considered that and what that impact that might have?\nPeter Crawford: Yes. We certainly have considered and looked at that. And I think there's still a number of dimensions of that, that are to be determined. And so the implications are a little bit up in the air. But I would say the bottom line is none of the implications we think are going to be in any way disruptive.  I mean they'll be very manageable depending on how it's -- the TLAC is calibrated, whether it's calibrated at the G-SIB level or it's calibrated at sort of lower level. Based on the analysis we've seen, we could have either enough debt already or have to issue a very modest amount, I mean, sort of a couple of billion dollars, $2 billion, $3 billion of incremental debt. So again, when you think about the carrying cost of that, it's quite modest. So we don't see that as being a sort of a significant factor moving forward.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Benjamin Budish with Barclays. You may go ahead.\nBenjamin Budish: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to double check on the incremental cost synergies you talked about in the slide deck, you mentioned that the 2024 expense growth of kind of flat to negative is based on the assumption that you realized those savings. Is that sort of the plan that the remaining $500 million plus the additional $500 million will all be realized over the course of '24? And then how do we think about the risk that expense growth could be? Slightly positive or just the kind of parameters around which we might think about modeling next year's OpEx growth?\nPeter Crawford: Sure. So as we shared previously, the $500 million of remaining expense synergies related to the integration, the majority of those will be unlocked as we complete the integration in the months after we complete integration. So as we shared previously, we'd expect that the vast majority of that $500 million will be realized on a run rate basis by the end of 2024. The $500 million of incremental expense savings that Walt previewed in his comments, we'd expect the vast majority of those to be realized by the end of 2023 and so those would have a -- will also have an impact on 2024, but those are incremental to -- those are not contemplated in the scenario that we had shared at the Winter Business Update, where I think we talked about something like 4% to 5% adjusted expense growth from '23 to '24.  You take that and you just subtract that at least that $500 million plus as we talked about, that's how you get to flat to negative adjusted expense growth from '23 to '24. But again, given the fact that we're realizing some of the expense synergies related to integration in 2024, that will clearly have a benefit as we go from '24 to '25 as well. So it's really looking at two years of sort of below trend expense growth not just the expense growth.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Chris Allen with Citi. You may go ahead.\nChristopher Allen: Good morning, everyone. I was wondering if you could provide an update on the technological improvement expected for the lending platform this summer. Assuming deposit growth picks up later this year, how do you see the asset side of the balance sheet expanding, do you see more of a mix shift towards lending versus rebuilding the securities book?\nRick Wurster: Yes. We've got some exciting developments on the lending side. One of the things we're thrilled to do is launch a digital Pledged Asset Line experience here during the month of July to our advisers, and we anticipate that will be among the easiest and fastest pledge asset line experience in the industry. We'll do the same in retail. We'll follow with retail. And there's a number of other things we've done on the lending side to make it easier for our higher net worth clients to get a mortgage through Schwab. We've also done things you've seen. I'm sure with our investor advantage pricing, which makes taking the loan through Schwab if you're a client and have assets with us, again, among the lowest cost places to get a loan. So we see the opportunity for meaningful growth here. Lending environment clearly is challenging. So we're not seeing the returns to those investments just yet that we might otherwise have seen.  But what's important is we are laying the foundation for when the lending environment is appealing more and more clients will turn to Schwab for their lending because we've made it easier, we've made it more seamless, we've made it even less costly, and there should be no better place to take a Pledged Asset Line or a mortgage than through your relationship here at Schwab. So we feel confident that when the lending environment improves, we're going to be there.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Patrick Moley with Piper Sandler. You may go ahead.\nPatrick Moley: Yes. So I just wanted to go back to the $500 million of incremental cost saves. Wondering if you could elaborate a little more on the areas that those cost saves are coming from? Walt mentioned real estate savings as a driver. And I know last week you announced that you were downsizing, you're closing offices in I think it was over 10 cities. I just wondering if you could maybe quantify the impact from that reduction in the real estate footprint? And then maybe how much of that was already baked into the AMTD integration cost saves that you guided to? And how much of that is maybe newer? Thanks.\nWalt Bettinger: Sure. Thanks. So all of it is incremental. None of that was baked into the Ameritrade integration saves. I think one of the items that's important to understand is that over the last several years, as we began preparation for the integration, we recognize that having that go smoothly for the new clients from Ameritrade that would be joining Schwab was the single most important thing we could do.  And so when it came to spending and investing, the answer was yes awful lot. In fact, if you look at our current expenses today and compare them to the sum of what Schwab and Ameritrade's expenses were at the time of the announcement of the acquisition, they're about 20% higher than they were at that date.  And so this fairly significant ramp-up of hiring and expenses that we have incurred in the last three years to ensure this integration went well, we now will be faced with the opportunity to unwind that. So when I talk about $500 million plus in addition to the remaining $500 million from integration from Ameritrade, that's what gets us to over $1 billion in expense savings that we'll recognize between the remaining months in 2023 as well as Peter referenced, in 2024 from the integration wrapping up.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Kyle Voigt with KBW. You may go ahead.\nKyle Voigt : Hi, good morning. I'm assuming the repayment expectations for short-term funding through 2024 is part driven by the growing client cash and in part by the shrinking securities portfolio. So my question is on the securities portfolio specifically. If you look at average balances, they were down about 4.3% sequentially or $14 billion. I guess when you look at the current maturity schedule and expectations for prepayments in the current interest rate environment, what are your updated expectations on how that securities portfolio, how the balances could trend over the next six months or maybe 12 months?\nPeter Crawford: So the way I think about it is in terms of when we think about it, we think about sort of the principal and interest payments of the securities portfolio, and we use that as a mechanism to support the cash realignment activity and then also to pay down some of the short-term borrowings.  And that's tracking about $5-ish billion per month, $15 billion per quarter as that portfolio shrinks, that, of course, that month -- those monthly cash flows will decrease modestly. But even in through next year, we still expect that to -- those monthly -- that monthly activity to be $4 billion plus $4 billion to $5 billion, somewhere in that range over the course of 2024 as well.\nJeff Edwards: And just operator, looking at the clock, I think we have time for one last question before we wrap.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question is from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. You may go ahead.\nDevin Ryan: Thanks. Good morning. Most questions have been asked here. Maybe just one kind of ticky tack on the model. Your securities lending revenues have been bouncing back a little bit. And just want to get a -- and that can move the NIM around. So I want to get a sense of how you guys think about kind of a normalized level of securities lending. And if we should just be looking for kind of what's happening in the capital markets, I know when there's more active maybe IPO market or type of market environment that can be better. So just thinking about what's going to move that back to levels that were, I think, healthier back in late 2021?\nPeter Crawford: Yes. So you're right. So securities lending revenue does move around, it can move around month-to-month day-to-day, frankly, based off of oftentimes demand for a relatively small number of hard-to-borrow stocks, and that's really what we focus on is the hard-to-borrow stocks. We're the largest lender in the industry for those hard-to-borrow stocks. And many times, they are event driven, whether it's a SPAC or de-SPAC situation or IPO or whatever it might be. I think over time, I guess I would say two things. One is over time, I do -- we would expect that securities lending revenue to grow with the growth in margin balances because that creates more inventory and the growth in our total client assets. At the same time, we see a significant opportunity to continue to grow sec lending revenue sort of irrespective of what happens with balances. We talked previously about the combination of the green and blue sec lending capabilities on the Ameritrade side has access to more hard-to-borrow stocks. But on the blue side, on the Schwab side, we have had some more advanced capabilities, such as a fully -- a more mature fully paid program. And so we're very, very excited about that combination and continue to unlock the significant opportunities that combination provides and for example, making more of our clients aware of the fully paid opportunity. So I think that -- we see that as a revenue synergy from the combination and a great opportunity moving forward. Okay. And I think that is -- I think that we said that was our last question. So let me just close this out here as we're getting to the bottom of the hour. There's no doubt that the last few months have presented some challenges for our clients, our people and our business. And Walt spoke at the outset about the metaphorical fog that has obscured I think the enduring quality of the Schwab franchise.  And as we're sitting here today in this 100-degree Texas heat, it feels like that fog is starting to clear and as it does, I think what you see as a company building loyalty among clients that is among the highest in the industry. Producing consistent 5% to 7% organic growth, positioned strongly in the two fastest-growing segments in wealth management.  Delivering consistent profitability highlighted by a 42% adjusted pretax margin during one of our toughest quarters in a long time and pursuing a lot of opportunities with the Ameritrade integration and beyond to drive growth and to deliver even greater efficiency. And as I hope you've gleaned over this past hour, we remain very confident about the path forward and our future, and we look forward to discussing our continued progress with you at our next update in October. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Crawford",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Rick. So Walt and Rick talked about how our Through Clients' Eyes strategy continues to power strong client growth, enabling us to take significant share within the wealth management category. The progress we're making with the Ameritrade acquisition and integration and our excitement about what the combination means for our clients and our stockholders. Our plans to further our industry-leading cost advantage, both through the remaining Ameritrade integration efforts and other expense reduction actions and how we're continuing to advance our broader strategic agenda. In my time today, I'll talk about how our second quarter financial performance, which was down from the very high bar we set in '22 due largely to temporary factors. Also provide an update on the slowing pace of cash realignment activity, a trend which reinforces our confidence that we're already past peak usage of temporary supplemental funding. And as the amount of that higher cost funding decreases, our core earnings power will be unlocked. And finally, I'll share an updated outlook for 2023 and some early thoughts on certain aspects of 2024 which we expect will reflect a continued return to normal for the company.  Now what I believe should become clear is that while our near-term financial performance has been impacted by client cash allocation activity, activity that we have supported and even encouraged, that activity is moderating as one would expect, which means that the potential trajectory of our longer-term financial performance should be getting increasingly clear. And as it does so, you should see the benefit of our continued growth, our tireless drive for greater efficiency and the resilience of our diversified business model. As Walt mentioned, despite the volatile environment and somewhat more muted investor sentiment, we have continued to drive healthy organic growth throughout 2023. Now if you look at our financial performance in isolation, you'd say it was a very strong quarter, nearly $5 billion of revenue and adjusted pretax margin of well over 40% and over 36% on a GAAP basis our 33rd straight quarter over 35% and $0.75 of adjusted EPS. But relative to the second quarter of last year, of course, revenue and earnings were lower. And this is almost entirely the consequence of client cash allocation activity, which has led to lower interest-earning assets and greater usage of higher cost supplemental funding, primarily CDs and FHLB which we have utilized to support this activity.  Utilization, which is temporary in nature and therefore is not expected to weigh on our long-term financial performance. And in fact, assuming stable client engagement, we believe our net interest margin this past quarter should represent a trough for the year. Thinking of interest-earning assets or assets in general, bank deposits were down 7% sequentially due to client cash allocation decisions, but we saw a significant decrease in the pace of that activity from April to May and then May to June. Our liquidity position remains quite strong, and our capital position continues to get even stronger with our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio rising to 7.5%. And what we're calling here are adjusted Tier 1 leverage ratio, which is inclusive of AOCI. And therefore, what our binding constraint would be if we lose the AOCI opt-out that ratio at our three banking subsidiaries all topping 4% by the end of the quarter.  Again, those aren't our regulatory capital ratios yet, but we expect they will be at some point in the future. And you can see we're well on our way to meeting those new regulatory requirements well ahead of the likely deadline. Now we shared in our last SMART report the dramatic reduction in the pace of client cash allocation activity from April to May. And in June, we saw a further slowing in the pace of deposit flows. And the reduction would have been even more significant or not for a large reversal in client equity allocations from sales in May to net purchases in June. Now that broader trend is encouraging, but not surprising, and it's reinforced by specific data points we see when we look under the hood. We're seeing fewer and fewer individuals making their initial purchase of an investment cash solution, a purchase money fund or CD or treasury security. And since the clients with larger cash balances moved first, again, not surprisingly, the average size of those initial purchases has also come down. In June, and this is really important. In June, we also saw a net deposit increase for our Advisor Services business. And that's significant because in this and in previous cycles, Advisor Services has tended to be a leading indicator of what will happen with Investor Services, realigning first as rates start to rise, and now slowing substantially. And as I said, actually increasing slightly their Schwab One and Bank Sweep balances in the month of June. And that's again despite of net equity purchases. As you all know, we have supported this client cash allocation activity first to be a range of organic sources, cash on hand as well as cash that comes in via new accounts and also with principal and interest payments from our securities portfolio. But to the extent that those three sources have been insufficient, we have utilized a mix of temporary sources, including CDs and short-term funding from the FHLB.  Barring an unexpected increase in deposit outflows from clients engaging more actively in the equity markets, the pace of that activity has now dropped to a level that we can cover with those organic sources. In fact, we have not initiated any new short-term borrowings or CDs since late May, which means that we have already seen a decline in that supplemental funding. Again, that encompasses CDs, FHLB and repo of $12 billion since the peak in late May.  And as client cash realignment continues to slow and eventually reverses, we'd expect those supplemental funding balances to continue to decline over the next 18 months and be mostly paid off by the end of 2024. And this means that they should not really be a factor in our earnings picture in 2025 and beyond. Looking out to the rest of the year. As client cash allocation activity abates, we'd expect to see a return of transactional cash growth later this year. And then as we continue to pay off the higher cost funding sources while driving strong organic growth, we should see a stabilization of revenue and then a resumption of growth, leading to a year-over-year revenue decline of roughly 7% to 8%. With our net interest margin expanding from here to reach a level in the mid-to 10 basis points by Q4, assuming the dot plots from a couple of weeks ago, so two more 25 basis point Fed increases. On the expense side, we've already taken steps to trim our spending levels this year such that we now expect our 2023 adjusted expense growth to be somewhere in the 6-ish percent range, inclusive of $160 million roughly million onetime FDIC surcharge. Meaning that our other spending is tracking roughly 300 basis points below the range we communicated back in January as we have adjusted and optimized our expense base consistent with Walt's earlier comments. Now turning our attention to 2024. We expect to see strong growth in revenue and profitability driven by an expansion of net interest margin into the upper 200s as we see a return of core deposit growth and pay off the vast majority of the supplemental funding we've accessed and the realization of at least $1 billion of net run rate expense synergies, including more than $500 million, pardon me, in net 2024 reductions relative to the outlook we shared back in January. And that would imply that 2024 adjusted expenses could be similar to or potentially even a little below 2023 levels. From a capital standpoint, our plan is to continue to conserve capital for the immediate future and we see a clear path towards growing our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio, inclusive of AOCI, back to our operating objective at some point in 2024. At which point, we could be in a position to return -- resume more opportunistic capital return. And then looking even longer term, we continue to see a significant opportunity for continued NIM expansion even after we realize the benefits of paying off the supplemental funding. And that comes from investing new money and reinvesting principal and interest from our existing securities portfolio at rates that are much higher than we are in today. It's important to note this would still happen even if rates fall from their peak as the dot plots currently suggest. I've spoken at length this morning about some of the dynamics that are temporarily weighing on our financial performance. And as those dynamics stayed into the background, we remain very confident that our financial formula will reassert itself to drive long-term earnings growth as it has for multiple decades. It's built on our Through Clients' Eyes strategy and no trade-offs approach which positions us to drive sustainable and consistent organic growth. And even as we've worked our way through multiple rate cycles, made disruptive moves like cutting equity commissions to 0 and acquiring Ameritrade, we've been able to convert that strong organic growth into client asset growth, revenue growth, and through ongoing expense discipline, expanding margins and then through efficient capital management, drive mid-teens plus EPS growth through the cycle. That has been the financial formula for Schwab for much of our history. And as we emerge from this unique period, we're extremely confident it will continue to reward our long-term stockholders for years, decades to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff to facilitate our Q&A. Jeff? Yes. I'll take that one. Thank you, Ken. So I'd say fundamentally, the -- we remain very, very bullish on the revenue synergies. And as you point out, the -- certainly a significant portion of those revenue synergies are coming from moving the BDA balances from TD Bank over to Schwab Bank's balance sheet over time.  And those continue despite the fact -- the way that we have renegotiated the IDA agreement, that's a more of a near-term dynamic, the long-term implication of that, the long-term planning has not changed, which is that we'd expect to move those balances over to our balance sheet and realize those revenue synergies from doing so. But that's only a part of the story. And I think the other part of the revenue synergies are -- we're very, very excited about. And those come from allowing the legacy Ameritrade clients to have access to Schwab's broader array of wealth management solutions, lending, advice, et cetera. And Rick talked in his comments about some of the early signs of progress of interest in those solutions.  If you look at the penetration rate of advice among their legacy retail clients within Schwab, it's about 19%, Ameritrade, it's about 6% or 7%. And we think that's a huge untapped need, we know those clients are interested in that advice, and we're very, very excited about that opportunity, which we think will unfold over multiple years. Yes. Dan, I don't know if I want to parse it quite that finely. I mean, I would say is we do expect that we'll see a resumption. I mean if you look at the trends from frankly, even from the first quarter from March to April, April to May, May to June, and you don't have to do too unusual, I guess, extrapolations to see that flipping. So we'd expect we'll see return of deposit growth I would say, ahead of that typical seasonal buildup that you get in later November and into December. Yes. So I mean I think -- I guess I would say, answer this a couple of ways. I mean when we think about LCR, what we really focus on is the LCR and there is certainly there's LCR at the banks, but there's also LCR at the parent. And when we look at the LCR at the parent, that's really driven more by what's happening on the broker-dealer side. That tends to be the -- we have -- and so that is a function of what's happening with margin balances, free credit balances and so forth. Within the banks, we certainly have ample access and ample liquidity, a very, very liquid portfolio there. We have been running a little bit higher levels of cash. I'd expect that as we continue to put some distance between now and where we were back in March and sort of the -- some of the stresses around the banking system, we'll continue to let those cash levels decline, and that will be a contributor to paying down some and retiring some of the CDs and the FHLB. So I would say that would probably be the bigger factor is continue to let those cash balances decline back closer to our operating objective, which is more around 5% or 6% of deposits. Yes. Thanks very much for the question. I know there's been a lot of I guess, speculation on this and a lot of discussion about this. I'm glad you asked this. So let me reiterate, first and foremost, we do not need to and something we said previously, we do not need to sell securities. We have plenty of liquidity to support the client cash allocation activity. As we talked about, that activity is slowing and remain quite profitable. Our capital levels are growing, and our NIM is poised to improve, as we've talked about. At the same time, we certainly recognize that selling securities can look good on paper from a financial standpoint as it would accelerate some of the trends that we'd otherwise see, things like increasing our go-forward net interest margin, net interest revenue, accelerating the paydown of borrowing, building our capital levels.  But the important point is that's an acceleration of trends that are already happening. And we're very mindful of the potential risks that doing something like that could be misunderstood or misperceived by the outside world and most importantly, by our clients. And so I would say it remains something we won't rule out, but it's not something we are actively pursuing at this time. Thanks for the question. Yes, it's a tough -- I mean we get this question a lot, and it's a really tough question to answer because it really is kind of what time frame are you looking at when you answer that question. I mean the money tends to come in heavily in the form of cash, sort of 45% or 50% maybe in the form of cash. But over time, not surprisingly, it gets invested and it gets invested in ways that look similar to our existing clients. So clients often will bring in cash, invest in the equity markets, invest in mutual funds, fixed income and typically leave some of that cash on the balance sheet as transactional cash. So it really depends, new accounts versus existing accounts tend to have different behavior. But I would say that in aggregate, over time, as we grow new accounts, those new accounts typically bring a level of transactional cash that helps to offset or more than offset any residual client-cash realignment activity that's happening among our existing accounts. And so that becomes an important source of deposit growth over time. Yes. We certainly have considered and looked at that. And I think there's still a number of dimensions of that, that are to be determined. And so the implications are a little bit up in the air. But I would say the bottom line is none of the implications we think are going to be in any way disruptive.  I mean they'll be very manageable depending on how it's -- the TLAC is calibrated, whether it's calibrated at the G-SIB level or it's calibrated at sort of lower level. Based on the analysis we've seen, we could have either enough debt already or have to issue a very modest amount, I mean, sort of a couple of billion dollars, $2 billion, $3 billion of incremental debt. So again, when you think about the carrying cost of that, it's quite modest. So we don't see that as being a sort of a significant factor moving forward. Sure. So as we shared previously, the $500 million of remaining expense synergies related to the integration, the majority of those will be unlocked as we complete the integration in the months after we complete integration. So as we shared previously, we'd expect that the vast majority of that $500 million will be realized on a run rate basis by the end of 2024. The $500 million of incremental expense savings that Walt previewed in his comments, we'd expect the vast majority of those to be realized by the end of 2023 and so those would have a -- will also have an impact on 2024, but those are incremental to -- those are not contemplated in the scenario that we had shared at the Winter Business Update, where I think we talked about something like 4% to 5% adjusted expense growth from '23 to '24.  You take that and you just subtract that at least that $500 million plus as we talked about, that's how you get to flat to negative adjusted expense growth from '23 to '24. But again, given the fact that we're realizing some of the expense synergies related to integration in 2024, that will clearly have a benefit as we go from '24 to '25 as well. So it's really looking at two years of sort of below trend expense growth not just the expense growth. So the way I think about it is in terms of when we think about it, we think about sort of the principal and interest payments of the securities portfolio, and we use that as a mechanism to support the cash realignment activity and then also to pay down some of the short-term borrowings.  And that's tracking about $5-ish billion per month, $15 billion per quarter as that portfolio shrinks, that, of course, that month -- those monthly cash flows will decrease modestly. But even in through next year, we still expect that to -- those monthly -- that monthly activity to be $4 billion plus $4 billion to $5 billion, somewhere in that range over the course of 2024 as well. Yes. So you're right. So securities lending revenue does move around, it can move around month-to-month day-to-day, frankly, based off of oftentimes demand for a relatively small number of hard-to-borrow stocks, and that's really what we focus on is the hard-to-borrow stocks. We're the largest lender in the industry for those hard-to-borrow stocks. And many times, they are event driven, whether it's a SPAC or de-SPAC situation or IPO or whatever it might be. I think over time, I guess I would say two things. One is over time, I do -- we would expect that securities lending revenue to grow with the growth in margin balances because that creates more inventory and the growth in our total client assets. At the same time, we see a significant opportunity to continue to grow sec lending revenue sort of irrespective of what happens with balances. We talked previously about the combination of the green and blue sec lending capabilities on the Ameritrade side has access to more hard-to-borrow stocks. But on the blue side, on the Schwab side, we have had some more advanced capabilities, such as a fully -- a more mature fully paid program. And so we're very, very excited about that combination and continue to unlock the significant opportunities that combination provides and for example, making more of our clients aware of the fully paid opportunity. So I think that -- we see that as a revenue synergy from the combination and a great opportunity moving forward. Okay. And I think that is -- I think that we said that was our last question. So let me just close this out here as we're getting to the bottom of the hour. There's no doubt that the last few months have presented some challenges for our clients, our people and our business. And Walt spoke at the outset about the metaphorical fog that has obscured I think the enduring quality of the Schwab franchise.  And as we're sitting here today in this 100-degree Texas heat, it feels like that fog is starting to clear and as it does, I think what you see as a company building loyalty among clients that is among the highest in the industry. Producing consistent 5% to 7% organic growth, positioned strongly in the two fastest-growing segments in wealth management.  Delivering consistent profitability highlighted by a 42% adjusted pretax margin during one of our toughest quarters in a long time and pursuing a lot of opportunities with the Ameritrade integration and beyond to drive growth and to deliver even greater efficiency. And as I hope you've gleaned over this past hour, we remain very confident about the path forward and our future, and we look forward to discussing our continued progress with you at our next update in October. Thanks, everyone."

            "name": "Walt Bettinger",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff. And good morning, everyone. I'm looking forward to another triple-digit day here in Texas. It's a beautiful day, but it definitely will be a scorcher. A number of years ago, I used an illustration that seems timely to resurrect. When my office used to be in downtown San Francisco, I would often look out toward Treasure Island early in the morning only to see dense fog. And the fog would not only mask the beauty of Treasure Island, it would often be so dense that you couldn't even see the island out in the Bay. In fact, if you didn't know it was there, you might not even realize Treasure Island even existed. In some ways, it seems to me that the fog has settled in again, just as it did a few years ago, and that fog is clouding how some see Charles Schwab today. Years ago, the fog represented the extended period of ZIRP. Or 0 interest rates. Today, the fog represents the short-term challenges brought on by the near record pace of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve. But as we all know, the fog clouding Treasure Island ultimately lifts and the beauty of Treasure Island becomes clear. And of course, Treasure Island represents Charles Schwab.  Some look at the fog and only see fog. Some look at the fog and know what is temporarily hidden by it and recognize how that fog is currently masking the extraordinary progress we are making as a firm. Those who know what is hidden by the fog recognize our ongoing organic growth and market share gains, successful execution and integration of the largest brokerage combination in history.  Ideal positioning with leadership positions in the two fastest-growing areas of investment services, that's serving registered investment advisors and serving independent minded [technical difficulty] -- the low-cost provider today and poised to widen this advantage over the next 18 to 24 months, and exceptional profitability even in the most challenging of times. Today's presentations and discussions are intended to help more people understand the fog as well as what is hidden by the fog. So thanks a lot for following along. Although still somewhat uneven, the second quarter began to show some signs of an improving economic and investing environment. Inflation began to moderate and while the Fed paused its record pace of interest rates at -- interest rate increases, at least for the month of June.  As equity market volatility fell, overall equity markets performed reasonably well, but it was an exceptionally narrow market with just a handful or two of large-cap growth companies accounting for a significant percentage of the solid performance. Investors took note, and as you can see, investor sentiment turned positive by the end of the quarter. Our investor clients remained relatively active in the markets, making over five million trades per day and with purchases exceeding sales by about 20%. Year-to-date, our clients have entrusted us with over $180 billion in net new assets, a strong number given the tax month of April falls in the first half of the year. And a level of net new assets consistent with our long-term historical trend of net new assets between 5% and 7% of our total asset base. In addition, clients have opened approximately two million new accounts year-to-date.  Key client metrics continue to be solid. In retail, our speed to answer phone calls averaged under 20 seconds, and this is a particularly important metric as we transitioned millions of former Ameritrade clients over to Schwab during the first half of the year. Advisory flows in retail were also solid at over $13 billion. In Advisor Services, we continue to be the destination of choice for breakaway brokers and broker teams of all sizes. Year-to-date, we've assisted almost 160 teams moving over to independents with Schwab as their primary custodian and the average advisor manages about $90 million who converted to independents.  Of course, these near-term metrics are important, but the long-term success of Schwab is even more important and revealing. We have a distinctive set of competitive advantages built over multiple decades that enable us to serve clients in a better way, while at the same time, rewarding our stockholders.  Our advantages revolve around our size and scale, our operating efficiency, service culture, operating structure, reputation and willingness to be disruptive. These six advantages help us to execute on our Through Clients' Eyes strategy, which has resulted in a dramatic increase in market share over the past decade, as we've meaningfully grown our market share of client assets by multiples of our key competitors at independent broker-dealers as well as wirehouses. And this change in market share is more than simply numbers on a page. It represents millions of clients and hundreds of billions of dollars of client assets proactively choosing Schwab and in doing so, getting a better deal than what they traditionally experienced.  And while our scale and efficiency has positioned us as the low-cost provider for many years, we are ready to widen that gap meaningfully in the next 18 months. As we reap the efficiency and automation benefits of the Ameritrade integration. We anticipate the realization of expense savings to be substantial. In addition to the remaining $500 million of synergy savings that we originally committed to as part of the Ameritrade acquisition, we now anticipate achieving at least an additional $500 million in future expense savings. These savings will come from a variety of areas, real estate savings, lower headcount from efficiencies gained via automation built and implemented as part of the integration work, streamlining our organization to ensure we are set up to operate most efficiently post integration. And the removal of temporary expenses that were associated with the integration that we added to ensure a smooth and thoughtful process for our clients. Now Rick, before I turn it over to you to discuss in more depth where we stand with our integration process and the ongoing success we're seeing with existing clients and new prospects, I wanted to simply reinforce the strength of our firm. The successful track record we have built up over decades continues. The competitive advantages we have built, continue. And I'm quite confident that the fog temporarily shrouding our firm will lift and sunny days will return in the coming quarters.  Rick? Sure. Thanks. So all of it is incremental. None of that was baked into the Ameritrade integration saves. I think one of the items that's important to understand is that over the last several years, as we began preparation for the integration, we recognize that having that go smoothly for the new clients from Ameritrade that would be joining Schwab was the single most important thing we could do.  And so when it came to spending and investing, the answer was yes awful lot. In fact, if you look at our current expenses today and compare them to the sum of what Schwab and Ameritrade's expenses were at the time of the announcement of the acquisition, they're about 20% higher than they were at that date.  And so this fairly significant ramp-up of hiring and expenses that we have incurred in the last three years to ensure this integration went well, we now will be faced with the opportunity to unwind that. So when I talk about $500 million plus in addition to the remaining $500 million from integration from Ameritrade, that's what gets us to over $1 billion in expense savings that we'll recognize between the remaining months in 2023 as well as Peter referenced, in 2024 from the integration wrapping up."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Rick Wurster",
            "content": "Thank you, Walt, and hello, everyone. Our efforts remain squarely focused on our three strategic areas, scale and efficiency, win-win monetization and client segmentation. In our time today, I'll highlight the progress we've made in each focus area and talk through the opportunities that we see ahead. Starting with scale and efficiency, integration has been and remains our number one priority. Over Memorial Day weekend, we completed the largest brokerage conversion in the industry, moving more than five million client accounts from Ameritrade to Schwab.  Thanks to the dedication of an incredible team. The conversion was a success. No material issues occurred despite the fact we migrated 11 times more clients than our previous February conversion weekend. Client engagement has been strong with 1.3 million clients logging into Schwab within the first week following the conversion weekend.  In fact, Schwab's second largest market open occurred with no issues on a Tuesday immediately following Memorial Day. And by the end of the day on that Tuesday, our service levels had returned to normal, with us answering calls at an average of seven seconds just a day after the conversion.  More broadly, client and asset attrition within our conversion groups have been below expectations. While we are still in the middle of what has been a successful client conversion, we remain laser-focused on seeing it through to completion in the months ahead. We are on track to migrate the remaining Ameritrade clients in three additional transition groups in September, November and in the first half of 2024. One of the exciting parts of our conversion is the combined capabilities for our clients, whether they are a retail client or an advisor client. And I'd like to start by sharing the benefits on the retail side. We have invested in our web and mobile experiences at Schwab to ensure we have the best of the features and functionalities of both firms. Our former Ameritrade clients will have access to the full spectrum of portfolio and wealth management solutions that we have had at Schwab. Ameritrade clients will also be able to access our banking capabilities, our branch network experience and our exceptional client service. The branch network experience includes providing access to planning and wealth management capabilities that were not a focus of Ameritrade. We believe that will help Ameritrade clients consolidate at Schwab rather than rely upon a second firm.  Now let me discuss the benefits to Schwab's retail clients. One of the biggest enhancements for existing Schwab clients will come when we make thinkorswim available to them later this year. Thinkorswim is one of the crown jewels of Ameritrade. And it's widely considered to be the premier trading platform in the market today, with its unique combination of powerful tools and dedicated service from experienced trading professionals alongside education, for all levels of experience. And all retail clients will have this at our competitive pricing representing our true no trade-offs approach.  The same is true for our RIA clients. Ameritrade advisors will migrate to Schwab over the September conversion weekend, but they already have access to meaningful aspects of our RIA experience. Ameritrade advisors already participate in our flagship industry events, including IMPACT. They've started to benefit from our leading business consulting offer, including participating in our annual benchmarking study and the executive leadership program.  And we've included them in our RIA industry advocacy programs while also giving them access to resources like our strategy desk which educates advisors on how to use various option strategies through one-on-one consultations as well as our block desk, which helps advisors to optimize their best execution process. And as we look to Labor Day weekend, preparations for conversion are well underway and advisors are engaged. 80% of firms who only custody with Ameritrade have already begun to credentialize themselves. Over 20,000 Veo One users have accessed Schwab Advisor Center to test drive our platform.  Over 5,000 firms to date have attended at least one educational webinar session. And we are spending this summer helping firms get familiar with our technology, our investment offerings and our people, so they are ready to do business at Schwab after Labor Day weekend. And after conversion, all advisors will enjoy the full benefits of our combined offer, a custodial platform that is designed to help RIAs of all sizes grow and succeed. Schwab advisers will benefit from award-winning platforms and capabilities like thinkpipes, iRebal and for Model Market Center technology. And Schwab Advisor Center will incorporate Veo One's most popular features and functionality. Ameritrade advisors will have access to the breadth of Schwab's offer, including Schwab Charitable and Schwab Bank. We believe there will never have been a stronger custodial offer in the market than coming out of the conversion weekend. Turning now to win-win monetization. Clients are continuing to come to Schwab for advice and we've seen strong flows in our full-service wealth programs and our managed investing solutions. Schwab Wealth Advisory had $5.9 billion in net flows for the first half of 2023 and an increase of 89% compared to last year. And notably, some of these inflows are being driven by a meaningful increase in flows from existing advisory clients, which combined with a strong Client Promoter Score, demonstrates the value clients see in the offer. It is also worth noting that 20% of flows in the Schwab Wealth Advisory in the first half of the year were from Ameritrade FCs. Validating our belief that there is a large untapped demand among Ameritrade clients for more help and advice, a significant asset and retention opportunity, which we are excited to capture in the years ahead. Client interest in the Wasmer Schroeder Strategies continues to be strong with $2.8 billion in net flows for the first half of the year. In just a few years, Wasmer Schroeder Strategies have gone from 0% to 31% of our managed account solutions assets at Schwab. This clearly demonstrates our ability to drive win-win monetization as clients have benefited from lower cost fixed income strategies than they had previously and we are benefiting from outsized flows in fixed income. Ameritrade clients migrating to Schwab are showing appetite for our advice offers. When we look at net flows into our managed investing solutions year-to-date, more than $280 million came from legacy Ameritrade clients after they migrated to Schwab.  Finally, we continue to build on our Schwab Personalized Indexing offer. In June, we rolled out a new experience for our RIA clients and gave them more flexibility to tailor their clients' Schwab Personalized Indexing portfolios. Advisors are also now able to digitally onboard their clients into our direct indexing offer and have access to a new digital dashboard that highlights the performance of each account. Turning now to client segmentation. Just last week, we launched two new branded client experiences to meet the unique needs of our retail self-directed clients with more than $1 million and those with more than $10 million in assets. The new experience for clients with $1 million to $10 million is called Schwab Private Client Services and the experience for our $10 million-plus clients is Schwab Private Wealth Services.  Our goal is to meet the needs of these clients across several key dimensions, relationships, service, operations, product and price. The differentiated experiences will include access to a dedicated Schwab consultant who can help them manage their financial life, access to dedicated service teams, access to a range of wealth management specialists, discounted mortgage pricing, special client events and more. Our high net worth clients already represent more than two-thirds of our retail client assets. And as you can see on this page, they also represent the areas where we have the greatest growth potential as these are our fastest-growing retail segments. Meeting the needs of key client segments as we are doing with these new experiences, will continue to support our long-term asset growth. We've spent quite a bit of time in this forum talking about the opportunities for growth that we see ahead. I've described in some detail how our strengths have positioned Schwab to sustain an organic growth rate of 5% to 7% over the long term by attracting new assets from existing clients and attracting new clients to Schwab. These strengths include a client base that is in the peak of wealth accumulation. Dedicated relationships, our commitment to RIA growth, our brand, our acquisition model and our workplace pipeline. As Walt shared earlier, our 2023 year-to-date organic growth rate remains in this consistent range, north of 5%, and we are well positioned for this to continue. As we've shared in prior quarters, we have an attractive $3.5 billion to $4 billion revenue opportunity ahead in wealth management as we increase advice penetration among retail clients and grow our lending offer for all clients. I'll wrap up where Walt started. Our Through Clients' Eyes strategy remains our North Star. With clients at the forefront of every decision we make, we are successfully delivering on a historic integration while making progress on our strategic focus areas. At the same time, we are adhering to the financial discipline that is the hallmark of our all-weather business model by identifying opportunities for cost savings and efficiencies that will allow us to reinvest in our clients and reward our stockholders. With this approach, we are on track to harness the tremendous long-term growth opportunities that lie ahead.  And with that, I will turn it over to Peter. So I would say that we have lots of opportunity in driving advice penetration. And the reason being that -- our clients are increasingly looking to us for advice. They want help and guidance in all measures where we survey clients. They're asking for more help and guidance, and we'd like certainly for Schwab clients to turn to us for help and guidance.  We want to provide what they need. We've done a lot to try to bolster our offerings, and I'll share a few things. The first thing we've done is we've taken our proprietary Schwab Wealth Advisory offering, which is our wealth full-service wealth management offer to clients, and we've invested in it tremendously in the past couple of years. And we've seen the returns to that. As you can see by the 90% increase in flows -- 89% increase in net flows that we reported as well as the really strong Client Promoter Scores that we consistently earn in that offer. So the investments have been paying off, and we've seen an acceleration of growth there. And as I mentioned earlier, a lot of it has come from Ameritrade clients who didn't have access to a program like this previously that are now turning towards it. So that is all encouraging. We also, as you are aware, bought Wasmer Schroeder a few years ago, we're seeing just tremendous growth in the fixed income space for clients that want help and guidance there. And then we are encouraged by what we're seeing in Schwab Personalized Indexing.  We believe 5, 10 years from now, taxable assets that will be the primary location that clients save or invest in taking share from ETFs over time. And we're at the forefront of that, driving down the cost for clients to participate in that as well as the minimum asset tax. We've democratized access to personalized investing, which is very much in line with our heritage. And then finally, what I would say is our SAN program, our Schwab Advisor Network program continues to grow. And gain really strong flows on our platform. We want to make sure clients have access to whatever help and guidance they need, whether it's a Schwab proprietary offer or something through our advisor network, and we continue to see robust flows there. The combination of all that is growing at Schwab, and it's also growing among Ameritrade clients. So we think the future is really bright in wealth. We've invested a lot in it. And thankfully, we're seeing the returns to those investments, both at Schwab and among our Ameritrade clients. Yes. We've got some exciting developments on the lending side. One of the things we're thrilled to do is launch a digital Pledged Asset Line experience here during the month of July to our advisers, and we anticipate that will be among the easiest and fastest pledge asset line experience in the industry. We'll do the same in retail. We'll follow with retail. And there's a number of other things we've done on the lending side to make it easier for our higher net worth clients to get a mortgage through Schwab. We've also done things you've seen. I'm sure with our investor advantage pricing, which makes taking the loan through Schwab if you're a client and have assets with us, again, among the lowest cost places to get a loan. So we see the opportunity for meaningful growth here. Lending environment clearly is challenging. So we're not seeing the returns to those investments just yet that we might otherwise have seen.  But what's important is we are laying the foundation for when the lending environment is appealing more and more clients will turn to Schwab for their lending because we've made it easier, we've made it more seamless, we've made it even less costly, and there should be no better place to take a Pledged Asset Line or a mortgage than through your relationship here at Schwab. So we feel confident that when the lending environment improves, we're going to be there."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the 2023 Schwab Winter Business Update. I'm Jeff Edwards, Head of Investor Relations. For our long-time listeners that were expecting to see Mr. Fowler, I can confidently say that I did reach him on his bat phone this morning, somewhere in his bunker in Northern California. It is a top-down day now that we've finally gotten through that atmospheric river. We have a very exciting day for you today to talk about the Schwab story. We have, hopefully, to many of you are very familiar have interacted with over time in person, but maybe over the last couple of years here, we've been a part maybe you've only seen virtually. So we're looking forward to it. The agenda is very similar to years past. Walt will kick us off and as well followed by Mr. Rick Wurster, our President; Joe Martinetto, aka Professor Martinetto, will follow and talk a little bit about the Ameritrade conversion and some of the updates on technology. We'll then do a double-click into the business with Jonathan, Stacy and Bernie join us to talk a little bit about wealth and advice. And then finally, Mr. Peter Crawford, CFO, will finish the day and beyond. Now that we're back in person, it's important to kind of revisit our Q&A etiquette. We will still be taking questions over the web console for those of you that are joining us virtually today. For those here in the room, we will be doing our mic runners. Grayson down here you see coming down the aisle, so please raise your hands, we'd ask that you wait for them to bring you a mic before asking your question. Similar to the recent updates, we'll be doing the one question, no follow-up. However, we will be coming back around so that there is ample opportunity for everybody to ask hopefully multiple questions to make sure you get all those questions answered. For everybody, virtually, please go to the web console. Ms. Lauren Gaspar will be helping me collect those. So let's be nice as we send those across. And if anything comes up, please hesitate to reach out to the IR team with any questions or concerns. Finally, everyone's favorite slide of the day, the wall of words. It simply reminds us that our disclosures can change and evolve over time, so please stay in touch. With that, I would like to transition to our Co-Chairman and CEO, Mr. Walt Bettinger.\nWalter Bettinger : Good morning, everyone. It's hard to believe that it's been three years since we were together in person. I think we squeezed this in right before the pandemic. I'm actually dealing today with a non-COVID cold. When I describe a cold, of course, now I have to make sure that it is non-COVID-related, but my voice is a little bit off. If I start to lose my voice, I guess I'll have less to say and maybe that will be a blessing for everyone given my use of a lot of words. But it is wonderful to be with all with you today, and we're looking forward to an exciting day of interaction. So we often talk about our all-weather business model at Schwab and the ability for us to generate strong, powerful results throughout different time frames. And I think if you look back at '21 and '22, you see that illustrated perfectly in the last two years. So in 2021, you had an extraordinary year for equity markets and we dealt with near-record low interest rates, and we delivered record financial results. When you flip over to 2022, you had a near-record year in terms of equity market pain or difficulty. And then we had some of the rapidest increases in interest rates that we've experienced. And we delivered record financial results. And I hope that as I go through my time today, it helps paint that long-term picture. The way we manage the business, the way we think about the business, the way we execute on the business strategy is to deliver those kind of results throughout all different environments, all different cycles that you can count on a long-term perspective. We're going to touch on each of these topics in my section, both our ability to deliver growth consistently through all forms of economic environments as well as return capital during certain periods, such as the one that we're in right now. I'll touch briefly on the Ameritrade conversion, although Joe Martinetto, of course, will go into that in much more detail. And then also I'll touch on how important it is that in our business, we have aligned the areas of significant investment around places in the market where I think we all agree and research shows are the fastest growing. So I mentioned earlier about 2022. We all know it well. No need to necessarily go through the charts and the math. But we know it was a very, very difficult year for our clients, a difficult year for investors. You had both, of course, equity markets and bond markets experiencing tough periods. And not surprising, when you get that type of environment, investors feel it. And so they operated in a bear environment from a mentality standpoint, a sentiment standpoint, throughout almost the entire year. And then, of course, as the year moved forward, we saw greater intensity in terms of yields and flipping with the long-term rates and short-term rates. So we inverted. Through the years though, our clients remain very heavily engaged with us. So we delivered almost $430 billion in net new assets during the year. Interestingly, our clients remained buyers during the years so despite their bare sentiment, there was optimism in terms of being net buyers. Processed about 6 million trades a year, and clients continue to enroll in our advisory offers during 2022. This is a really important slide as I talk about the long-term perspective of the company. We often describe that when you invest in Schwab, you invest in a growth story, and you invest in a growth story that thrives throughout every different type of economic environment. So this slide shares net new assets in -- going back to 2011 and how we are consistently able to deliver within that 5% to 7% range no matter what's going on with the equity markets. Actually '21, we are a bit over. If you look down at the footnotes, you'll notice that we're only including Ameritrade from, I believe, 2020 forward when we got the closing. So actually, if you were to layer Ameritrade on there pre-2020, you would see even stronger numbers in terms of net new assets. But what's important is the consistency, the consistency of our ability to deliver for our clients so that they then turn around and deliver for us in bringing assets into the firm. Now why did they do that? Well, this slide, I think, helps paint some of the pictures. So we refer to it as Client Promoter Score. Of course, many people refer to it as Net Promoter Score. And you can see results across our various parts of the firm. Investor Services at 64. And of course, these are world-class-type NPS numbers for those of you who follow the NPS world. Managed investing dipped a bit in the fourth quarter. But as Neesha will share with you later, 22 of the past 24 quarters, clients who pay us for advice actually had higher Net Promoter or Client Promoter Scores than our self-directed retap clients. So although it dipped a bit, not surprising with equity markets, they are a very happy client. Easy score of 92, and then 83% of our client interactions with one of our representatives resulted in the clients giving us a perfect score, the highest score they could possibly offer us. So underlying facts behind that very consistent ability to grow and deliver net new assets. Of course we receive plenty of industry accolades. I won\u2019t spend much time on this. We will hear some more about additional ones of these before long, but they provide some additional boost I suppose, to consumer evaluation. And of course, when you have that kind of consistent organic growth, consistent new asset flows, it puts you in a position to deliver consistent strong financial results, and here you can just see revenue and net income, pre-tax profit margin and diluted EPS again over the last handful of years. Yes, again, over the last handful of years. We tried to go back in this session today and cover a bit more historically because it has been the three years since we year since we were together so normally these would be the things we would be sharing every year, only looking back a year or two, but I thought it was important this time to go a little further back and just reinforce the consistency of our performance. So we like to say at Schwab, it's all about the conversion, but it's also all about a whole series of other things. But we are about to begin the formal conversion here within a couple of weeks. We're very, very excited about that. I know many of the Ameritrade clients are also very excited. We're also really pleased at the response from the clients as we've reached out to them and begun our first transition group here over the next couple of weeks. And we know that this is a big, complicated conversion. No one has ever converted a brokerage business anywhere near this size or scale in the history of our industry, but we feel very confident about where we are. Our test results are late have been delivering the 99.9% accuracy. We don't expect it to be perfect. We try to be very realistic about that. But we do remain quite confident that overall will be a wonderful experience. And when it all is said and done, the clients at both former Schwab as well as the former Ameritrade will have better experience, better tools, better capabilities than either one has had before. So I talked about our consistent ability to deliver results, but I want to just take a step back and again go through why we think that's possible. As you can see on the left side of the slide, we really believe at Schwab that we operate with some structural advantages within our industry, and we look to leverage those structural advantages to better serve clients and better reward our stockholders. Size and scale, relatively unparalleled, certainly within the public company environment. Operating efficiency, we are huge believers that the low-cost provider is the ultimate winner, particularly if being the low-cost provider doesn't involve trade-offs to be able to be in that position. Our service culture, again, I think goes without saying, but everyone is well aware of the quality of our service, our consistency. Look at 2022 for example. We averaged answering the phone last year in about 30 seconds on the Schwab Blue side and about 11 seconds on the TD Ameritrade Green side. Of course, those will come together as we do this conversion. But we answer the phone, we serve our clients, we're there for them. Our branches have been open for several years, and we're ready to serve our clients, and we know that they have a good experience when they interact with us. We have a very efficient operating structure. We don't have [fiefdoms] at Schwab. We have a One Schwab mentality in which everything is about the client. Everything revolves around the client. We work in partnership. We work closely together. We compensate all of our people based on doing the right thing. If you go into a branch and you speak with one of our reps, whether they're talking with the client about a Schwab solution around advisory or working with an RIA, we compensate them in a similar manner. If they're talking about looking at investing in a fund, whether it's a fund run by Schwab or a fund run by a third party, maybe even a third party who provides us no shareholder servicing, we compensate our reps in the same way. We try to structure an operating model which is efficient both for stockholders but also serves our clients well and minimizes the potential for conflicts. Of course, our brand and our corporate reputation ties in with our willingness to disrupt. We have been a consistent disruptor on behalf of our clients, and you should expect that to continue in the future. Let me just go back for one second and touch on two other items here. I mentioned about the and, and it's so important, particularly in terms of being a low-cost provider. We look to not ask our clients to make trade-offs. There's no reason they. Great people across technology and digital experiences and so on, all the way down. And our virtuous cycle also continue at play. You can see it rolling all the way back to our decision to broadly eliminate commission back in 2019 and how it's carried forward to today as we're able to reward out stockholders, and also reward our clients. And of course, you saw the latest example of that yesterday, coming out of our Board meeting where we substantially increased our dividend now up to $0.25 per quarter. As I come down the end of my prepared comments, I just wanted to touch again on the way we think about strategy at Schwab. Everything sits with an overlaying what is going to be best for our clients. At the same time, we identify long-term industry trends. For those of you who have been with me for a long time as we've had these meetings, I would periodically provide to you a list of trends that we viewed were going to be critical in the coming years and how they would shape our strategy. And of course, that continues today. You can see our view on broad trends, client views and the competitive landscape. I just want to emphasize that the two fastest-growing areas in our industry are self-directed investing and the RIA world. And of course, our positioning in both of those spaces, we consider as absolutely optimal. So we have tremendous optimism about our future and our ability to continue to deliver the type of consistent organic growth that you've seen from us and that I shared in the prior charts. So let me just go ahead and wrap up here real quickly, just again emphasizing the consistency of our strategy through clients' eyes. 2022, another record year. We're very excited about 2023. We know it's going to be a transition year. We're going to be doing the largest conversion in the history of our industry. We know that we're dealing with still a somewhat challenging environment for our clients. So we know it's going to be a transition year, but we think it sets us up also very, very well for 2024 and 2025, consistent with the long-term perspective that we have at Schwab. So again, thank you for the opportunity to share with all of you. It is wonderful to be together after three years. And Rick Wurster, a great friend and our President, is going to come up and share some comments. And then I'll rejoin Rick for a Q&A with all of you after Rick has finished his slides. Thank you again. Look forward to our Q&A.\nRichard Wurster : Hello, everyone. Welcome to Westlake. It's nice to see so many of you in person. One of the questions I'm often asked by analysts is, can we sustain the healthy levels of organic growth that we've delivered historically now that we're a much larger company? So I'm going to talk about that topic in two parts today. I'm going to talk about what we can rely upon from our virtuous cycle, which we think is the ability to continue that growth. And then secondly, I'm going to talk about our strategic focus areas and the role they can play in accelerating both our organic growth and our revenue. We're in a position of strength today. With over $7 trillion of client assets, we are the leading provider of investing in wealth management capabilities of any publicly traded firm in the United States. And as Walt just mentioned, our growth is supported by the fact that we're focused on the two fastest-growing segments of our market. Underlying our growth is our combination of value, service and choice. You see that in the retail channel, the ability to walk into our branch to call our 24/7 line or to deal with our outstanding digital experiences, all with products and services priced at great value. In the RIA space, we provide unmatched practice support. We provide unmatched custodial experiences in terms of our digital and technology capabilities that we provide to RIAs at custody with us. And all of that comes with a commitment to no custody fees for RIAs of any size. And in workplace, it's about our solid platforms that are supported by our industry-leading service. You add that all up, and we have a healthy greater than 1.5 TOA ratio. Now for those that have been covering the company for a while, you may recall us reporting numbers closer to 2. And you can rest assured that our Schwab numbers remain at those levels. But I also want to anchor you to the new numbers that we'll report going forward, which are the integrated Ameritrade and Schwab numbers, still a healthy greater than 1.5. And I also want to provide some context for why Ameritrade has historically had lower TOA. What happens with Ameritrade is clients have been attracted to Ameritrade for their trading capabilities. They bring cash in, ready to execute a trade. They grow their wealth over time with Ameritrade. And at some point, their needs change and they want more full service wealth management support. And so they take some portion of those assets or all of those assets and they TOA them out to a fuller service firm. And so the assets come in, in cash and TOA out in securities, creating a lower TOA ratio. So that's why as we report our TOA ratio going forward, you should expect it to be closer to the 1.5 than the 2 that you've seen from Schwab historically. But therein lies an opportunity. Those clients that have come to Ameritrade to trade that have built wealth there, we're going to expose them to our relationship model. We're going to make available our broader wealth support, and we're going to try to keep as many of those clients in the Schwab family as possible because we know when they're at Schwab, they don't have to make any trade-offs. We have a strong market share today with 12% market share, but there's still lots of room for growth for many years to come. The virtuous cycle has been what has driven our growth over time. Walt has said for many years, if we do right by clients, if we see through their eyes, clients will do more business with us. And this is proof that, that approach has worked. When you look back over the long run, we have consistently delivered 3% to 5% of organic growth from our existing clients. That's our existing clients choosing to do more business with us because we've done right by them. Whether it's them investing their dividends and interest with us, we're bringing their hard-earned savings to invest for the future. We've reliably generated that 3% to 5% from existing clients. We've also been able to attract 2% to 3% of organic growth from clients new to the firm. You add that all up, and it's the 5% to 7% growth Walt shared earlier that we consistently and reliably delivered. So now I want to take a moment and talk about why we're confident that we can continue to drive that growth from our virtuous cycle in the future. And it starts with existing clients. Our client base is young and getting younger. Our average client age is under 50, and 57% of our clients that came in new to Schwab last year were under 40 years old. That puts them squarely in the accumulation stage of their life, meaning they're going to need to contribute more assets to save for their future. The other element driving our future growth from existing clients is dedicated relationships. We know that when we have a dedicated relationship with a client, that client is a more engaged client. They have higher Client Promoter Scores, greater satisfaction and as a result, higher retention, and they bring us more net new assets. In fact, they bring us 2.5x more net new assets than those that did not have a relationship. And we continue to invest in and expand the number of clients at Schwab that have that dedicated relationship fueling our future growth. And then third, in our RIA business, as the RIAs who custody with us have success in growing their businesses and as their existing clients bring them assets, that's fuel for our organic growth. So you can see from this that we feel like we're in a really good position if we see through clients' eyes to sustain our level of organic growth from existing clients. In terms of new clients, our recipe is what it's always been. It's about our brand, putting clients first. It's about being a trusted financial services provider as we have been for the past 50 years. It's about our diversified acquisition model. It's about our sales teams, our marketing efforts, referrals, being able to walk into a branch. It all attracts clients to Schwab. It's our workplace pipeline, a business that's an increasingly strategic for us and one that should bring new clients to Schwab. And then finally, it's our commitment to the RIA industry. As more advisors choose to go independent, as the leading provider of custodial services, that will fuel our growth. So we think, as we look forward, we're a much bigger company. This shows -- this to us is evidence that the virtuous cycle will continue to drive that 5% to 7% of organic growth that we've seen historically far into the future even as a much larger company. I want to now pivot to talk about our strategic focus areas and the acceleration they can provide both to organic growth and to our revenue. We've talked a lot about the benefits of the Ameritrade acquisition. It's clear, it's the expense synergies, we've been clear about. The enhancements to our clients, we've been clear about. Our clients are really going to benefit from bringing the best of Ameritrade and Schwab to them, both in the advisor, channel and in our retail business. One of the things I'm particularly excited about is the runway of growth that Ameritrade will provide to us. At Schwab, we have a little more than 50% share of our clients' assets here with us at Schwab. That's 1.5x the share of wallet at Ameritrade. Many of my Ameritrade colleagues will say to me, we're #1 at being #2. And what Ameritrade meant by that was that their clients tended to have a primary financial relationship. And then they would have some of their trading assets with Ameritrade, but they always had that primary relationship. As we introduce clients to our relationship model, our broader set of capabilities, our advice, our financial planning, we believe we can move into that primary financial relationship position and grow our share of wallet with Ameritrade clients. And if we can do that, that's a more than $0.5 trillion of net new asset opportunity for us. And importantly, it's clients that stay in the Schwab family and benefit from all that we have to offer. So it's a real win for clients and it's a win for us. I want to now talk about wealth. I'd like to [say] market for advice. And you can see that on the left-hand side of this page, more investors are willing to pay for advice. We have a really strong wealth platform today. Neesha's going to describe it in a lot more detail later. She'll also describe the enhancements we're making to take what's a strong platform and make it even better for clients. We see room to grow here. 19% of retail assets at Schwab are in an advice solution. As Walt talked about earlier, those consistently -- those clients consistently have our highest Client Promoter Scores and are among our most satisfied clients. They're also ones that were helping along their financial journey and making a real difference in their financial life, fulfilling our mission as a company. You'll also notice on this page that only 7% of Ameritrade assets are an advice solution. We see opportunity to grow both of these numbers, and we also see an opportunity to close that gap between the 19% and the 7% as we introduce the breadth of advice capabilities that we have at Schwab to our Ameritrade clients. For each 1% we can move the needle, first of all, it's more clients that we're helping and making a real difference in their financial life, most importantly. And in addition to that, it's $125 million to $200 million of annual revenue. I want to now talk about direct indexing. Direct indexing is a capability that we think over time will take share from both mutual funds and ETFs. It's a capability that we think to be a market leader is going to take 3 success criteria. We think it will take being a leading indexer. It will take strong digital capabilities because in order to personalize the portfolio, it's going to have to be done in part digitally. And we think it's going to take relationships. And we think it's going to take relationships because many clients aren't aware of the benefits of personalized indexing today. So that one-to-one discussion about how it may benefit an individual client is going to be really important. As we think about those three characteristics, indexing capabilities, digital capabilities and relationships, we believe there is no firm better positioned than Schwab to be a market leader. And as we're a market leader, there's a number of benefits that will accrue to our clients. Over the long run, they should be able to achieve better after-tax returns. And they should be able to personalize their portfolio in a way that meets their needs and allows them to commit to their portfolios for the long term, helping drive better financial outcomes. It's also a space where we can bring our no trade-offs approach and our value orientation to clients and helping make a real difference in their lives. I want to now talk about lending. Lending is an area we've been focused on doing more. And it started with our preferred rate program that we've introduced in the past few years, something that's been very well received by clients as those clients that keep assets with us have been able to access industry-leading interest rates. We've also invested in the past couple of years in making the experience of taking a loan or a poll at Schwab easier to accomplish. This is an area where we think we have more room to grow. Clients come to us for the asset side of their balance sheet. But today, only 0.6% of client assets are in a lending solution. So far fewer are coming to us for the liability side of their balance sheet. And that presents us with an opportunity, an opportunity to do more for the client, to integrate their financial life, to give them a more holistic view of their financial life so that we can help them along the way to their financial dreams. And if we do that, if we can deliver in that way for clients, you'll see for us, we've had 0.6% of total assets in lending solutions. When we look at our peers, that number is about 3.5%. If we can close that gap and do more for clients, that's a $1.5 billion to $2 billion of annualized incremental revenue that we could accrue at Schwab. But again, it's also, we think, happier clients because we know the clients that do have both a lending and investing relationship with us are happier clients and also have higher retention, stay with us longer. I want to now talk about our third strategic focus area, client segmentation, and I want to focus on two segments in particular. First, I want to focus on traders. And you can see from the metrics on the page that the trading segment is a very valuable segment to us, which is why we continue to invest to make sure that the strength of our combined trading platform and the thinkorswim platform that we're bringing on from Ameritrade continue to shine. So we're investing in thinkorswim. We offer differentiated service for our trading clients, and we have an outstanding trading education group, which provides education to traders of all skill levels, helping them to be as successful as possible. On the right-hand side of the page, you'll see our efforts with higher-net-worth clients, an area where we are competitively strong as you can see with our 2x TOA ratio with wirehouses, which is where we tend to compete for these clients. This is an area we've invested in over the past few years, and we'll continue to invest. We've invested in differentiated service experiences, differentiated product to meet the unique needs of higher-net-worth clients and differentiated wealth advice to help clients in that wealth bracket to meet some of the challenges that they may face, all with the goal of making them better off in their financial life. So I'm going to wrap up with where I started. The question I'm most commonly asked by analysts is, can we sustain the level of organic growth that we've driven historically and that Walt shared with you earlier? And the answer from us is a resounding yes. Yes, we can. It starts with the virtuous cycle, driving 3% to 5% of new organic growth from our existing clients and 2% to 3% from new clients. And we can accelerate that via organic growth through the opportunity with Ameritrade that I described earlier and a $2 billion to $4 billion-plus revenue opportunity through both wealth and lending. And it all starts with seeing through clients' eyes. When we see it through clients' eyes and do right by them, that leads to enhanced growth and sustains what you've seen from us historically. And with that, Walt and I are looking forward to taking your questions.\nQ - Brennan Hawken : Brennan Hawken from UBS. Rick, I'd love to start where you just finished, actually. So you laid out several growth opportunities, and you quantified two of them. What sort of time frame do you think you would expect for both the advice -- bridging the gap on the advice side and on the lending opportunity? And then more broadly, what do you -- where do you think is going to be the biggest impact to drive the growth in the next few years?\nRichard Wurster : I would say, first, it's going to take time. This isn't going to happen overnight. We already have a very strong wealth business that is growing. You'll hear from Neesha later the investments that we're making for the long term. So we see it as a long-term opportunity there. On the lending side, we've done a lot to enhance our capabilities in the past few years. As the lending -- it's going to take those capabilities, which we think are ready for growth, but also probably a different lending environment. And when the confluence of those two things happen, I think you'll see an acceleration in our client lending activity.\nMichael Cyprys : Mike Cyprys, Morgan Stanley. Just a question on scale. You guys have mentioned in the past that scale is going to play a major role and determining the industry's winner. So I guess a two-part question here is, do you feel you have sufficient scale at this point? And if you look across your businesses, where would you say you have sufficient scale versus where might you have more work to do? And how do you ensure you continue to have sufficient scale in 5 years' time? And then the second part is, how do you think about the role of technology and software to potentially reduce or replicate the benefits of scale over time?\nWalter Bettinger : Yes. So certainly, I think in the retail side and the advisor side, we have a very, very powerful scale. We would probably be 1 or 2 on the retail side if you incorporate non-public companies. And of course, 1, if you look at public and from a purpose-built platform for RIA custodian, I think we would likely be considered a very strong #1. We have more opportunity in the workplace environment where we have a very strong approach in 401(k) with both a bundled and an unbundled approach and then in the equity comp side, but there's probably more opportunity there to expand scale. Those are often more corporate- or company-driven decisions as opposed to the investor side and the advisor side. I think technology is definitely going to play a role. But to me, if what you're really getting at, Michael, is the idea that someone could leverage technology to make a leap above others in scale, I don't envision that because we're all investing in technology to drive all of our costs down. So as we would evaluate our scale position, technology is going to help those who are less subscale to us, but it's also going to help us and is helping us. And so the relative efficiency of businesses is likely, I think, to continue to be there as we all make meaningful technology and digital investments. The other thing that I think is important in that is that our business model, although it has a significant part that relies on relationship, also has a very significant part that is less relationship-oriented. And so if we're competing against firms that have the majority of their revenue driven off interpersonal relationships, there's only so much scale that can be driven from that because of the compensation for those individuals. Good question. Good long-term perspective thinking. Thanks, Michael.\nRichard Repetto : Rich Repetto, Piper Sandler. First, congratulations, Walt, on the co-Chairman since we last saw you, a great honor. And it's great to meet you and hear from you. So I guess when we last got together, we didn't have -- zero commissions were just coming in. We got app Robin Hood, we get -- now we got much higher interest rates. A lot of different moving pieces. And you get the Ameritrade integration come up. So I guess my question is, am I just -- is it just me, but it just seems like there's more variables and factors, whether we go into recession, but you've dealt with a market that has pulled back. Do we have more variables when we look at the retail investor over the next year to two years, especially when you're dealing with the biggest integration that the industry has gone through? And one of the guiding factors that's sort of [indiscernible] as you go through. And I suspect I know that you answered a little bit to that.\nWalter Bettinger : Yes. I mean I think in the short run, you have more variables because we've had such a tremendous swing in interest rates, right, from a ZIRP world to the most rapid increases in rates that we've ever experienced. We went from an incredibly strong equity market in 2021 to 2022. But that's all short term. I think when we flip it around and look at the long-term perspective, I really don't think things have changed that much. Investors still need to plan for their future. They're still saving for retirement. They're still saving to put children through college, providing for other family members. All those factors remain the same. And I think what is important over the three years since we've been together in person is, the strength of our franchise has only grown as we've made investments, as we've leveraged our capabilities, as we are bringing together Schwab and Ameritrade, our offering to clients and prospective clients has never been stronger. So sure, short term, from a financial standpoint, there's more volatility. But from a long-term standpoint, clients are going to returning to Schwab for their needs, I think we're better positioned than ever to deal with them. And I think even long term, financially, we're in a better position, again, illustrated in 2021 and 2022. So 2021, the trading aspect of Ameritrade really helped lift our revenue and helped us, in a ZIRP world, deliver record results. And then it turned in 2022 where trading was a bit softer than in 2021, but as rates start to move up, the Schwab part of the economic model really kicked in and helped us deliver record results. So again, I agree, Rich, short term, we see volatility. Long term, we really like our positioning. And we think the combined Schwab-Ameritrade also delivers a lot of benefits financially for our stockholders.\nUnidentified Analyst: Clearly, attractive TAMs, lots of growth runway. I think one of the questions that comes to mind is how you're going to tackle some of the hurdles if we think about direct indexing, for example, delivering that -- those tax efficiencies at a lower asset threshold? Ameritrade clients more active on the trader side may not be as receptive to a wealth product. And lastly, as the Schwab, you think of self-direct RIA maybe not as lending platform. So I was hoping you could address some of the hurdles to delivering on some of those growth plans.\nRichard Wurster : Sure. Do you mind -- just go through the 3 again because I want to make sure I hit all 3.\nUnidentified Analyst: Direct indexing, advice, lending.\nWalter Bettinger : So let me start with direct indexing. I think on direct indexing, the big opportunity in the near term is with higher-balance clients. And the reason that, that's where the opportunity is, is because the tax impact at direct indexing has the biggest impact on those clients. And so we came out at $100,000 minimum, which the big direct indexes were at a $250,000 minimum. So we think that was a disruptive move and brings a lot more clients into the fold who can benefit from the tax benefits. I think that as we move forward, as this space evolves, I do think the minimums will come down. And I think the primary reason for that will be the desire for personalization because I think what you'll find is the lower-balance client -- the idea that you want personalization will appeal to any wealth level. Now there's some people at wealthier levels that may have concentrated positions. And you can do some really interesting things for wealthy clients in building a more personalized index portfolio because if you have a lot of exposure to Schwab stock, you could build an index that not only takes out Schwab but is built from a factor standpoint to be almost the opposite of Schwab so that you can, with your Schwab stock, get back to the index level performance and think about it holistically. So there's a lot you can do for wealthy clients, but also for less wealthy clients. So I do think the minimums will come down over time, and we've been building our capabilities to be able to do that in terms of our fractional share capabilities. Just more work to be done, but I think the industry will move in that direction over time. I just don't think it's important to do so today. We're at a phase where we're still educating that first wave of movers and those are going to be our higher-net-worth clients, and that's where we want to keep our focus. On the advice side and the Ameritrade, I'd say a couple of things. I mean, I think it goes back to the -- what I mentioned earlier that Ameritrade colleagues will tell me they were #1, being #2. So most of their clients that came to Ameritrade for trading actually had full-service wealth advice relationships. They just weren't with Ameritrade. So it's clear to us that there is interest among the client base. And I would just say, 10 or 15 years ago, people used to say similar things about Schwab. You probably won't be able to grow advice. People come to you for transactional reasons. And of course, it's grown markedly over the last 10 to 15 years. And I think our Ameritrade clients are in a similar position. So we are confident. And we've already seen the benefits. I mean, I think 46% of our Ameritrade financial consultants have already opened an account in Schwab Wealth Advisory, which is a pretty remarkable number given they're not even fully Schwab -- embedded in Schwab yet. And they've had some higher hurdles to overcome to introduce that to their clients in a Schwab financial consultant. So that's a pretty remarkable number. So we see a lot of promise there. And then on the lending side, I can't remember the challenge you mentioned, but do you mind reiterating the challenge you saw on the lending side?\nUnidentified Analyst: I think it's more that Schwab clients don't necessarily view you guys as a lender. In terms of like top of mind, what are the products that you offer? Certainly lending is not where it -- at least, what first comes to mind.\nRichard Wurster : Yes. Well, that's the opportunity for us, and we've introduced the ability for our relationship people. So Schwab Wealth Advisory for the first time is now able to talk to clients about their -- the lending side of their balance sheet. And it's a focus of the branch network, which Jonathan will talk about. So there's -- we have every reason to believe that we can engage more with clients on the lending side. It hasn't been an area of huge focus in the past for a whole lot of good reasons, but there is an opportunity there in the future. And the reaction to what we've done so far has been quite strong. And when you see client engagement with our lower -- with our interest rate program, which has really lowered the cost of lending for our clients to keep balances with us -- it's been very positive thing with clients. And you see it in our Client Promoter Scores that have both the asset and liability side with us, you see it in the retention numbers. It's stickier relationships.\nWalter Bettinger : One real quick thing on the lending side, I completely agree with what Rick said. I want to go back to being a low-cost provider. So in virtually every type of market environment may be other than one where you have ultra-high interest rates, our cost of deposits is less than almost everyone. And so when you combine a most efficient operating model with the lowest cost of deposits, puts us in a position to be able to offer very disruptive lending rates to our clients in what is, for many ways, a commodity-oriented product, borrowing. And so we're in a position, I think, over time to be quite disruptive with the lending rates we can offer clients and yet still generate for us incremental revenue on a spread to securities basis. So we have a pricing opportunity there that I think you'll see us taking advantage of given our low cost of deposits and our low operating model.\nBenjamin Budish : Ben Budish from Barclays. I wanted to follow up on what you were sort of talking about -- with Ameritrade and earlier in the presentation, you mentioned an opportunity to kind of gain wallet share. I was wondering if you could drill down in that a little bit more. Are there certain -- you mentioned a lot of Ameritrade clients might use Ameritrade for trading but have a separate wealth management or advisory relationship. Is it simply a matter of sort of getting the advisory piece as well or are there other types of assets that you could bring over, things like 401(k)s or IRAs, just other kind of products said you could kind of point and click, move over? If you could just kind of drill down on that a little bit.\nWalter Bettinger : Do want to take that or do you want me to...\nRichard Wurster : No. Go ahead, please.\nWalter Bettinger : Well, I would say our plan for doing that starts with building a relationship with them. And our -- the work we've done with our financial consultants and what we've brought to our clients in terms of advice, I think, is going to be the model for what we do with our Ameritrade clients. The Ameritrade relationship model has been a bit more service-oriented and a bit more trading-oriented because that's what clients came to Ameritrade for, and that's what made sense. And the journey we've been over the last 10 to 15 years, again, 15 years ago, there might have been some of that in the branches as well at Schwab. And we've turned the relationship much more into a wealth management relationship, where we're helping the client with all aspects of their financial life. And so as we do that and as we follow that playbook with our Ameritrade clients, we think will unearth all kinds of opportunities. There are full-service wealth business that may be elsewhere, they're 401(k) that may be elsewhere. But it starts from, to the client, how can we help you achieve your financial dreams? Let's look at your picture today, let's look at where you need to get to, and let's talk about the breadth of capabilities that we now have collectively at Schwab and Ameritrade that can help you get there.\nChristian Bolu : Christian Bolu, Autonomous. So just on the competitive landscape, your growth -- organic growth of 5% to 7% has -- over the last decade has definitely been impressive at your scale. But over that same period, a lot of competitors, wirehouses, independent brokers, have grown faster, actually doubled the organic growth. Just curious how you actually think about competitive landscape relative to peers. Is Schwab losing market share on a relative basis? Is some of your historic competitive advantages, are they beginning to diminish? Just curious to think about it relative to those peers that have grown much faster of accelerated growth through the last decade.\nWalter Bettinger : So I would take exception to the concept that someone else is growing faster. Are you measuring percent? Are you measuring real dollars? I just -- I don't look at anyone who's generating the type of growth that we're generating in real dollars in the -- in our industry. So I'm not quite sure I buy into that notion. I guess if somebody has a $1 and they add $1, it looks like 100% growth. If someone has $1,000 and they add $250, it's only 25%, but I'd sure rather be the second person. So I'm not sure I buy into that. And when I look at the TOA ratios, it's just -- again, the theory behind that doesn't hold any water because we know where we are on a TOA basis against all the firms that we compete with. And those numbers range from probably a worst-case scenario of around 1. So it's just a swapping. The best-case scenario is that can be measured into double digits. And some of the firms that talk about growth rates, particularly measured in percent, are some of the firms that we're taking assets at a double-digit to 1 type TOA ratio. So we -- when it comes to competition, I just want to emphasize, we respect everyone. We are paranoid, and we spend a lot of time studying competition and their moves and their opportunities and advantages they might have in their model relative advantages we might have. But when it comes to organic growth, we don't think anyone within our two primary areas, retail investor and RIA, is growing at rates comparable to us. That's just our take on it, Christian.\nUnidentified Analyst: Could you talk about the role of alternatives in clients' portfolios and what you guys are doing on that front?\nRichard Wurster : I'm going to take that. Yes, so alternatives is an area that we have capabilities in today, and clients are utilizing those capabilities, particularly on the advisory advisor side, and Bernie can talk about that more later. On the retail side, it's an area where we are seeing increased interest, and it's an area where we're building out our capabilities as we've talked about in the past. And that will take some time. And the reason it will take some time is that it's a legally complex area to be able to offer alternatives to clients in a way that's safe and sound for them and brings our fiduciary responsibility to bear on the client. So I would say, we're in the middle of building out our alternatives capability. And in the next couple of years, retail clients can expect to have that capability. And I would put it as part of our -- what we're trying to deliver to higher net worth -- ultra-high-net-worth clients that we have been building out our product-specific capabilities for them. We've done it on the liquidity side. We've done it on the lending side, and we're going to do it on the alternative side. But it will take some time because it is a complex area. We want to make sure we do it right in a way that works for the clients.\nJeff Edwards : Last question here from the web. In terms of -- as you think about growth, how do things like additional inorganic or M&A and/or international play into the future of the firm over time? And this is a question from Bill Katz at Credit Suisse.\nWalter Bettinger : Sure. Thanks, Bill, for asking the question out there in cyber land. But -- so we look at a lot of opportunities. As you can imagine, we receive a lot of inquiries with interest in -- from firms that are looking to sell or divest parts of their business. We look at everything. We look at it all carefully and closely. Our view there hasn't changed from my response to that question in years past. It's got to make sense for clients. That's the first step, the first hurdle that it has to address. Is this going to put us in a better position to serve client? If it does, then we'll go into the next steps and look at whether it makes economic sense for our stockholders, what the ROI is, what the risk is associated with doing that transaction, risk to our brand but also risk to our ability to deliver the results. Because when we undertake an acquisition, we're very committed to recognizing that it is your money or your clients' money that we're putting into that deal. So that we just have a very thorough evaluation on any kind of acquisition. International is a meaningful opportunity for us. I think Jonathan will be in a good position to share some of our thoughts there. Our dollar-based international business is growing quite rapidly. And so there is some meaningful opportunity there. To date, we have not been aggressive around multicurrency. But the dollar-only part of that business has significant opportunity that Jonathan can share in his segment.\nWalter Bettinger : I think we're at the end of our Q&A time. So again, I just want to thank all of you for being here today in person, thank all of you who are participating remotely. It is wonderful to be together. I can't wait to do it again. I'm very confident it won't be three years. And Rick, thank you for giving me the chance to share the stage with Q&A. I'll step off, and I think you'll introduce Joe.\nRichard Wurster : Yes. Joe, well, come up. Joe is going to talk about the Ameritrade integration and scale. So it should be good discussion and timely.\nJoseph Martinetto : Thanks, Rick. Good morning, everybody. So I was flipping through my e-mails this morning, and I saw one with the intriguing title of hot topics in accounting this week. And I've grown inwardly and I pushed the delete button. And I reflected for a minute that this presentation may sound a little bit like that e-mail to many of you, Joe is going to go talk about technology infrastructure. So I really want to reframe it a little bit. My two objectives today, one is to maybe get you a little bit excited about the opportunities in front of us to continue to drive scale and efficiency into the business for the long run while continuing to deliver great client experiences. So I think that's maybe a little bit more exciting. The second part is to give you an update on where we stand on the integration. And so if you still feel a need to grow and I'd ask please wait until after the prepared remarks, and then we'll take people's temperature then. So let's jump in on where we are on the integration. So we are into year 3 of work on integrating the firms at this point. And we've been doing a substantial body of work in the background to prepare for the client conversion, which is upcoming. We have done tremendous amount of work scaling the infrastructure on the Schwab Blue platform to allow us to bring over all of the accounts and positions and clients onto that platform. We've also been doing a bunch of testing of all the work that we've done. Walt made reference to the quality of the outcome that we're starting to get out of the testing at this point. We've got very high success rates, which gives us a lot of confidence that when we actually start to migrate the clients that we're going to be able to do this as effectively as possible. We have been doing work on the client side on a couple of different dimensions. So a piece of it is we've been bringing over different products and services onto the Schwab platform. So those of you that are Schwab clients may have noticed changes in the trading platform over the course of the last several months as we've been bringing on some of the best-of-breed capabilities that were on that Ameritrade platform that weren't on the Schwab platform. So when we do bring the clients over, they're going to get an experience that's pretty similar to what they had prior to the conversion. We've also been doing work to ensure that when the clients come over that they have a great experience in the process of that transition, and we'll spend a little bit more time talking about what that's going to look like on subsequent slides. But the goal here is to try to make it as easy as possible for those clients to get themselves set up on the Schwab platform so that we can, to the extent possible, pull some of those questions forward before conversion and get them addressed before the clients come over, so that when they actually are converted that they don't then find themselves in sort of a cold experience, forced to call in, and experience probably some challenging service experiences as we see a spike in activity on some of those most critical conversion dates. Rick made reference to the fact that we've been doing some work to start to make some of the products and services available to the client set. I think we're incredibly excited about the opportunity in front of us to continue to do more of that. Frankly, some of what we've done has been basically meeting demand, but we've done it in a way that probably is far more manual than what we're going to be able to deliver once we get the clients on to the Schwab Blue platform. And the last thing, Walt made reference to the fact that despite all of our best efforts, we know that there are going to be some glitches that are going to happen in the process of moving the clients over. So we've invested significantly in building out enhanced client experience or enhanced service experiences and training our people to be able to meet the needs of those clients as they do come over and also bringing on some third-party services to help us make sure that we've got some ramped up capabilities that we'll be able to meet some of the most basic client service requests and doing it in a way that's cost efficient for the long run so that these are essentially kind of meeting spike needs in terms of call volumes but not embedding them into the long-term cost structure of the company. So we are on the verge of actually starting to move clients over. The first tranche is scheduled to come over on President's Day weekend in February, a couple of weeks from now. So what we have done here is broken the clients up into 5 different transition groups. So if I use the phrase like TG 1, TG 2, excuse me, it's just kind of embedded in the way I'm thinking about it at this point. We have, in total, somewhere between 18 million and 20 million accounts that we're going to be moving over, over the course of this entire integration. And the number moves around a little bit because clients are still opening new accounts. We're still doing work to clean up accounts on the platform. So -- but still between 18 million, 20 million, give you a sense of the scale of what we are achieving here. We have a relatively small group that we're moving in February. It's about 0.5 million accounts. It's intended to be more of a test group. So it's a relatively smaller group of people who are maybe not quite the most active users of the platforms, but it's an opportunity for us to move the assets, bring them onto the platform, test the service experience, make sure all the technology is working the way we expect before we engage in some of the larger transition groups later in the year. We have a big group scheduled for the Memorial Day weekend, which is predominantly the non-advised retail client group. We've got another group scheduled for Labor Day, which is the advised client group plus the advisors. And then we have another tranche scheduled for November, which is the bulk of the traders coming over the tossed users. We have one more group of traders, those most active people that use things like futures and ForEx, that we have moved into a small tranche in the first half of 2024, and that will be the last group of clients that we'll move. We've -- I guess, it's been a while since we actually spoke in person. The war in Ukraine impacted some of the resources that we're working on some of the conversion as a result of having brought some of that. And with the TD Ameritrade acquisition, that group is no longer available to us. And as a result, we've had to do some quick shuffling to identify resources and replan some of the transition. But we're still on track to have the vast majority of clients moved over by the end of this year with a small group into next year. Because of the way we've scheduled it in that small group, we don't believe that it's going to have an impact on our ability to recognize synergies from a timing or a total dollar perspective, and I'll summarize that here in the next page as well. But we do believe that we're ready. We have done everything necessary to -- on the testing side to make sure that we are as prepared as possible. We have started client notifications and have now sent out over 10 million communications with a lot more to come this year. As people move into their time schedule, as we get closer to their transition group, they'll get a series of communications that will prepare them for what's coming and what it is we need them to do. We have built out capabilities like a Welcome Center to let people come in and get a sense of what's available on the Schwab platform. We've also built a client conversion hub. So the purpose of the client conversion hub is to get the clients to engage with Schwab and come in and set up their credentials in advance of that transition. So we get them to come in, establish their user name and their passwords. So that's all set up before they actually get to the conversion window so that we don't have a bunch of people calling in on day one saying, how do I access my account. The upside for them for doing that is they will get what we call a future view. So they will get a chance to then look at the entirety of their household as we have mapped it inside of Schwab. The TD Ameritrade platform was a very account-based platform. So it was one log-in per account. At Schwab, we're more of a household base. So we will pull all of your accounts together into a household view. Once the clients establish that credential, they get a chance to come in, see what that household view looks like. And to the extent that they have other accounts that they want to identify and get linked to their household, they'll have an opportunity to do that as well prior to conversion. So we've done a lot of good work to try to take as much friction out of this as soon as possible to ease that transition process for the clients. On the dollar side, we're still on track to achieve the expense synergies that we have communicated, and we have gotten about 2/3 of those costs out of the system already. We have plans in place to be able to recognize the remainder of those by basically end of 2024. The savings that we'll see this year will probably be relatively modest. There's a small amount, I guess, a full year impact of some savings that we got last year. There's some smaller impacts as we bring the clients over on to the Schwab platforms. There are some places where we're more efficient on the operating side. So we'll start to see that as we migrate clients over the course of this year. But the bulk of the remaining savings are really going to come from decommissioning the duplicated platforms, and that can't happen until we get all the clients over, and there's a body of work to happen in 2024 to achieve that. But that's all programmed into our plans now for the remainder of this year and into next year. On the revenue side, we feel equally as good about the long-term projections. I'd say from a macro perspective, we have actually benefited from account acquisition and asset acquisition that's been better than anything that we had in the original business case for the transaction. Here in the near term, we may have been feeling a little bit more pressure around interest rates and what it's doing to some of the balances is the biggest driver of the revenue synergies over the long run is tied to the BDA transition. But when we look at it over a long period of time, and we have a number of years to run still on that BDA, we still feel good about where we are in terms of being able to recognize the totality of the revenue synergies that we talked about. And I would highlight that while we have started to do some basic work around things like offering banking products and services and we've done a few other things to make things like managed investing available, but it's still a pretty clunky process. Even with that clunky process, we've had really good feedback from the clients. I think Rick dimensionalized some of the opportunities that we think might be out there for us. Some of those numbers were not included in these revenue synergy numbers. So if anything, I would say that we probably have some upside out there related to some of those opportunities that we haven't put into the synergies. Switching over to some of the -- rest of the technology stack. We haven't been sitting on our hands while we've been working on integration. We have been continuing to do a lot of work in the background on some of the things that we have talked about over a number of years. We have had to restructure some of this work as a result of doing the integration. And while -- you can see that there's really 3 or 4 things here that we've talked about historically as being sort of independent programs. This has almost become a singular body of work that was necessary to accomplish to be able to affect the transition of all the clients and to build the scale that was necessary to deliver that. You can see on application modernization, which is really the move to pull a lot of the capabilities off of that old monolithic mainframe system and put it on to a distributed environment where we could scale it more efficiently. We're about 3/4 of the way through that body of work with the remainder of it expected to deliver over the course of the first half of this year. So that program is wrapping up basically on time and pretty close to on spend levels in terms of what we expected. We continue to see real benefits there in terms of some of the choices we've made. Really what we've done with the new environment that we've built is created a set of technology that's capable of being cloud-hosted. And we've, in essence, put it on a private cloud inside of our own data centers. So I'd say we have been a little bit interrupted in terms of some of our thinking around cloud migration. Because of the integration, we've been more focused on making sure that the platform is scaled and ready to accept the additional volumes. But there's still an opportunity out there to continue to migrate additional capabilities to the cloud. Even with that, we've identified a number of workloads that we have already been in process of moving, and I'd say they really fall into two main categories. So one of them is things like account log-in where you get big spikes in activity at points in time over the day, where it's pretty inefficient for us to build enough technology to deal with that volume that comes in over 3 minutes at market open, and you got to carry that capacity for the remainder of the day. Those kinds of workloads scale really efficiently in the cloud. And so we're prioritizing work like that as we think about some of our first moves to the cloud. I'd say the other part is things where capabilities are developing in the cloud that are becoming increasingly difficult to acquire and run on-premise. A lot of the analytical tools and the data tools that are now available at a lot of the cloud providers are really just superior to what we're able to build and deliver in our own platform. So a lot of the work we've been doing is establishing our client information and other databases out on the cloud and data warehouses to allow us to take advantage of those kinds of analytical capabilities going forward. So work has continued to progress on the things that are maybe most important in terms of cloud impact, but there's a lot of work left that we're going to be able to continue to think about. Scale and resiliency. So that movement to a private cloud structure has allowed us to build out a much more -- it looks a lot like the way modern cloud is hosted internally. So we've gone to this own region approach. So we've got multiple regions where we're running multiple zones inside of each region. That has given us not only the capability to scale effectively, but it also has given us the capability to manage the way we adapt when we see system challenges. So one of the things that's mentioned up here is legacy retirement. One of the things that we have done for years when we have system problems, we used the code base called [host fallback] which was a completely separate mainframe-based application, which had a really limited set of capabilities on it. So when we had to go into host fallback, we were limiting what our clients could do. They could trade and see balances with things like money movement, and a lot of the more advanced asset management capabilities we've built over the years really weren't enabled in host fallback. And so today, with what we've built in terms of the way the infrastructure runs, we're going to fall over from a zone within a region and then across the regions a lot more elegantly than what we used to have to implement with host fallback. And as a result of that, the clients should notice a lot less when we have system problems and have basically access to all the capabilities when we're going through that transition process. So it allows us to retire that block of host fallback code, as an example of some of the kinds of things that are happening in the background as we continue to make progress on modernizing some of the core infrastructure. So as we look forward, we are not done with some of the opportunities. You might be surprised to see that the #1 opportunity we highlighted here is Ameritrade integration. But when you think about what we've done with integration so far, we really gave ourselves a set of constraints that were driven by how much we were going to spend to get the integration done, the time frame that we needed to execute that conversion in. Now, obviously as we\u2019re in the timeframe we're willing to get it done. And so as a result, we had to opt on the amount of synergies we were looking to achieve. When you put all those things together, we made decisions that we thought were smart decisions as we were working our way through the integration approach. But that optimization frame meant that there was a series of things that we didn't tackle that give us future opportunities to continue to drive more efficiency as we look to some of the things that are still sitting out there. Public cloud migration, number two. There's still tremendous opportunity for us to look to move more workloads into the cloud. We're running a much larger and more complicated on-premise data center structure than we would like to run for the long run. The cloud really becomes the solution for how we get some of that workload off of the on-premise structures and lets us start to rationalize some of that over time. Efficiency and automation and the operations component. So some of that is very similar to the comments I made on Ameritrade integration. We made choices as we were thinking about how we were bringing these workloads together to try to make sure that we were going to achieve the synergy targets that we had committed to. But now with the volumes that we're at as we start to bring this work together, there's a lot of workloads that we can go through and continue to bring additional automation to. It's just a matter of now taking the resources that have been working on integration and starting to migrate them toward working on that further automation. And then finally, broker-dealer modernization. So those of you that have followed along for enough years might remember that broker-dealer modernization was actually a component originally of what we were trying to do with application modernization. And we pulled it out of that body of work as we migrated more towards some of the integration efforts. So the core here is to take that old core mainframe application books and record system of the broker-dealer and migrate it to a modern -- a more modern platform solution, probably a SaaS-based solution, as we look out into the marketplace and see what's available today. That not only drives additional expense benefits, but it also gives us an opportunity to take advantage of some capabilities that we don't have inside of the Schwab platform today. So things like multicurrency capabilities or multi-firm capabilities that we just don't have, given us an opportunity to think about where we might go with products and services in a way that it's not a to us on the platform that we have today. So it's a cost save, but it's also an opportunity for us to continue to build additional products and services to deliver to our clients. So there's a great body of work here that we're starting to try to figure out exactly how we're going to tackle it and sequence it, but we see a number of years of continued efficiency here that we're going to be able to deliver long beyond just the core integration work. So with that, I see hands coming up. We're opening the Q&A. Let's go ahead and get started.\nSteven Chubak : Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research. It's a great presentation, Joe. You noted that you've been very acquisitive that certainly impacted the timing of the cloud migration. I know a few years ago, you talked about as you execute on that plan, modernizing technology, migrating fully to a public cloud that you'd be able to bend the cost curve, maybe slow the rate of expense growth somewhere in the range of 2% to 4%. Is that still the long-term ambition as you execute on this plan?\nJoseph Martinetto : Sure. So I think we got to be a little careful here. So cloud doesn't come for free. There is investment that has to be made to be able to do the migration to the cloud. And we are not talking about moving everything that we do in terms of technology workloads on to the cloud. So that is not the goal. We are looking to take the things that make the most sense to run on the cloud and move them there. But we expect that we're going to be running on-site data centers for the foreseeable future. There's a certain amount of workload that's going to make sense for us to continue to manage on our own. So it's definitely an opportunity to use to continue to bend that cost curve. I think some of the bigger savings will actually come more on the physical side of data centers and data center infrastructure. Because of what we've done with the integration, we're running quite a number of data centers now, including some are owned and some are leased. But we've had to take on additional space just to be able to house all the hardware, get enough power and enough cooling to run everything that we see coming out of post-integration. And so rationalizing some of that workload will allow us to rationalize some of that footprint and continue to bend that cost curve. What I think probably important to think about is, like I talked about some of the integration work as being a single body of work. I think some of this optimization work is also going to be taken in the same kind of frame. On any given system, it may feel like a step-function change. But for a company as big as ours and given everything we spend in technology, it's probably not going to feel like a step-function reduction, it's going to feel more like a portfolio of work that's going to allow us to continue to drive some incremental scale consistently over time. So I think bending the cost curve is probably the right way to think about it. It will allow us to slow that pace of growth as we absorb new volumes and continue to drive efficiency into the processing that we're doing. Peter is going to have more to say about what the long-term prospects are for expenses as we look out a number of years. And so I think it's all kind of baked into his numbers. And so I'll defer the more specific answer to his presentation, if that's okay.\nUnidentified Analyst: Joe, you're sort of the special team's guy here now. But I guess the first question is on the attrition, so -- or potential attrition, maybe it's zero. But what do you feel -- like the scorecard here for the integration, what do you feel is sort of the bar? And how will it be measured? Like will we see the account numbers? Will that be real time and -- or monthly as well? So that's the first part of it. And then the second part, in past integrations, it was just moving accounts to a platform. Now this is more sophisticated. And from what I understand, you're trying to do a lot more as you move the wealthier clients, like the documentation of power attorneys and so forth. So I guess the question is, how do you accomplish -- you didn't really talk about that. So how complicated is the migrations? And when are those coming, where you really got to do more than just moving DLJ direct onto accounts or..\nJoseph Martinetto : Yes. So starting with attrition. The business case embedded a pretty modest 2% kind of number. So we are not expecting a material amount of attrition. We're going to measure it as best we can through the process. The risk probably comes at the time of conversion that as those clients get those notifications, that is probably the point where if we're going to see attrition, it's probably going to be as we're moving those specific books of business. We're doing everything possible to make sure that we're communicating with those clients, following up with those clients, giving them a great experience, trying to make it easy. Right now, I would say we are way ahead of the game in terms of client acquisition versus any attrition numbers that we embedded in the model, but we are probably going into the window where if we're going to see attrition present. As they are business folks, maybe you want to ask them is if they get up on stage to talk about what they're doing and how they're seeing it. But for right now, I think we're feeling pretty good about the attrition number based on the feedback we've been getting. From the process side, I'd say this is maybe a little bit different of an acquisition than something, I'll drop here, a little more like the USAA, where -- that was we bought a book of business. It happened over a weekend. We couldn't do anything with those clients prior. We converted their accounts, their assets. We opened for business. We had them set up their credentials on day one. That was a rockier kind of experience because of the nature of that transaction and the limitations on our ability to work with those clients in advance. Here, we own both broker-dealers. So we can essentially subsume those accounts. We already have the clients. We have the client account agreements in place. We can transfer those across the organization without having to novate new paper, right? They're not going to be new account forms. There's not going to be new sign-ups. There's not going to be -- it's not paper-based, right? We essentially have taken care of all of that in the process of reviewing the account agreements already. We've been doing a number of things in the background to try to pull work forward to make this easier on us and easier on the clients. We have actually gone through a process now where we have created every TD Ameritrade account and formed all of the households. So we are now running all of that infrastructure on the Schwab Blue platform. So all of that is set up and ready to go. The accounts are ready to receive the assets over the course of the transition weekend. And the clients, as I said earlier, are going to get that notification window and the opportunity to start to interact with that process much earlier and, we hope, much more seamlessly. We do know that there would be some clients that won't do that in advance and will, therefore, need to either go through that process after conversion or will call us and say, \"Gee, I tried to log on and I can't get on. What do I have to do?\" And we'll have to help them get their credentials established. And we have, as we said, trained 11,000 Schwab employees. We have brought on a substantial block of third-party resources to help us deal with that. We have done everything that we can foresee. Again, I can't say it's going to be completely seamless, but it should be as well engineered as we can possibly make it. We have cleaned up over 3 million client records just trying to make sure that when people come across, their accounts won't be restricted because we'll have to put a know-your-client block on it because we don't have all the information. We've gone through, we've contacted the clients, we've got the information, we've cleaned that stuff up. We are down to really small numbers, measured in like thousands of accounts that we think right now we still might have some kind of lock on. But when you think about 18 million to 20 million accounts moving and maybe something less than 10,000 accounts to where we're still working to refine client data, and we still have the majority of the year to work on some of that. Like I said, we have done everything possible to try to make sure this goes as smoothly as it possibly can.\nUnidentified Analyst: Firstly, thank you for this presentation. None of your peers gives us any sort of insight into their infrastructure strategy. So this is very helpful. On modernization, my question is around how you think about capitalizing on artificial intelligence. Given your tech stack is still a little bit on-prem, there's still some mainframe infrastructure, can you capitalize on AI? And to the extent you can, sort of what areas, whether it's client-facing or back end, can AI help?\nJoseph Martinetto : Yes. So I mean you saw one of the primary cloud initiatives was to move our databases over onto cloud database. Some of that was to be able to take advantage of some of the advanced analytic capabilities that are available in those environments that are hard to stand up independently. So I think we've been doing the work to prepare ourselves to take advantage of those more advanced analytics. I'm a fan of AI, but I don't know that it's necessarily necessary. There's a lot of other advanced analytics that you can drive before you even get to AI that will let you be able to deliver superior client experiences. We've got some instances where we're already doing some of that work. We've got capabilities that we've built over the years like Next Best Conversation, so our service professionals based on the cues that they're seeing, get a series of prompts that are delivered to them to try to make sure that they're navigating through the right things that the clients might have an interest in. We have things like the Schwab intelligent assistance, an online chat bot that's being driven by a lot of those same kind of capabilities. So we've been building up some of those core capabilities. I think we'll be able to accelerate into some of that where we see the opportunity. Some of it may be AI, some of it may be more just kind of boring advanced analytics that we all kind of know how to deploy. But really, the primary unlock here is to get that database established in the cloud where we can start to use some of those more advanced analytics.\nUnidentified Analyst: Quick one. As you're getting ready now to do this integration, have any potential dis-synergies emerged, whereas like maybe difference in margin rates or whatnot, when you move that conversion over? And how should we be thinking about that?\nJoseph Martinetto : I'd say nothing beyond what we had already anticipated as part of the transaction. So we have been working to -- so margin rates were different. We have been working to kind of normalize the margin rates as we've gone through this process of rate increases. So that gap has decreased somewhat, but there's still a little bit that's going to have to get recognized as the clients move over because the Blue schedule is below the Green schedule. Some of that's intentional so that when clients come over, they will see that they get a price improvement. So we've done some of this to be able to deliver an enhanced experience to the client at the time that they've moved. But we've, in some respects, tried to minimize the impact that's going to flow through financially. Although some of that is still going to get recognized over the course of 2023 as we bring the clients in, it was anticipated, but this is the year it hits.\nJoseph Martinetto : So I think we're out of time here. It's my job to let you know that we're going on a break. We've got 15 minutes. So let's take the break and come on back for the rest of the day. Thank you all. Good to see everybody. [Break]\nUnidentified Company Representative: Let's pick up where we left off. Please welcome Jonathan Craig -- all right.\nJonathan Craig : Welcome back, everyone. So what I'd like to do over the next 20 minutes is give a quick update on the retail business and, in particular, share some of the 2022 retail accomplishments and then spend the bulk of the time on priorities for 2023 in retail. It's fair to say when you think about priorities for retail in 2023 and beyond, the most significant of which, of course, is to complete the biggest integration in our history and industry history. But at the same time, I want to talk about some other priorities because it is those priorities and those investments that will set us up for the next decade of growth coming out of this integration. Let me just level set with some numbers on that we take out and, of course, the acquisition of Ameritrade has become a business of significant size and scale. We are sitting at $3.2 trillion in retail client assets, almost 25 million brokerage accounts and this year, $176 billion in net new assets. And despite all that growth, we've stuck to a very focused business model. Every single employee in retail, which is to help individual investors and traders achieve great financial outcomes, either directly or through an intermediary. And we do that, of course, by bringing a broad set of capabilities to the table from advice and trading to asset management, financial planning, banking and more. And then we complement those broad capabilities with distinct sets of capabilities for the unique needs of key client segments -- in this business, in 2022, we delivered strong results. I mentioned $176 billion in net new assets, 1.2 million new retail house average trades. And of course, those in-year results are strong, but I think what's more demonstrative of the resilience of the franchise is some of the multiyear trends. Walt shared some earlier as to direct, but just another example, our 3-year compound annual growth rates are 28%, 7% and 55%, respectively, for those core net new assets. Beyond the results, we continue to receive strong industry recognition from folks like Investors Business Daily, J.D. Power, Investopedia and others. And as much as we covet that third-party recognition, what we most aspire 2 or 4 is recognition from clients because they experienced Schwab every day and really pleased to see in retail a Client Promoter Score 65 in 2022. Any market would be strong, but they were, I think, particularly strong in the environment in which they were delivered in an environment that you all know, but an environment where all asset classes, I think, other than cash and commodities were down where investor sentiment hit decade loans. In that environment, it was more important than ever that we be there for our clients. These are critical times to really demonstrate your client centricity when the markets behave like they did in 2022. Being there for your clients means lots of different things, but among other things, it means maybe most importantly, picking up the phone when they call -- across the retail for all clients. This includes our core clients. We picked up the phone with an average of 24 seconds. I think that's an impressive number, I think, industry-leading. And certainly, if you've interacted with other firms outside they agree that, that is demonstrative of being there for our clients in a difficult time. Being there for our clients also means having reliable web and app experiences, which we did throughout the year. It means delivering -- we did that through our thousands of financial consultants through hundreds of thousands of financial plans that were delivered. And then finally, being there for our clients meant delivering insights, ideas and perspectives, both in-the-moment as well as throughout the year. And we do that in multiple channels via the web, via apps, newsletters, client e-mail, of course, social media, podcasts and even our live TD Ameritrade Network. Now it\u2019s one thing to produce content, what\u2019s more meaningful is whether clients engage with the content and we had record engagement across the board. So really pleased to see how the team stepped up to really be there for our clients. And I think, again, that was probably one of the stronger indications of why our client service level -- our client promotor scores were as high as they were. In addition to delivering strong results and being there, we also -- for our clients, we also made meaningful enhancements to our retail offer in 2022. We relaunched Schwab Wealth Advisory, which formerly was called Schwab Private Client. This is our marquee wealth management solution for retail clients. You're going to hear more about this from Nisha later. We continued our emphasis on personalized investing, I think Rick talked about by launching things like Schwab Personize indexing, Schwab thematic stocklist and we'll continue to do more in both of those areas. -- continue to invest in client service. We added 2,400 new service folks last year as well as invested in a service ecosystem, not the least of which we moved all of our voice telephony platform to more modern, nimble, cloud-based solution. to emphasize and invest in our digital experience we also enhanced our trading capabilities, launching an all-in-one trade ticket as well as making enhancements to thinker swim trading. And then finally, we continue to invest in our relationship models, critically important part of the Schwab retail value proposition. I'll talk more about this, but we assign tens of thousands of more clients to a dedicated relationship, and we continue to integrate, modernize and expand our physical branch network. Last thing I'll say about '22 as you can imagine, we spent a lot of time preparing for this big integration. This big event that's going to happen this year. I could point to a lot of things, but just a couple I'll highlight. Notably, we completed the dual registration of all of our green -- so when I say green, I mean Ameritrade, sorry, Blue Schwab, you didn't catch that. We completed the dual registration of [ALCO] -- and what that means is they're registered with the TDA broker-dealer, but also with the Schwab broker dealer, but as well as with Schwab Bank. And what that means is that they can talk to their clients about they can enroll those clients in those solutions if they make sense and they can get paid on their solutions. You can see on the lower left, that's been already a significant unlock of value. And of course, we're very -- we're just at the beginning. Once they are fully immersed in the Schwab model, I expect a significant opportunity there. We also prepared our service teams and our clients for the conversion. On the service side, we've fully harmonized our service teams. We've harmonized licensing, compensation, training, everything. So it is one service team across Ameritrade and Schwab. And then on the client side, we did everything to harmonize pricing, policies, experiences so that when the Ameritrade client converts from green to blue, the change is minimized. And then finally, critically important synergies. Obviously, a big part of the value creation in this deal is synergies, and we're on track to deliver our synergies, as Joe mentioned. And just one example in my world over $200 million already across both firms without losing any market momentum. So if that's '22, let me talk about 23, really twofold: number one, and again, probably most critically, successfully execute the biggest integration in our history and in industry history. But it goes beyond that. We are also going to make other investments in our corporate priorities of segmentation, monetization and scale. Starting with the integration, Joe mentioned some of this, but the retail part of the integration will happen over 5 -- all 5 transition weekends starting in a couple of weeks in February and then May, September, November and then a very small transition group in early 2024. We are doing everything possible to create a seamless positive client experience for these clients when they go through this significant change. Among other things, we've developed a robust set of client communications and digital experiences so that clients know exactly what to expect, what's coming and what they have to do, which, by the way, is just set up new credentials. It really will be a simple lot to optimize the front line so that the front line is ready for the client calls that are going to come in. We've trained and developed a whole set of transition specialists. We've made significant enhancements to our service desktop, launch new service tools, extensive training that is going on and will continue to go on throughout the year. And then on the client side, we are doing everything we can to close any remaining gaps may not have been able to do it on blue. A perfect example on the blue side and the Schwab side, we will be launching streaming quotes streaming on both web and app. Currently, that's only available on green, on Ameritrade, we're going to bring it to Schwab before the conversion, so that -- so the clients notice that. Another example is we're making final enhancements to money movement. So any money move capabilities that were available on Ameritrade will be similarly available on Schwab when the conversion happens. Lastly, I want to say about the conversion and Joe mentioned this, but this is a novel conversion in that we're not just bringing over the clients' accounts and assets client relationship. That's why it's taken a lot of time. We're bringing over their open orders, their move money instructions, their beneficiaries, their history, their cost basis. The entire relationship is coming over. And I think that's pretty novel to anything we've seen in the industry. And I think that's a big part of why we think it's going to be a seamless experience other than the fact that they'll have a new website and a new app. No matter how well we do, we expect client calls without question, when you drive client change, you get client calls. And we are investing a lot on after the conversion weekends and then for several weeks thereafter. We're pulling multiple levers. Number one, we are doing significant incremental hiring that is onetime expense, onetime hiring, but it's bringing forward hiring so that we have those folks there to take calls. We're leveraging all management levers that we have, things like enhancing over time, ensuring that we're not doing off-phone activities or training on those critical times, holiday blackouts, all the stuff you'd expect. We're leveraging technology even to a greater degree, so things like intelligent assistance, virtual callback, scheduled callback. Now we're leveraging our partners across the firm, the most significant of which is we have thousands of branch personnel on the Schwab side who are licensed. Those Schwab branch personnel are going to be taking phone calls for us during those critical -- after those critical transition weekends. And then finally, we are leveraging some outsourced support from some third parties to help us with some of those low risk, low complexity calls we know we're going to get. So I know we are doing -- I'm confident we're doing everything we can to make the experience seamless to ensure we have the service capacity and to do this conversion with -- in a way that is consistent with our through client size strategy. Beyond integration, the other priority is scale and efficiency. Probably the #1 way to drive scale and efficiency for Schwab from where I'm sitting is to continue to drive outsized organic growth. We are going to do that, which is data-driven marketing, a unique sales and relationship model, the importance of our workplace business and critically important referral. Stacey is going to come up and talk more about each of those. Scale efficiency, though, is also about being easier to do business with. For us, that's about continuing to invest in our multiyear priorities of digitizing more and more and really continuing to transform how we serve clients and how we do relationship management in a way that emphasizes ease. Critically important, when we talk about efficiency at Schwab, it's not about how do we reduce cost to get clients to self-serve. It's how do we deliver clients easier, better experiences. Now when we do that, what often happens is the cost to serve is down. So it is a win-win, but the motivation, the focus -- it may seem like a nuance, but the focus is always about how do we make it easier for our clients to interact with us. Second priority is around what we call win-win or client-centric monetization. Really, this is all about taking the capital that we have with our clients and leveraging that to do more for them, which all with the goal of helping them get better financial outcomes. And what that often leads to is wealth management or bank lending. On the wealth management side, you're going to hear a whole presentation from Nisha on the tremendous opportunity there. But suffice to say, we have a lot of growth opportunity there. On an asset basis across both Schwab and Ameritrade, right about 15% asset penetration deliver wealth management to clients, the TOA ratios go up, the Client Promoter Scores go up, attrition goes down and ultimately, our economics go up. So it really is the definition of a win-win. A lot of our focus there, again, will be on Schwab Wealth Advisory as well as continued efforts in the direct indexing space and other personalized investing opportunities. Bank lending is also a significant opportunity. We've seen a lot of growth, but we have a lot of opportunities, as Rick shared. Much of the focus as it relates to retail there is to continue to enhance our bank lending capabilities, particularly for high net worth and ultra high net worth. We see more and more demand there, and I think we see more and more opportunity to deliver more specialized treatment for those clients. The second priority on bank is around pledged PAL, pledged asset lines, highly sought after credit facility for our retail clients. We see great opportunity there to digitize more and more to reduce cycle times, but also to extend relationship pricing to the PAL offer, which is a core part of how we want to go to market for our clients. Last priority is about segmentation and segmentation starts with a Schwab delivering differentiated relationship models to our clients. We will continue to deliver those models very simply because they work. In fact, when you compare a client who has a relationship, a financial consultant with the client controlling for all other factors that we can control for, you see 2.5x greater NNA, 2.8x improvement in TOA and a 2x improvement in attrition. So in a way that reflects the different needs of our clients, but also the different economics that they deliver to Schwab. We have four primary models to support that. The mass affluent model is a scaled model generally for the sub-$1 million. We have the traditional FC, the local FC of the folks you see largely in branches serve largely the 1 million-plus client at Schwab. For the $10 million plus, we've built an ultra-high net worth specialized model. This is a high-touch model built particularly for ultra net worth -- and then we have specialized financial consultants for active traders, which have always been critically important, but even more important when you think about the integration of the Ameritrade client base. Segmentation relationships are important, but segmentation goes beyond relationships. And we segment across all aspects of the business at Schwab. But historically, that segmentation has been largely behind the scenes by design. That's been a little bit inconsistent and that we might segment in one part of the business, a little bit different than another. We might have different breakpoints. Going forward, we are going to change that. We are going to launch 1 million plus and a $10 million-plus set of branded segments, branded client experiences. These clients already represent more than 2/3 of our client assets, and they also represent the areas where we have the greatest growth -- we want to deliver to ensure we're meeting their unique needs, we want to deliver meaningful segmentation across relationship service or in a entertainment per with the $10 million plus the relationship model will be one of our top financial consultants or a wealth consultant that I referenced earlier. The service model will be served by our most capable, most tenured premier service teams. On the operations side, we've built a bespoke operations model for ultra-high net worth and then, of course, product access, pricing benefits, fee waivers, special client events. There will be a host of other benefits for that client segment. And for the $1 million to $10 million, we will differentiate along those similar dimensions. The one addition is the $10 million private wealth services. We'll be rolling these branded segments out later this year in advance of the green clients who qualify for these segments, converting the Ameritrade clients converting over to Schwab. So that when the Ameritrade clients become Schwab clients, day 1, they will be in Schwab Private Client Services and/or private wealth services depending on their assets. And it's certainly not least critically important is the importance of the trader segment. Trader has always been important to Schwab, but it's gotten even more important with the integration of Ameritrade to eternal last year, almost 40% given the volatility. Our focus on trader is really to solidify this position continue to grow. We believe we're in a really strong position. Once we get thinkers Schwab platform, which will be middle of this year, we'll have the full trading ecosystem at Schwab, defined by powerful downloadable web and app platforms defined by industry-leading specialized service teams, a comprehensive product suite and engaging and thoughtful, I think, industry-leading education as well. I think that's some total -- certainly from where I sit, we are planning to relaunch our trader offer later this year, pretty publicly allowed me in the marketplace. So before I -- before I bring Stacy up, I hope you have a sense of the investments we're making to ensure that this integration goes seamlessly and well and that will happen. And also the investments we're making to set us up for the next decade of growth around segmentation, monetization and scale. I thought I'd just end by where do I think this will position us sort of this time next year, value proposition for self-directed investors, active traders and those seeking advice with premium offers for high net worth and ultra high net worth, all supported by a no trade-offs value proposition, including the industry-only satisfaction guarantee. So a very strong value proposition back by over -- backed by a broader Schwab wide winning approach, an approach that emphasizes client centricity, everything we do is seen through clients' eyes, an approach that emphasizes a singularity of focus, everybody coming to work with one objective, help individual investors achieve great outcomes. A long-term view or willingness to take disruptive moves when it makes sense for the client. And finally, an expense discipline, a commitment to expense discipline, which allows us to continue to bring costs down for investors and feed that virtuous cycle. So a strong value proposition backed by a winning approach. The last thing I'll say, still significant opportunity. We are operating in the retail business in a business that's growing double digits with single-digit, 5% market share. So externally, tremendous opportunity to grow even more opportunity. When you look at our share of wallet, I think Rick shared these numbers as well, tremendous opportunity to grow share of wallet on the Schwab side, even more on the Ameritrade side. When you look at asset advice penetration, banking penetration, utilization of our advanced trading tools, in all those cases, we are in the single digits or low double digits. So a lot of opportunity internally as well. And finally, we have a diversified client and asset acquisition model to go after all that but I hope you have a sense of sort of where my passion comes from where I'm sitting with the strength of where we are today, the strength of where we'll be a year from now and the tremendous opportunity that sits in front of us over the next decade. So let me bring up Stacy to talk about how we're going to go after it all...\nStacy Hammond : Thanks, Jonathan. As you've heard many times already today, the external environment has created some headwinds. And as expected, our new client outcomes have moderated as a result and yet we continue to perform at pre-pandemic levels. So in 2022, we acquired 1.2 million new clients. Those are clients who entrusted us with their money to help them grow and manage their wealth. And it was the third highest year in terms of new clients that both Ameritrade and Schwab have ever seen. In addition to continuing to acquire a large number of new clients who entrust us with their money, the profile of the clients that we're attracting has been consistent and very attractive. So of almost 60% of the new clients that we acquire are under the age of 40. And at the same time, maybe on the other side of the coin, we're seeing a significant increase in the number of new clients who are funding to affluent, defined here as 250,000. So we saw a threefold increase in the number of clients who upon becoming new clients fund affluent. There are a couple of data points that we look at to understand the profile of the new clients that we're attracting. I'll point out a couple of them here. The first, you've heard many people already today talk about TOA ratio. When we see more new clients funding with securities than cash, it's a signal to us that we are winning business from competitors because that is already invested money. When we're winning cash, it feels like we are winning new money to market. And we're starting to see an improvement. Of course, in '20 and '21, we saw a lot more cash. Now we're starting to see more funding via TOA. We're also seeing initial funding increase, and that's probably also a function of the fact that it's already invested assets. But we've seen more than 100% increase in initial funding rates. And finally, and this shouldn't surprise any of you, as I'm sure it's similar to your behavior as a consumer. We continue to see an increase in the number of new clients who are opening via mobile or web rather than physically in a branch in person. This success is driven, as you've heard a couple of times already today by a diversified acquisition strategy that has remained consistent. Similar to an investor's diversified portfolio, each lever in our acquisition strategy serves a different purpose and balances one another. I'll share a little bit more about marketing in a minute here, but it's one of the most significant contributors to our new client outcomes, driving about 40% of our outcomes consistently over time. Whether it's a financial consultant inviting a prospect to a ballgame or whether it's one of our phone teams, picking up the call -- picking up the phone and making a welcome call. We know that people are central to our value proposition. And in fact, earlier, I referenced that we're seeing an increasing number of new clients opening accounts online. Well, if a new client opens an account in a branch, we see 6x the average funding of an account that's opened online. That is, of course, both a function of the type of person who is attracted to walking into a branch. And it is also a function of the relationship and the conversation that the financial consultant can have with the new client. Our relationships with employers introduce Schwab to their participants, which in turn creates affinity so that when those participants have needs beyond their 401(k) or their stock plan Schwab could be there to support their financial wellness. And as the workplace business grows, of course, the opportunity for retail growth. And finally, as Jonathan just referenced, core to what we do is delivering an exceptional client experience. And in turn, when we do that, our clients refer us. They talk to their friends about their experiences at Schwab. With the addition of Ameritrade's trading capabilities that you just heard a fair amount about and also their incredibly robust educational content, each lever in the acquisition strategy becomes stronger. We have more things to talk about in marketing. Our people have more ways to help. We have more things to offer our participants in workplace. And finally, we have more reasons to love us so that they will refer us to their friends. I promised I talked a little bit more about marketing, which is a significant contributor to our new client growth. And our approach is central to our success. It starts with very clear design targets, which allows us to be focused not only in our messaging, but also in our media buys. And of course, with the addition of Ameritrade's trading capabilities, we see tremendous opportunity ahead to be a lot louder in terms of our trading capabilities targeting active traders. So just like each lever in our acquisition strategy serves a purpose so does the channels through which we communicate with prospects and existing clients. And what I'd like to do is use a consumer trend that we're seeing to illustrate how those channels play together. So Jonathan referenced earlier that we're seeing increased engagement in our educational and market insight content. This isn't super surprising, given what's been happening in the market. But we've seen interest in content absolutely triple. So while we do use paid media to amplify our education and our experts voice, -- we also focus very much on the experience that you get when you come to Schwab.com. So you come to consume the education, but then it's our responsibility to ensure that you stay engaged by serving up an experience that makes it obvious as to what your next step should be. We also are expanding our owned channels. Many of you have probably increased your podcast consumption over the past several years, and we want to be where investors are. And so we now have a podcast. Jonathan referenced this earlier as well, where we've seen just incredible interest from prospects and from existing clients. And finally, of course, we use Earned media or PR, also to amplify our experts voices. Perhaps more important than how we do what we do is the -- that was what we do. Sorry, the channels is how we do it. And consistent with our challenger heritage, we're continuously disrupting ourselves to figure out how to market and how to market relative to our competitors. So I'd like to spend a minute talking a little bit about how we use measurement, creativity and innovation to set ourselves apart from the category. So Jonathan referenced our marketing synergies earlier. And with media inflation, it's more critical than ever that every dollar that we spend is as efficient as it can be and analytics is the way that we achieve that. I'll just touch on a couple of examples here of some of the analytics that we use. The first is relatively new, which is called a multi-touch attribution model, and that enables us to see how all channels, whether they are offline or online, work together to deliver outcomes. The reason why this is so important is that with cookie redaction, most advertisers lost their ability to see the prospect or client journey and seeing that journey is how we deliver efficiency. So what we've done is created a solution where we have a privacy compliant first-party tag, the reason why the cookies went away was a privacy issue. And we are building a model where we will be able to see how touch points from the branch network to schwab.com to digital advertising, work together and contribute to every new client and every dollar that new client brings to us. Our marketing mix optimization model is an econometric model that we use regularly to help us refine our media allocation across channels and also to help us anticipate outcomes. We're constantly improving the model. It has controlled variables like the number of branches that we have or what's happening in the external environment. And we add predictors of outcomes. For example, this year, we added personal savings rate, which probably is no surprise to you, tends to be a pretty good predictor of our outcomes. We also changed our media buy based on what we see from the model, and I referenced earlier, podcasts and education, where we have recently increased our media spend in audio and in what we call native, which is where we distribute our education to where investors are seeking to consume education. And like many things at Schwab, our approach to marketing is a little different than the category. We do engage in all of the [indiscernible] channels. They are workhorses for us, but we do it in a way that sets us apart from the competition. So taking advertising as an example, a lot of competitors in our category advertise the category, they advertise financial planning or the benefits of wealth management. We believe that we have to advertise in a way that is tangible and uniquely solves an unmet client need. So recently, we launched a campaign called Humans. I referenced earlier that our people are central to everything we do at Schwab. And each video in the humans campaign demonstrates our shared commitment to serving clients and brings to life a tangible point of differentiation, many of which Jonathan referenced in his presentation, whether it's our service or our satisfaction guarantee or in the case of Jim Tides, one of our financial consultants who tells the story about his father's business and how important it was to him to be clear and transparent with his clients about how much they were paying. He talks about what price transparency is important to Schwab and how that informs his approach to his practice. I'm also sure many of you recognize our friend Carl. Carl, is our antihero. He is the broker that represents what our competitors cannot do so that we can crisply articulate what we can do. And both humans and Karl consistently test in the top 5 in the industry in terms of TV advertising. Getting a little jump through there, sorry. Finally, lots of people have probably been to a golf tournament with a financial services firm. I'm sure you've stood there and watched on the fairway. This is another place where we continually innovate. Let's start with the fact that we named the tournament that we sponsored the Charles Schwab challenge in -- consistent with our heritage. We wanted to telegraph what it is that we stand for through the tournament. We also viewed the tournament with all kinds of innovations that were driven by both the players experience and the guests of the financial consultant's experience, whether it was a moment of silence because the tournament takes place over Memorial Day or the car that everybody loves to talk about, traditionally, you get a Tartan jacket and a trophy when you win a golf tournament, we kitted out a car that stands for something unique at Schwab that the winner of the tournament received and drives away with, which has been just tremendous from a media bus perspective. And finally, our competitors tend to host large events. They tend to focus it on the category. They want to talk about what they do. We do that, too, but the way in which we do it more creatively is we tap into clients' passions. So an example of this is that for Schwab investing themes, we are tapping into people's passion for beer, which seems like a rather obvious one, but we have different types of beer that tie to the different themes that enables us to then have a conversation about why you might be interested in renewable energy. This, of course, is just one example, but one that shows tremendous engagement because we're listening to the client. I mentioned earlier some of the innovations that we've done when we see consumer behavior changing or when we see the media landscape changing. I'll start with -- we do use traditional channels, but we're also looking for ways to engage with prospects in high engagement categories. You may be surprised to learn that 65%, 2/3 of adults use some gaming platform. And Jeff Kleintop, our Chief Global Investment Strategist, is one of that 65%. So he recently held a session on Twitch with the gamer, the purpose of which was not to equate investing in gaming. The purpose of which was to go to a place where investors are highly engaged and educate them about portfolio diversification, asset allocation and risk tolerance in a place where their eyes were glued to the screen. It's a great example of how we go through where consumers are. We all run advertising in traditional media. You see it when you open the Wall Street Journal or when you turn on CNBC. But again, we're looking for environments where we know that eyeballs are watching with their full attention and a really great example of this is holiday movies. So we actually inserted our brand digitally into 3 holiday movies recently on Hallmark and interestingly found that brand recall was higher from those holiday movies than some traditional advertising. Again, it's our insight that, that is a place where people are giving their undivided attention. And finally, last example here, you've all been to a restaurant with a financial services firm, while we upped our game, and we wanted to bring to life what is special about our financial consultants. So we hosted a barbecue cook-off in Atlanta and Denver. And each financial consultant had their own special sauce that brought to life what is different about them. and what the financial consultants love about this is that it enables them to connect in a very human way by something that marketing can deliver. So what do I want you guys to take away before we get Jonathan back up here for questions. What I hope you take away is that even in this difficult external environment, we continue to deliver consistent growth and it's because of our consistent acquisition strategy that is diversified so that in any environment, each one of the levers works uniquely. And finally, with the acquisition of Ameritrade, our value proposition only gets better, and we will, of course, continue to get better at what we do. So John, do you want to come on up and we'll take some questions.\nJonathan Craig : So I think we're got one already. We'd like to stand. So the chairs were removed.\nMichael Cyprys : Mike Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Just a question on the client experience. Where would you say Schwab and the industry is today in terms of the client experience compared to, say, leading industries on that front? And as client expectations are in part being formed from outside of financial services, how might Schwab and the industry close the gap there? And what actions might we see from Schwab over the next year or two on that front?\nJonathan Craig : Yes. That's a great question. I think you framed it well. I do think our clients -- any one of us as a consumer, our experiences, our expectations are often set by our best experience. Our last great experience that we had often frames our expectations for every future experience. And I think we in the financial services industry take that to heart, certainly, we at Schwab and recognize that there's opportunity to continue to get easier to do business with, which is why I focused on it so much. I think what's unique about the financial services space is the depth and breadth of what we offer in the serious of what we offer, the regulatory environment around it. So sometimes, some of our best thinkers will come and say, why can't we be like company XYZ and often that company might just rideshare copy. They might just do one thing, the same thing for all folks in a different regulatory world. So my response to that is we need to be as close to that seamless easy experience as possible, but we also need to recognize that we're doing something very different in a much broader way and a much more regulated way. So I would say it's a very high priority for us. It's a high priority for Rick. I know the entire retail leadership team. I think since we're making in digital that we deliver and we'll deliver a great experience, but it's an endless opportunity to do more for sure.\nMichael Cyprys : Because the message has been very clear, and you've had good results, but the $100 million that was cut, and I was just looking at the advertising expense, and you can see it down. So where did that -- where was that cut? And I think I have an idea, but just where was it cut in? What do you see? Were there any impacts? And just a follow-up, Jonathan, on the -- and being disruptive. Where are we? Are we fully -- are we at 8 out of the 10 and being aggressive there? Are we still near 3 or 4, and that's still to come.\nJonathan Craig : You go quick?\nStacy Hammond : Yes, I was going to say. So I mean you did hear from Jonathan, that the marketing synergy was incredibly significant. However, I believe that it's the power of the combined value propositions that will make every dollar will be able to speak to both affluent clients who are seeking a wealth manager and to traders or somebody who's simply looking for a place to place a trade. We're also delivering significant efficiency account, which gives me confidence that we're buying in the appropriate places in the appropriate way and sharing the appropriate messages.\nJonathan Craig : On bank lending, I'd say. So lending is a significant opportunity, significant priority. Growth has been good in both. Historically, mortgage has been a little bigger than PAL. Obviously, in a different market, I think we see a lot of opportunity in PAL over the next couple of years in mortgage as well. But again, that depends a bit on the interest rate environment. Our financial consultants are fully licensed compensated to talk about lending. Our clients are open to it without question. We market our lending capability. I would say we're all in as it relates to helping our investing clients with the liability side of their balance sheet as much as we can.\nMichael Cyprys : Cabot, KBW, the merittrade reps, and they're already offering Schwab lending products, for example. Just wondering, as the conversion happens this year, what additional opportunities does that unlock in terms of additional solutions that those reps can sell or our clients can get access to that'll continue to drive that increase in cross-selling?\nJonathan Craig : Okay. So the lending -- the ability to offer lending is very new. The wealth -- the brokerage part of the wealth management part has been throughout, well, 6 months now, at least. So both are very new. They do have access to the full suite of capabilities at Schwab. So the short answer is they have access to the full suite now. Having said that, it takes a while to understand the breadth of what we offer on the wealth management side. It takes a while to understand the banking as Rick mentioned, some of the processes right now since they're still green financial consultants. They're still supporting the TDA client in a TDA environment. It's not quite as seamless when they get over to Schwab. So the short answer is they have full access to everything now to talk to their clients about their Schwab employee, their clients or Schwab clients, it's going to be even easier. Eventually, when they're in a Schwab branch...\nMichael Cyprys : Number one is we've over a couple of different sections. We've gotten a few questions just about maybe initial reactions from yourself and the broader leadership team around the market structure proposal. So maybe if you had any quick commentary on that.\nJonathan Craig : Yes. Let me share a couple of thoughts from where I said I'm not the expert, but I think I probably represent the broader view generally. I think first and foremost, that Schwab, our focus is and has always been about the individual investor and what's best for the individual investor. And as we look at these market structure proposals, we are looking at them, of course, through that lens. It's early. We have provided some commentary and published a white paper. We have more to digest and we'll share more as the process unfolds. But I think the key thing for us is any change that happens, especially significant change in market structure has to benefit or at least in our mind, should benefit unambiguously the individual investor. If it does, it would make a lot of sense, we would support it. If it doesn't, obviously, we would have a different opinion. From what we've seen so far, I think we have some questions as to whether it really would benefit the individual investor especially relative to how we route orders today, which we have a lot of pride in around best execution. So I guess we'll have more to say as this unfolds. But for us, the lens is what's great for the individual investors, we'll thrive. Our revenue tied to all these proposals is a very small fraction.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. One more from Devin Ryan at JMP Securities. And this could be for you or Stacy. Embedded Finance is becoming a bigger theme across financial services and meeting clients where they are, as Stacy spoke to. How is Schwab positioned for this and maybe a little more insight into some of the opportunities you see on this front ahead?\nStacy Hammond : Sure. Great. I mean I think central to marketing is being where clients are, I can't expect them to come to us. And I think core to innovation is figuring out where clients are and how we can meet them efficiently. I think a really good example of that is the work that we do with education. So we want to show up where people are curious about investing, whether that is with paid media or with earned media. Of course, once they get to schwab.com, the experience is even more robust, but I can't expect them to start there. So a lot of what we do is think about where are investors, how can we be useful to them in the place that they are and then how can we be there when they need us. I think the second part of that would be about new channels. I mean, I think about the number of ways in which we have to communicate with investors today, and it's much more expansive than it was even 5 years ago using, for example, the podcasts using our digital magazine, -- there are all kinds of examples of making sure that we're creating content in a way that reaches people where they are as opposed to expecting them to come with us to come to us. We're trying to make it simple, as Jonathan referenced.\nJonathan Craig : I think we're -- I would agree, we will go to where the clients are and at the same time, often investing involves a multifaceted conversation tools, relationships in a lot of cases, that eventually leads to coming in a branch or a full show.com experience, but we'll go out to them where they are, and that's all tied to ease. \nJonathan Craig : So I think we're at time. I think I'm bringing up our friend and colleague, Bernie.\nBernard Clark : Our bias towards action when we all stand up about 15 minutes before we're supposed to be up here and lean against the wall and do circles. And we just like to be on the move and it's a little hard standing still anymore, but great to be here. I think Rich said it well in one of the breaks. This is often about what's up here, but it's more about what's down there when we're having conversations. And I hope to be able to turn this conversation around some of our performance in advisory services and with independent advisors into a conversation. So get your questions ready. There's a lot going on. And certainly, the one thing that's very, very consistent in the space is the success of it. Everything else seems to be changing, very much an evolving landscape. But -- and it didn't occur to me when I first asked for this. Everybody likes to talk about what we are and who we are and print articles and talk about that we're not there for something or we are there for something else. And so we thought it was really, really important as we were about to welcome in all of these new TD advisors that we told them who we are. And so I said to Tracy help me with this presentation. So let's start with the pledge that we put out there. What didn't occur to me at that point in time, and I was so happy we started with the pledge was the fact that when I launched the pledge, it was with all a few in February of 2020. And that just -- when I was sitting there thinking to myself, that must have been when we first put the pledge out. So it was that porpoAnd the 3 years that were mentioned in -- since we've been together living in this place. The a little box that we look at on our screen. But I want to remind everybody we have a pledge out to advisors, and it's so critically important because these are businesses. These are people who entrust their franchise to us as the custodian, and they don't know us, some 7,000 or 8,000 of them that are coming over. And maybe they've read some of the articles or have been told some of the stories about who we are, and that was the whole purpose of the pledge. What are we going to do now that we've taken this large share of the marketplace and how are we going to help them continue to grow their franchises. So most importantly, we are there for every advisor that's serious about being in business. We're not there for clubs and people who are just sort of kicking the tires or maybe have some powers of attorney on accounts. But if you're serious, we want to be in business with you. My job has never been to tell you when you're successful or what size you're at when you're successful -- so we have a lot of small firms. In fact, 80% of our firms are under $200 million. And we have far more small firms at Schwab before we even engaged ourselves with TD Ameritrade. That's important to remember. So there's no asset under management minimum we have. There's no custodial fees, and we don't plan on putting custodial fees in. Starting to hear through the industry about custodial fees as the economics get more challenged. And for some of those who don't have the opportunities that we have that don't have a bank, don't have the breadth of services and don't have the scale, they're starting to talk more about having asset management fees or custody fees, we have and will not have those. And we have no intention to introduce a minimum, I want to say this very clearly, nor do we have any intention of putting in a custody fee for advisors? -- best-in-class technologies. Christian asked me the question when we started , did you just embrace all of the TD technology? I think there was a belief out there that TD had a superior technology to what Schwab had. And I think in some cases, it was true. And in some cases, it wasn't. So you'll hear me talk more about this, but we took a look at both platforms independently and honestly and try to make sure we kept the best of both of what we were seeing. And we kicked the tires and all the APIs, and we'll talk more about that in making sure we could bring the services to advisors that they really needed. The best and brightest service professionals, I'm going to lay claim because I've been in this business for a long time now at Schwab. We have the best people. We have always known that this is a relationship business that never alluded us for a moment and making sure that we hire the best, retain the best and kept them in sea as long as we could before we had to promote them into even more broader roles to pursue their careers. We've been good at doing that. And technology is an augmenter really of those people and a deep relationship. After all advisors are in the relationship business, and they expect us to be in the relationship business with them. Practice management. We started this a decade ago, critically important, making sure that we're helping clients to grow their businesses. That's how we grow. Most of our growth is organic, as you can see from the numbers. And so making sure that we're out there, helping them to think about their futures, thinking about their successors, thinking about how they create firms that are multigenerational, has long been part of what we're doing. And I'm pleased to say that many of our TD colleagues now as they've joined us are recognizing, hey, that platform, we thought we had that as well yours a little better. You've got a little more than we had, and so it's all become additive. And then we talked about an account opening process that would be digital. Now -- the good news about this line item is it's not what I really I'm going to talk about further into this conversation. This was about making sure people understood we're not going to make you get wet signatures when we do this transition. This was about the ease of coming over that you've heard Joe talk a lot about, you've heard Jonathan talk about, which is a process that is well underway with advisors. That's what we meant by saying a digital process. I'm going to talk to you about a digital process we've now created for all the business that clients are winning and how successful it's going to be in the industry and it's going to revolutionize how you bring a new client to the firm and how easy we can make that for you to do it. I do want to stress that point, though, about as you talk about the transition. I'm not going to spend a long time on the integration. It is important to recognize that because these are businesses, our integration with advisors started 2 years ago when we first announced this. Advisors, we shut down the idea of having new advisors join the Ameritrade platform. They can put new accounts on the Ameritrade platform, but every new advisor at that point in time, joined the Schwab platform. And so we've -- we're well underway in the process of transitioning those over. So let's talk about the change in the industry. It's getting dramatic. And you could see the success we've had, as I said, that's the one thing that's been there consistently at 13% CAGR. I think I used to talk to you 3 years ago and through our virtual update, we used to talk a lot more about a 10% CAGR. Certainly, this has been a successful industry. It's drawing assets away. Jonathan mentioned some statistics about the retail market. We at Schwab all feel the same way. the assets, our growth is out there. It's not even necessarily with competitors. We have a small fraction of what is a very, very successful marketplace, and we are going to continue to exploit that in every way that we can. And as I think about what's going on in the marketplace and the growth that we've seen and the CAGR that we're enjoying, I think about everything that's happening from within that marketplace, M&A. There's -- you could argue, and I do often with our industry colleagues, there's a lot of M&A. Well, there's not really very much at all M&A at all. The truth is we did about 300 deals last year, but up about 5% from the year before, which is dramatically up from the year before that. But deals are happening constantly. -- firms are coming together, and they're coming together to grow. I think that's the important aspect of it. The M&A is being done because firms are seeing opportunities to merge together to create more centralized services to build scale, which is also important to advisors and maybe not -- had this debate with a client in my office the other day, maybe not as important to an advisory firm, but important. Certainly, fees are not going up for anybody, including advisors. And hence, we have to make sure that we can cover more assets with similar cost structures, and they're starting to get that idea as well. And as we continue to move forward in creating those opportunities for advisors, they will continue to bring more assets in. And the M&A that's happening within advisory firms is going to create more success within those firms. The concept you'll hear us talk about this a lot going on the -- going forward. The concept as rep as portfolio manager is starting to change. centralized services used to be done around operational functions. It's going to be a lot more, I think, about sort of the strategic and the more important relationship functions that are within a firm as we go forward. So we'll keep an eye on that, and we'll keep updating you on where we think that's going and the opportunities that we have. There's also a lot of capital coming into the space. It's been recognized as a successful place. Why wouldn't capital want to be here. You're seeing some of the likes of CI Financial coming in and acquiring firms in mass and with an intent to build those centralized services and scale. They've taken a lot of like firms and trying to create a capability there and doing it with advisors at the helm. Sometimes this is a retirement strategy. Quite often, what it is, is trying to create that multigenerational firm I talked about before. So you have 2 types of M&A there. You have money coming in, third parties acquiring in a successful way, I may say, and then you have advisors acquiring advisors. The thing that still alludes me, I've said this to you before, is I thought the M&A would focus itself more at the lower end of the market because of the complexities of regulation, the cost of operations, the ability to scale or the inability to scale a smaller firms, and it hasn't. M&A has really resided in the $1 billion space mostly, large successful firms coming together with other large successful firms. So we have to keep an eye on that and continue to monitor how that's going to change the landscape of what's going on. The target always being taking more assets away from the traditional models. That's the most important thing that can happen here. So as we continue to talk about the change that's happening, no one in this industry is staying in their lane. Everybody is looking to get involved in some other aspects of the business. Much of that, I think, has to do with chasing different revenue streams and opportunities. Some of it has to do with reaction to legislation and regulation or proposed legislation and regulation and trying to grab a spot there. We're seeing a lot of consolidation of providers. It's never been easier to go independent. And much of that is because fintech arrived on the scene in a big, big way. providers arrived on the scene in a product type way. And the open architecture nature of the independent space is really what's been driving its success. I may add that we are part of that open architecture in every particular case. Our capabilities sit right on the shelf, along with others, but the independence is what is so critically important to advisors, and we have to make sure that we're maintaining that. I think about what's going on with some of the providers like Envestnet announcing they're going to be in the custody business, I found that quite interesting. It's really hard to be in the custody business. I can attest to that. I remember when a competitor many years ago announced in November, they were going to be in the custody business with advisors by February and didn't laugh because we are paranoid, and we take everything quite seriously. But I knew that was impossible to build a platform of that magnitude. And I think to myself, why wouldn't Envestnet think they want to be in the custody business. And then I start to think a proposed regulation and legislation around outsourcing and what that could potentially mean. Interesting possibility Goldman talked about wanting to be in the custody business. I'm not so sure they're there any longer. This is a business you need to love in order to stay with it. I say that's a walk all the time. Can we love a business that's a 9 bp business, 9 bp net. And we are -- and we do, but it is a hard business, and it's a business that's taken us 2 decades to build in making sure that we can get all the capabilities that advisors want. I wouldn't quite say it's bespoke, but our job is making sure when an advisor has a need that we can fulfill unmet need. You've probably seen us go out, make a couple of passive investments. One pass one actually more of an ownership investment or investment in Dynasty. I think some of you may be curious about that. Dynasty is one of those solutions that exist in the marketplace that help to bring assets away from the more traditional models, not to demonize those models, but that's our job, trying to get more people interested in the independent space. And Dynasty has done a fantastic job in doing that. They have 25 of their firms on our platform as a custodian, and we've created a fabulous partnership along with them. And there's others in the industry, but they asked us if we like to be part of it Absolutely, we want it to be part of it. And so we made a nominal capital commitment to them in a passive kind of way because they're helping the industry grow. And who knows? Will we do more of those perhaps but it will have to be under the same kind of criteria as we think about it. Another deal we did recently was Family Wealth Alliance. In fact, just a couple of weeks ago, some of you asked me about that, we've become much, much bigger in the family office space. We now have 80 family offices that we cover through our model, 60 people dedicated to that. It's a really important space. Clients have more than doubled their size of accounts affluency, certainly driving up the change. And it's our job to make sure that we're creating capabilities that make sense for our family offices, many of which are multifamily offices, which were our clients already. And we had capabilities, but branding it has made a real difference in getting something like a family wealth advisor that's been around since 2003, with credibility covering 25,000 families, $450 billion in assets, not all on our platform either, which is kind of neat. And a guy like Tom Libergood, who created it that long ago, and we've been working with for the last decade as well, I think, is going to be very, very positive for us in continuing to penetrate that market from multifamily and into the single-family offices, getting exposure to those people. I opened by talking about the community and how important the community of people can be. Well, when you deal with family offices and many of you might not know this, the value of them is coming together more than anything. Often, their needs are economic, financial, but often not. -- security, travel, capabilities, services around the world. That's what they want to talk to other family offices about , and we then have the ability to bring them to bear in those conversations. And that's certainly going to make a big difference for us in penetrating those markets. So we're quite excited about being able to do more of that. And we'll look for those opportunities. These are not big M&A deals. They're additive to what we're doing. And if you look at FWA, family wealth Aliante, they look an awful lot like our consulting offer. So why not go out and get something that's in place and running and get into this place right away. And so to decide the consultative services that we've built over the past decade for premium firms and other firms throughout our network to make sure we continue to help them grow. So lots going on in that space. As we talk about the growth of the industry, one thing I would highlight to you, 15 straight quarters of 2:1 TOA ratios of assets coming away from others. That's a critically important dynamic that we have to continue to watch, bringing assets in, bringing in share of market, winning against our competitors. I would say our #1 advantage right now in the marketplace is capability. But most importantly, it's focus and consistency. We're in this business. Lots of other people say they want to be in the business. Lots of other people were in the business. Some other people are saying they're still in the business. I don't see the evidence of all of it. I see us with the assets that you can see on the right-hand side, half the firm's assets in this business, 1/3 of the revenue, this is really important business to Charles Schwab, and we're never going to forget that. I see lots of people smartly saying 13 CAGR, very successful place, lots of P&E capital coming into it. I want to be in that business. but can they get there? Do they really want to be there? Can they stay there, get there, stay there and be there through a lot of different economic climates, we can. We've got that scale, that earlier question from Christian. We clearly have that scale in this space. In fact, you can believe these numbers and not believe these numbers are all kind of bantered about, but Suruli talks about there being like 16,000 or 18,000 advisors. Conservatively, I will tell you that we are doing business with 85% of those advisors. Not always is the primary, but we have some form of business with 85% of advisors in the industry, and that's significant. And our aspiration is always to be the primary in every one of those relationships. So we'll keep stressing forward on all of those. Deal size, I talked about -- I did talk about the deal size coming to us. It's growing. Firms are larger when they come into the independents, but they're smaller as well. It's easier to be an independent. So we often see them come. Another sort of fun fact to side that, that we're seeing is there are twice as many transactions happening today that happened 2 years ago of $10 million or more generational wealth transfer is moving forward, and is moving forward at a very rapid pace. So if you think about our advisors being the same age as our clients, our clients are starting to pass their wealth on to that next generation, which is further stressing, I think, the industry to update itself and to make sure they're current for those next generation of assets. Sometimes they're going to a single individual, often they're being fragmented. Advisors are going to have to evolve. And because of that, we're also seeing the emergence of strategic firms in the industry. Firms that come together, I can mention a few, but you could think about high tower and focused financial. Firms that are very aggressive and trying to make sure their capabilities are staying current with the markets so they can continue to grow. And when I say their capabilities, usually it's an agglomeration of advisors and their capabilities. Let's be honest. As the market moves quickly and evolves quickly, it's not serving anybody well to be standing alone, and not taking advantage of a great custodian and the evolution of the business or perhaps taking advantage of an enterprise firm that's in the consolidation business, a mariner, the list is long as you go through. In fact, when we talk about deal flow, there's often 10 or 12 firms bidding for business that's in the marketplace. There's no shortage of demand and capability. And then you think about the other side of the marketplace, the independents or the IBDs -- they're here to stay. They've had some success. LPL talks about taking yet another run at this space. I think they've had great success in building models that help to retain the assets they've had, but can they attract assets. I think that's probably a question that remains. The regionals, Raymond James, they're out there. We still don't see a lot of success against the independent model, but they're trying. And so add them to the list of others who say they want to be in this space, they want to be in the independent space. And remember, you can always move to fee. That's probably the step 1 of moving to independents as a custodian, gets really, really hard when you start talking about open architecture product and you start giving up that revenue flow that comes with your captive product, your IPOs and your capital markets. And so I think you're going to see this only go so far that competition can come. We did $30 billion in net new assets in our new-to-industry assets, $18 billion of those came from wirehouses. So we're still continuing to see the success that comes along with that. And wirehouses again waffling just a tiny bit on, am I going to buy revenue flow? Am I going to rent revenue flow? Shouldn't I? Am I going to trade teams with other teams? And while they're doing that, good firms, large firms, in some cases, firms with tens of billions of dollars are just coming out into independent saying, I'm not playing that game anymore. I'm going to go out and I'm going to create a legacy here. I'm going to create a firm where I have terminal value in it that I can trade. I'm going to build a firm that can work for the people and the clients that I have. So we'll continue to see some of that growth. But with that, there's another challenge. When I talk to advisors, they always talk to me about technology and talent being their 2 #1 concerns, and they should. So we're heavily, heavily invested. I think we put $18 million since 2007 into university CFP programs, and university grants, not grants that necessary get our name on the door anywhere, but programs that are starting to bring help and capability into the marketplace, programs that are designed to make sure that their diversity of talent is getting better, whether it's ethnicity, sex, it is so important that we continue to move this industry to a place that represents the clients. And we've kind of been stuck, again, in most of the industry being post 55, a lot of [white male], not necessarily the demographic of the client base any longer. And so we're working hard at making sure that we're driving success into the universities at an early age and trying to create more opportunities in the historically black universities, certainly, other opportunities. The goal, if you look at this right now, the goal here, as I said to the team, is to try and get every state to have a blue that we can bring in. I remember when it was odd for us many years ago to have students that are impact events. So if you notice them there, there would be 10 or so wandering around, they'd be wearing school shirts. We now have 100 every year who come. And not only that, more importantly, everybody else at their conference started bringing students as well. If they hire 70,000 more people in the next 5 years, 70,000, where are they going to come from? How are we possibly going to do that unless we promote this at a very, very early part of people's career development. We're building a firm of the future while delivering on promises to clients, enhancing our control is critically important in this conversation. We had a little bit earlier, Michael and I were having this -- we're a $3.4 billion, $3.5 trillion franchise for advisors. We can't take risks with that, not because we can't as the firm Charles Schwab, which of course, we want to be very careful with. But our clients tell us, don't be a Page 1 headline. We can't afford to take that. We tell our clients their assets are safe with you. And so we have to have the right control as we bring these two teams together. And I will tell you, we did it with the people. We had lots of replacements, lots of people where we took our TD partners and replaced some of our Schwab partners, and then we have to do it on technologies as well. APIs are something that frequently comes to mind. We have 190 now. They're not all with TD APIs. They're not all with Schwab APIs, they are combination of we deem to be the absolute best in the industry. And we have a sandbox for those who want to come along and maybe try some stuff out with us. But we're not going to put that sandbox into production and jeopardize our clients, I promise you that. New launches, T. Rowe Price, institutional transaction fund, very important that's been waiting for some time. DocuSign 2.0, something that TD had that was really, really good and then the clients like we had to meet them with that one. We think we have a better solution coming through eSignature, but at the same time, we had to meet them now to make sure that they can continue to do their business. And of course, digital onboarding, as I keep talking about that, so important. As we complete the -- really the whole integration, sits top of mind for all of our strategies going forward, digital adoption, our culture, our people, efficiency, wealth management solutions and lending capabilities. Two things I'll highlight there. The digital -- it is a digital onboarding process for advisors. As I said to you at the beginning, it's going to revolutionize and I think it's going to bring a lot more business directly to Schwab because it's going to be ease of doing business is going to make such a big difference in transitioning assets is such a very critical to and lending. I know [Rich], Jonathan, everybody covered this pledged asset lending, so important to advisors right now. We're starting to get our legs under us there. We'll continue down that path. I think originations are going to be right there. And then business lending has to be on the horizon, right, a premier bank that can really serve these institutional firms. And as always, I will highlight to you, and this is just a fun story. I show the slide all the time. We do this all through our client size. We do this all with our clients. These are all clients in our advertising. You should see the glee on TD Ameritrade advisors when they pop up in a commercial. It's like 7 years ago when we first started doing it with the Schwab advisors, they love seeing their face up there on banners in commercials, and they've been coveting this opportunity for quite some time. So quite proud to see the firm coming together. As always, let's go to some questions.\nBenjamin Budish : Ben Budish from Barclays. You talked a little bit about generational wealth transfer. I was wondering if you could talk about maybe like attrition and also win rates when those sort of transfers are happening? I think it's kind of stood that that's sort of an opportunity time for maybe you're the next generation to make a change. To what extent you guys winning there versus seeing people potentially...\nWalter Bettinger : Win and we lose through our advisors. Advisors are adept at getting involved with families way downstream. And so they're keeping the assets. But what they need to do is they need to be building models within their slightly different way than they might have served the parents assets, right? I think virtual, I think this is one of the silver lines of COVID, I think we've learned a lot through all of that. I think they have an opportunity to create different portfolios for this group. Asset accumulation versus de-accumulation, if you will, is something that they're all starting to focus an awful lot more on. And I think M&A is going to play a little bit of a role in here too, in creating some more of those centralized services. Some firms are using junior partners and assigning them to the books of these smaller clients as well.\nBenjamin Budish : On the institutional space, you are an institution as well. It's been around for a while. But I guess one thing is on the -- this no load. I think we don't need to know the economics probably Peter will cover that. But in this last we see a jump up. It looked like the -- so could you just give us the strategic sort of the color behind that, and I'm sure we can ask Peter more the financial -- hardcore financial.\nWalter Bettinger : Well, advisors are continuing to load and something we should be talking about is their movement into alternatives, which has been quite prolific recently, using things like iCapital so important case management, just 2 examples of third-party platforms we have in that open architecture environment I mentioned. Clients don't want to pay transactions, and yet there's pressure on economics across the board. And so I think no loads are coming into the SEC has entered into it. They're class, best-in-class share is something that they're looking deeply into. And so I think you're seeing advisors now really revisit that, along with the fact that they're coming to realize that the idea is rep as the portfolio manager is something they need to move away from. That's going to be gradual, and it's going to take some time. But I think we're going to see more of that migration. And I think there's space there for us and other third parties and overlay-type management. I didn't mention iRebal and thinkpipes when I was going through some of those best of both worlds. But I think our model marketplace is going to play a very big role in the future as well. Our combined TD and Schwab...\nBenjamin Budish : Matters who they give it to...\nUnidentified Company Representative: Ben, will get there eventually, I promise.\nUnidentified Analyst: Just a 2-parter, Bernie, on the competitive landscape. Are you seeing any evidence that RIA consolidate becoming less aggressive given higher rates and growing interest burden. And you didn't really touch on what you're seeing from your larger RIA peers. Pershing is announcing this big launch with Pershing X. I was hoping you can give some perspective since it does appear that they're making some pretty meaningful investments to help accelerate growth within the RIA channel.\nBernard Clark : Rich has highlighted, I've been around a while. Yes. No, I am shocked by the interest that continues at very, very high multiples. I'm not sure that advisors they're a bit of an all twisted punch. I'm not sure the multiples are what they're moving them, and there are multiple bidders. So that continues. And I do think that firms are going to have to, in some way, change to that or find opportunity. And we're helping some of those consolidators to find opportunities and how they can build those businesses after to create some better economic if that's what they're after. But I do think the centralization of capabilities is what's going to be important in the future. But I don't see the flow going away.\nUnidentified Analyst: Pershing, Pershing X. \nBernard Clark : I almost hate answering that question because it always sounds like I'm a homer. But at the end of the day, Pershing X, it feels to me -- so I'll give you Bernie's opinions, right? It feels to me which is dangerous and I'm about to get run off the stage with and Fidelity, it feels like they're trying to go back to their DNA of being a fun company, everything is distribution. So that's how I look at our 2 competitors. Still fierce, still with great capability. I could probably tell you more about Pershing than I can about Fidelity because they hide behind that cloak of secrecy of not being public. But I will tell you that when it comes to we will not be outdone, when it comes down to longevity in the marketplace, we will not be outdone. And I think we may find ourselves doing business with Pershing X, and that's just fine. We can do that until we have a capability that's superior.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right. Here we go, Bernie. So in the industry slide, you talked about being roughly -- or the numbers suggest roughly 45% of the industry, the RIA industry. So that's an awesome achievement. I'm curious, the footnote looks like it suggested and included hybrid RIAs. So is that just their fee-based portion? Or is there a portion of that market that you wouldn't have access to? And as you become larger and a bigger portion, how do you continue to keep the growth going and not become kind of problem of -- a victim of your own success, if you will?\nBernard Clark : Well, the growth is still coming from outside of the space. So it's not an internal competitive space, right? We have about 1/3 of our clients that we call hybrids. I think the hybrid assets are excluded from that number, but it's reasonably de minimis. When someone comes to us, typically, what they're trying to do is grow themselves out of that revenue stream, and they're quite successful at doing. I just sat with a very large consolidator, I had this conversation the other day from the Midwest. And they're looking at the opportunities of how fast they can remove themselves because they can't be a truly fiduciary as long as they're hanging on to that commission space, right? And they have to keep the licensing and there's all sorts of stuff that comes along with that. So I think that's a de minimis amount. I think the amount of assets that make the most sense are probably the $8 billion to $10 trillion that sits in the wires. And we see a lot of advisors who are in the independent broker-dealer space who are finding themselves to what looks more like an 80:20. Indirectly, I would tell you some of these models that they're trying to hold assets on to in the IBDs are actually helping us because they're forcing advisors to the fee space. And then it's just a small across the street to us or independents in general -- I shouldn't say us, but the independents in general, it's once they get the fee. And if they have a little residual commission business, it can always be handled through -- there's a preponderance of independent broker dealers that can do that. \nBernard Clark : I think I'm out of time. No questions? Awesome.\nBernard Clark : So now I get the pleasure of introducing my friend and colleague who I sit before too. If I forget to introduce you, please just come up, Neesha Hathi. Neesha Hathi, many of you remember, had a cup of coffee with advisory services for a decade. So she's been a key part of ours. She runs wealth and advice solutions now, and she looks after everything in the firm having to do with that and certainly it's going to be a big aid to advisors as well on a going-forward basis.\nNeesha Hathi : Thank you, Bernie. And it's great to be here with all of you today. I know I'm the last thing between you and lunch. So I will keep it moving as I go forward. I think the last time I had the opportunity to spend time with you, I was in a different seat. I was our Chief Digital Officer. And so you might see a little bit of my digital roots, not to mention my advisor services roots come through. But I want to share today on what I'm really excited about, which is actually leading our newest enterprise Schwab, which is called Wealth and Advice solutions. And what I'm going to do is, I try to accomplish 3 things. First, I want to give you a little bit of a lay of the land. So what are all the capabilities that we have in this area around wealth and advice solutions. And you've heard a lot about this opportunity around wealth management today. So I want to bring some of that to life. Secondly, I want to talk about the actual opportunity -- and when you look through it -- look at that opportunity through our eyes, given the growth of these businesses that you've been hearing about all day, we really think that opportunity is tremendous. So a really great opportunity that we believe, we're very well positioned to pursue. And then finally, I'm going to talk a little bit about what are those priorities. So how are we actually going to go and pursue this opportunity and accelerate our growth in this area. So let's dive in. So as I promised, I wanted to start with the lay of the land. And the first thing I would start with is that in that One Schwab spirit that Walt talked about this morning is that our goal here is really to serve all of the clients at Schwab when we think about the wealth and advice solutions that we bring to market. So that includes our retail investors, of course, as well as our registered independent advisors and to a lesser extent, at least for now, our employers and the employees or the participants that work with those employers as well. There are three kind of major components to what we offer in this space. So of course, the investment solutions. So think about this as the building blocks of the portfolio, right? ETFs, mutual funds, separately managed accounts, alternatives. And of course, we have lots of third-party asset managers that we work with there, as well as of course, the proprietary offers that we have and many that we've acquired over the last few years as well. Then in the middle of the page, you see managed investing portfolio solutions. So these are not the building blocks, but these are the most holistic portfolio solutions that we offer. Here you have our flagship offer, our Schwab Wealth Advisory that you heard a little bit about earlier today, but also the great program that we have with our RIA clients, our Schwab Advisor Network, where we work with over 130 RIAs across the country and work with them to refer clients who are a better fit for a high-touch customized offer like what's offered through those RIAs. And then, of course, offers like Schwab Intelligent portfolio, it's premium, where we offer human access to a certified CFP, a certified financial planner, as well as digital advice. So really a robust set of solutions that we have when it comes to managed solutions or those portfolio solutions. And then when you get to the right side of the page, what you see are our experts, our specialty teams. So along with, of course, the building blocks and those portfolio solutions, we have a lot of experts in the house. And these are certified financial planners, folks that specialize in tax, [trust in the states], equity awards, all the various components that you would imagine. I think of these as the wealth management services that wrap around the portfolio, but a key part of the value proposition when you think about a client who's looking for help, guidance and advice as to how to get to better outcomes. And when you bring all this together, it's a significant driver of our revenue. Over $4 billion of our revenue come from the offers and solutions that you see on this page. So the really wonderful thing is that as you can see this big, broad, robust set of capabilities that we already have in the house, our goal is to deliver those capabilities to our clients. And what we know is that when a client engages with us, when they take advice from us, when they engage with us on a financial plan, we have happier clients. And the reason we have happier clients is because they have the confidence, they get the support, they get the guidance that they need to get to their financial outcomes. And the left side of this slide kind of illuminate some of that. So if we think about financial planning, and you heard Jonathan talk a little bit about the financial plans that we deliver. Financial planning is a key component, we think, one of the first steps for a lot of investors. When an investor engages with a financial plan and does a financial plan with us, not only are they more confident, but we see 12x the M&A of a typical retail client. If you think about our offers, Walt talked about this morning a little bit, managed investing, when a client actually is paying us a fee for advice they are more likely to have a higher CPS score. Actually, on average, an offer like Schwab Wealth Advisory has a CPS score of about 10 points higher than the average retail client. Average retail client, by the way, has an incredible CPS score, if you think about the industry out there. But our managed clients are even more excited about being at Schwab more likely to refer and more loyal. And loyalty is actually what the third point talks about, which is in that Schwab Wealth Advisory offer, when a client actually enrolls in that offer, they're much more likely to be retained at Schwab and actually stay in that offer. So they're having a great experience and bringing more of their assets to the offer and referring that offer to other of their friends and family. And then finally, at the bottom of that column, you see even when it comes to digital advice. When you think of digital advice, especially over the last few years is perhaps a more transactional client, perhaps a client that's really still kind of tiptoeing into advice. When we ask our clients how they feel about Schwab Intelligent portfolios, we again see a very high satisfaction rate. We know that clients, again, sometimes what they need is actually digital advice. Sometimes what they need is a consulting with the certified financial planner. And I think one of the real assets that we have is, we have all these capabilities in the house, and we're free to deliver advice and the guidance that they need in lots of different forms, not necessarily the traditional -- you have to have it all this way. At Schwab, you can have it the way that the client really needs. And it really does vary depending on the asset size, their personal needs, where they are in their life trajectory. So when clients engage with us when it comes to advice and guidance, we have happier clients. When we have happier clients, the great thing is we actually drive revenue for Schwab. And what you can see, if you look at the charts on the right side is that the advice solutions of the dark blue part of that bar chart, you can see is growing at a faster rate. Those are those solutions in the middle of the slide that I showed you previously. Those managed solutions when a client is paying us a fee is actually the higher growth area of our AMAF revenue. And also, as you can see by the revenue on client assets and attractive economics, so better, happier clients means with stronger growth for Schwab as well. So as you can see, it's already a robust business. But what I really get excited about is talking about the opportunity because this is a growing opportunity and probably not surprising. As the information out there as investors are hearing all this information about how they should live their financial lives, what good advice looks like, what they should be doing with their portfolio, more and more investors are looking for help and guidance. And actually, I think Rick talks about it as a bull market for advice. What you can see on the left side of this chart, and by the way, this is a Cerulli data, is that more and more investors, no matter what their segment is so, whether they're self-directed or more advice-seeking, you can see that, that's up into the right. They're more and more often looking for advice. And at this point, across the industry, 61% of investors are saying that they're willing to pay for advice, not just looking for it, they're willing to pay for advice. So what we look at is we say, well, that's a great opportunity across the industry. But what about our clients? How do our clients feel? Well, when you look at the right side of the slide, we see a really great opportunity. So when you ask -- when we ask our own clients, our Schwab clients and say, would you be willing to pay for advice? We actually do this in an investor profile survey that we do regularly. Are you willing to pay for advice? 37% of our own Schwab clients are willing to pay us for advice. And by the way, the dark blue bar chart shows you that only 11% of those households actually do pay us for advice. So we have a real opportunity here where we have clients who are saying that they want advice and only 11% that are actually paying us for advice. And actually, we talked a little bit earlier, there was a great question in the audience here around Ameritrade clients. And are they more trading-oriented and would they be willing to pay for advice? Or how is -- how are all these wealth management solutions going to resonate with them. When you ask that same question, would you be willing to pay for advice, you actually get a number not much lower than what we see from the Schwab Blue side. 31% of Ameritrade clients are willing to pay for advice, and only 2% are currently paying for advice. Now not really that surprising, if you think about Ameritrade's focus was not necessarily in wealth management, some of the capabilities that they had, but when you think about the opportunity as you bring them into the Schwab universe, it's really tremendous. The other thing I'd point out is that we know that likely those 31%, they're actually getting that advice somewhere else. We talked earlier about the share of wallet opportunity. So not only is this an opportunity to engage them in advice, provide them that great experience, but also consolidate those assets that are probably being served somewhere else. So that's a little bit about the retail opportunity, but we also see opportunity on the advisor side, as well as with employers. And let me start with the advisor space. Bernie alluded to this a little bit. And if you think about the RIAs out there, many of them for many years have been looking to outsource more of their back office -- so there's been a trend over time, outsourcing the technology, maybe portfolio management, performance reporting, some of those things that they sell as administrative. But for many years, they were somewhat reluctant to think about outsourcing what they would call maybe their secret sauce, investment selection, portfolio construction, that was something that they wanted to keep closer to home. But what's happened over the last years is actually a change in that dynamic as advisors are realizing that their core value proposition is not necessarily in that part of the value proposition and actually is more about the relationship and all of those wealth services that they can provide outside the portfolio management. There's an increasing trend for advisors to outsource investment management and investment selection, portfolio construction. And what that means for a provider like Schwab is there's an opportunity for us to leverage all the great platform that we have as well as this great capability around asset management, wealth solutions to actually bring those things together so we can actually help serve more of those advisor needs as they continue to move towards -- forward on this trend towards outsourcing. On the right side of the page, what you see is the opportunity in the workplace environment. As we talked about a little bit earlier, workplace is an opportunity where we have more and more employers out there who are looking to serve their employees in a broader way. So think about what the pandemic did. You think about a lot of employers wanting to help their employees not only with their physical health, but also with their financial health, and so employers today they're one of their #1 areas of focus is financial wellness. This was quite different than it was many years ago. But what that results in is employers are more and more looking for providers to provide more help and guidance to their employees. That could look like a financial plan, that could look like a portfolio, but it -- but it is a higher level of service than just managing the portfolio. And this demand is actually not only coming from the employers, but actually the employees themselves. So if you look at the top of this right side, you see that there's demand growing because it is their primary relationship, right? For many people, their 401(k) is their primary service provider. Their primary relationship and financial services is with that 401(k) provider. And so they're looking for more help guidance and often, they're looking for more personalization, too. So as you can see, we look at this wealth and advice opportunity very broadly. There's a great opportunity with retail clients. We have had great opportunity with RIAs as well as with employers and the participants. And what I think is really exciting is that we are really well positioned for this. If you think about what a person looks for in a financial services institution and what Schwab stands for and what we're good at, where our competitive advantages lie, there's a really good match. First of all, trust. Schwab has been recognized as one of the most trusted brands in the industry. And when you think about advice, yes, you want to have a trusted relationship with your financial services provider. But if you're going to take advice from them, that's an elevated level of trust that you're going to need to have. And so our position here as a trusted provider is really important. Secondly, this combination of digital and human -- and I think this is a really interesting area of focus because more and more investors, sometimes driven by the pandemic, but it was a trend that was happening already are seeing the value of both -- the power of both. And I think we've talked about this quite a bit, but when it comes to areas of wealth management, I think we're really just scratching the surface. When you integrate the expertise of humans and bring technology to the back end of that and digital experiences to the front end of that, I think we can do some really powerful things and no firm is better positioned to do that given our strengths than Schwab. The third I would say is value. And I think this is something we all know that Schwab stands for value. This is our -- one of our core competencies, and this is something that we really believe is a principle when it comes to what we deliver to investors and advisors. But if you talk to investors about why don't they get professional advice. So for the investors that are not getting professional advice. The #1 reason, I feel confident in my decisions. Well, great. If they feel confident in their decisions, great Schwab is a great place for them. But the #2 reason is fees and costs. And so we know that there's a population of investors that are out there that want advice that see the need for it, but are may be turned off by the fact that they're not sure if the fees are going to justify that the value that they get. And that is something that we have an incredible strength in doing. And then finally, the one-stop shop. And I kind of look at this in two ways. One is that we know that there's a growing population of investors that are looking for their investing their wealth, their banking all to be in one place. And by the way, this is not only younger investors, we see that same trend in higher net worth individuals. But I think the other part of this is something that Stacy was talking about earlier when we talk about newer investors because what Schwab can do is actually be with an investor throughout their life journey. A lot of firms are going to want to come in and talk to an investor once they're a high net worth investor. And what we have the opportunity to do is actually work with an investor throughout that life journey. When they're a self-directed trader, maybe they don't have a lot of assets, but then they're thinking about stepping into advice, thinking about maybe a nondiscretionary solution, we can be with them across that journey. And I think that's a real powerful differentiator and helps us stand apart. So what are we going to do? So how are we going to go after this opportunity? So let me talk about 3 areas that we're focused on. So first of all, introducing more clients to wealth and advice solutions. And this is -- we talked about this quite a bit already today. But when we think about those millions of TD Ameritrade investors that are out there, that we are going to be bringing on to the Schwab Blue platforms, we have a real opportunity to introduce them to this broad suite of solutions that I shared with you, and we'll be doing that in lots of different ways. Of course, there's digital capabilities that we have. They have welcome experiences, and we talked a little bit about that earlier, but lots of different ways that we can introduce them to these solutions, not to mention all of those green or Ameritrade financial consultants. As we talked about earlier, a lot of those consultants have now been -- they're now duly registered, they're able to talk about these wealth management solutions, but the process is still pretty clunky. They have to actually help their client navigate to the Blue platform, the Schwab platform to actually open that managed investing account. Once we bring them over on to the Schwab Blue platform, all that friction goes away. And the early indications as we work with those financial consultants is really, really exciting. Those are financial consultants who have recognized for years, Ameritrade was a great place for trading, but maybe they weren't quite able to follow through on the rest of the needs that client had. And when they look at that Schwab Blue, that Schwab solution set of wealth and advice solutions, they get very excited about that opportunity to serve their clients in a more holistic way. In the middle column is really around enhancing our offerings, and we have a lot of work to do. We have a great offering, but we have a lot of opportunity to do more. And this is again where traditionally in this industry, when you think about managed accounts, managed investing tends to be a more paper-centric type of experience, tends to be all about the human expertise, and we believe a lot in the human expertise for sure. That is the center. But we also know that we can do a lot around that human expertise to create a better experience. And this really is an area that's very win-win. We know that clients want digital and human experiences. So it's a better client experience. We know that our field, so whether it's a financial consultant, a wealth advisor, a tax in the states attorney. we know that they all are dealing with the same friction in the process, whether it's paper, it's process, it's manual work. And we have the opportunity to really bring a lot of automation to that. And then, of course, it's a win for Schwab because as we scale these processes, we really have an opportunity to bring a lot of efficiency to these different types of offers that we have. As we brought this organization together, one of the obvious opportunities is you have Schwab Wealth Advisory, you have Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, you have Schwab Advisor Network, you have all of these various opportunities -- various offers out there, and we have a lot of opportunity to bring those things together in a much more holistic way for investors. That's really -- we believe, is going to resonate. I'll also touch on the bottom of that middle column around Schwab Wealth Advisory. So Schwab Wealth Advisory is one of our long-standing, we used to call a Schwab Private Client, but rebranded it just about a year ago. Schwab Wealth Advisory is one of our flagship offers. It's a nondiscretionary offer. And if you think about, again, our heritage client, a self-directed client or even an Ameritrade client, a self-directed client, a nondiscretionary offer is a great way for a client to step into advice. They may start a self-directed client and then say, \"I could really use sounding boards, someone to talk to you, someone to give me some advice, but I'm not quite ready to hand over the keys\" this is our great solution for that. And so Schwab Wealth Advisory has grown as a nondiscretionary solution. But what happens off it is, after a client works with Schwab Wealth Advisory for some period of time, one of the most common requests, actually the most common request is, well, can you just now do this for me? Can you just now manage the portfolio? It was great. I got your advice. I trust you. This is working for me. Now could you take this on? And we've never had a discretionary option within Schwab Wealth Advisory. So we are in the process of building that offer. And that will help us be able to serve those clients as they move into that phase of wanting more discretionary management. So again, back to that life journey, you can imagine the client starts out as a self-directed client, they decided to step into advice through maybe a nondiscretionary experience. And then as they become more comfortable, discretionary experience is available for them. So really a great opportunity for us to continue to broaden the way that we serve investors in this space. And then finally, the right side of the slide here talks about expanding our capabilities, and I won't spend much time here so we can get to questions. But Schwab personalizes indexing, we've talked quite a bit about, we'll be introducing new digital capabilities for both retail and RIAs to expand the capabilities there, more personalization capabilities. And I'll touch on Model Market Center, Actually, Bernie just talked about it for a second. But Model Market Center is another great example of a capability that was on the Ameritrade side that we are bringing on to the Schwab Blue platform. And if you think about Model Market Center, it sits on iRebal, but again, back to the outsourcing trend that I showed you for RIAs, it allows us to actually present to advisors, third-party models as well as, by the way, [sesame model], so Charles Schwab Investment management models to advisors so they can actually get more scale in that investment management process. And we're going to continue to invest and improve those capabilities over time. So I hope you walk away from this taking away a few things. One, we have a robust business in wealth and advice, and it's growing quickly. Secondly, we have an even bigger opportunity. If you think about the retail opportunity, the RIA opportunity, and again, we didn't spend too much time on it, but the opportunity we have in the workplace as well. We have these great assets around wealth and device solutions that we can deliver to clients no matter what channel that they're in. And then finally, that we have a lot underway to improve our performance, which has already been quite strong, but improve our position in the future. We really believe that this is an area that we can excel, and we can leverage all of the core competencies of Schwab to do so. So with that, I'm going to pause and see if we have any questions.\nMichael Cyprys : Mike Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. I was hoping you could elaborate a bit on the new discretionary management product that you're going to be rolling out for retail customers this year that you alluded to. Just maybe you could expand upon that? What are the economics for Schwab? Can you talk about the value proposition and how that's differentiated from other offerings in the marketplace?\nNeesha Hathi : Yes. As I mentioned, we have very large offering with Schwab Wealth Advisory. And it is a nondiscretionary offering. And the opportunity that we see is actually to introduce discretion to those clients who are asking us for discretion in that offer. And so it is a discretionary offer that will be part of Schwab Wealth Advisory. It's not a new offer. It's not going to have a new brand. But it will be a very robust digital experience, robust capabilities underneath, and it's something that we're going to be building out over the next couple of years. But it is, I think, a real important key element of making sure that we have advice solutions across the spectrum of our clients' needs.\nUnidentified Analyst: You talked about the gap between those who pay for advice, and those who are willing to pay for advice. Can you elaborate more on why that gap exist, and what is it specifically that you'll do, and kind of timeframe you expect to kind of close that gap over time.\nNeesha Hathi : Yes, of course. Yes, it's a great point. And I think when we look at that data, we all get very excited and say, well, why aren't these clients coming to us and saying, knocking on the door. I think there's a few reasons for that. One is really awareness. And part of that is we have, of course, all the Ameritrade clients who haven't had access to these. So these products and solutions, so they're just becoming aware. I think the second is that we have -- we've grown pretty tremendously organically as well. So we have lots of Schwab clients who maybe came in as a self-directed client, and didn't even know that, well, Schwab's capabilities around this. So there really is a significant opportunity around just awareness. Our heritage is serving clients directly and being a place for self-directed investors is certainly something that's a strength. But in this area also gives us opportunity because we have the opportunity to tell them about these other things that we do. I think the other thing is we have an opportunity to enhance our offers. And as I mentioned, making some of those offers more digitally capable, adding some more capabilities that will resonate with clients is something that we're focused on doing, and you're going to see a lot more about that over the coming years. And then finally, I think that there's -- when you ask if someone, are you willing to pay for advice, what they might be thinking about advice might be different than what our industry thinks about it as advice. And I think one of the reasons why I think that we are so well positioned at Schwab is that we have lots of different tools in the toolkit and a really great scalable model to be able to deliver that advice in the way that makes sense for the client. So I'll give you an example of this. Traditionally, in our industry, wealth management solutions are delivered with asset-based pricing. One of the things that we did with Schwab Intelligent Portfolios Premium is to create a subscription model. And that allows the client perhaps who wasn't comfortable or didn't like that idea of asset base pricing to engage with us in a different model. You could also imagine that there might be clients who say, \"I'm willing to pay for advice, but I don't want to enroll in something forever. I want advice kind of in moment-in-time, we call moment-in-time advice. And so we have all these experts, all of these capabilities, and our opportunity is to look at that population that is saying they're willing to pay for advice and figure out how is it that we deliver that advice to them in a way that resonates with them. But the wonderful thing is we don't have to go out and prospect a single additional client in order to do that. Of course, we're going to keep growing that engine at Schwab and continue to bring new clients in. But all of that opportunity already exists right within the Schwab House. So I'm going to introduce -- I didn't see you up there. I'm going to bring back, Jeff.\nJeff Edwards : Sorry, [Stephen]. So we do have a short kind of working lunch break. The food will be right out the door that you guys came in this morning. You can grab your lunch, stretch your legs. If anybody wants to stick around for Peter, he will be here presenting some materials and trying to take a few questions. So -- but no pressure. So yes, just follow this way, pick up, your name should be on the lunch, but feel free to reach out to any questions. And we'll see you guys back in about 10, 15 minutes. [Break]\nUnidentified Company Representative: We're in the home stretch. Please welcome Peter, Crawford.\nPeter Crawford : Right. Excellent. Well, thank you very much the home stretch indeed. And thank you. It looks like most of you came back to hear my session. I feel honored and delighted and hopefully, I won't disappoint. Great to see so many familiar faces here and see the familiar backs of the laptops here in the room and here in Dallas. And I also want to thank all of you up there out in the web for joining us for this multi-hour webcast. I know we're all at this point, tired of doing a long webcast, but hopefully, we've made it worth your while and giving you a lot of good information about the company. So by now, you've had a chance to hear from my colleagues about the strong momentum we have in the market despite investor sentiment that has been decidedly negative about the progress we're making on the Ameritrade integration and our excitement about the considerable opportunities that the combination enables about our ambitious but achievable agenda to create and to continue building the premier wealth management platform for retail clients and for RIAs. And finally, about our confidence in sustaining this enviable level of organic growth we've been able to deliver. So in my time today, I'll recap yet another year of record financial performance in the face of a mixed environment that featured both headwinds and tailwinds. I'll also provide some more empirical data and some more information analysis around our clients' behavior with regarding to their cash and explain why we're confident that this behavior will abate during 2023. And we'll see at some point this year a resumption of deposit growth. And finally, I'll talk about our outlook for 2023, a year that Walt described in his comments as a transitional year. A transition for our economy as the Fed seems poised to pause this tightening cycle, a transition for our organization as we shift our focus beyond the integration to the considerable opportunities that this union creates and a transition for us as well from our financial performance. As we're poised to produce revenue growth that may be a little bit lower than what we've seen in the last couple of years, there's a [head] even, and this is really important, even if rates fall in the outer years as many expect. So let's talk about some of the factors that contributed to that record financial. So it's a year ago at this meeting, it was virtual, but we laid out our scenario for the year. And the scenario used -- assumed a number of pretty conventional assumptions. And most important of which was the expectation at the time by the market that we'd see 75 basis points of Fed increases over the course of 2022. Now of course, the year unfolded very, very differently than we, or pretty much anyone else expected, with the Fed actually hiking rates 75 basis points almost every meeting, but every other key measure falling over the course of the year. [Natural] performance reflected the resilience of our business model amidst these combination of headwinds and tailwinds. Revenue increased by 12% year-over-year, a function of our expanding net interest margin, which more than offset the decline in client cash balances and margin balances and trading and, of course, the impact of the declining equity markets. We contained our expense growth despite that revenue outperformance and continued high inflation and increases in some third-party pass-through fees, we contained our expense growth within the range that we communicated. And that combination produced a 50% adjusted pre-tax margin, our highest best year ever and 20% growth in adjusted earnings per share to $3.90. Turning our attention to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet reflected the reaction by our clients to the dramatic increase in rates. As they move some of their uninvested cash off our balance sheet into higher-yielding alternatives oftentimes with our active help and encouragement. Total balance sheet assets declined 17% for the year, driven by declines in both bank deposits as well as payables to brokerage clients. While we finished the year with roughly $17 billion of FHLB advances and other short-term borrowings. Now within interest-earning assets, we saw a 28% reduction in margin balances, a function of the more negative investor sentiment as well as higher rates. But we did see a 17% increase in bank loans owing to a lot of what my colleagues talked about. Despite the higher rates, we continue to have a remarkably strong pipeline of loans certainly relative to those pre-pandemic levels. Now our stockholders' equity declined function of declines in our available for sale mark-to-market unrealized declines in our available-for-sale portfolio. Of course, those don't impact our regulatory capital. So with that, despite that, our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio climbed 100 basis points to finish well above our operating objective of [6.50]% to [6.75]%. Now we've talked for years to do 2 things: to deliver strong financial performance top line growth, organic growth, and at the same time, deliver significant capital -- return significant capital to our stockholders. And I think 2022 demonstrated our ability to do all that, because even as we were producing that record financial performance, we increased our dividend. We bought back 47 million shares of stock, and we redeemed $1 billion by our outstanding preferred. That is growth plus -- we talked about growth plus capital return. 2022 was a great example of growth plus capital return. Now it's been just over a year since we closed the acquisition of Ameritrade. And my colleagues have talked about the strategic benefits of that acquisition, and also about the considerable revenue and expense synergy that it unlocks. And those are certainly the most important aspects of the deal. But the union of these 2 companies also creates a company with a more all-weather diversified business model. And I think it's helpful to see that to compare our performance in the fourth quarter this year to the first quarter we were a combined company with fourth quarter 2020. Now remember, that was a period of time when we had been enjoying an unprecedented level of trading activity, a function of the COVID and the introduction of a lot of newer investors into the category. So our financial performance in that fourth quarter was the best financial performance in our company's history. And since then, equity markets have fallen. We've seen trading activity has about a -- over a 30% increase in revenue. Over 40 -- 45% increase in adjusted earnings per share, we increased our pretax margin by roughly 600 basis points in just those last two years. So I mentioned in the CFO commentary last week that we've entered what we believe is the later innings of the client cash sorting cycle. I said not the -- It's not the Mariano Rivera innings. This is not necessarily the last inning, but the later innings of this cycle. And so we wanted to build off the commentary we provided at the fall business update to explain this and explain why we're confident this is the case. And while again, we'll see a resumption of the balance sheet -- or the deposit growth over the course of 2023. So our clients -- recall that our clients tend to keep a certain level of transactional cash in their accounts for liquidity purposes. And as their cash levels approach those level, the cash that we received from new accounts offset any lingering sorting activity that we see in the existing accounts. And this is a graph that explains how that looks. Now this is a particular wealth tier, a particular tier of clients who have, for example, between $1 million, let's say, $1 million and $2.5 million of total assets in their account. We've done this analysis across 30 different wealth tiers, across 5 different client segments and the pattern is exactly the same. And what you see and what these lines represent is different cohorts of clients within that well tier based off of how much cash they had at the beginning of the rising rate cycle. And so the upper one, of course, has more cash and lower one has less cash. And again, we've done this for multiple we've shown 2 here, but we've done this for multiple cohorts of clients based off of their cash levels. And what you see, of course, is that as interest rates increase, those cash balances for that entire cohort start declining, but they don't decline to zero. They declined, they sort of converge around this, we call here an equilibrium line or what we called previously that floor. And really importantly, the pace of that decline, the pace of that sorting roughly corresponds to the distance they are from their cash levels are from that equilibrium level. Now that may not be totally cash with clients whose cash balance are below that level at the outset of the rising rate cycle. And what we see there is their cash balances actually increase. And this is why we say you better to think of this more as an equilibrium versus a floor. The point is even clients who start up with low cash even as rates are increasing -- even as rates have increased by 400-plus basis points from last year. They're actually increasing the level of transactional cash level of cash on our balance sheet during that period of time. Again, we supports this idea that there is this equilibrium level of transactional cash that clients want to maintain. Now we've seen this -- we saw this pattern in the last rising rate cycle, and we've seen it in this rising rate cycle as it is holding true here. There's another example of another demonstration of the existence of that equilibrium level. And each of these lines represent a group of clients who place their foot during that month. And what you see is they place -- they start using purchase money funds, and they basically reduce their cash level to a certain equilibrium level. And then they're content with that. It doesn't go to zero. You stay at that level. And regardless of when they start that process, they all end basically in the same place. Then there is this level of transactional cash within the different accounts. And of course, it varies based on how much assets they have in their account. But each of those have a pretty consistent level of equilibrium transaction cash they want to have on their account. So what we've seen is that the sorting activity that we have seen thus far follows almost identically cycle. It's following the same behavior, the same behavior that we saw from the 2015 through 2019 cycle. And we continue to believe that the magnitude of the sorting activity for existing clients will be not that much different from what we saw in the previous cycle. And therefore, at some point, during 2023, that sorting activity will continue to slow, and it will be offset by organic cash that comes in via new accounts, and we'll see a return of deposit growth. So our success in 2022 puts us in a great position as we head into 2023. But even so, there are, as always, a number of -- which we have various degrees of control. So now for the long waited much anticipated scenario. There's clearly a debate in the market about what's going to happen with Fed policy and frankly, even a debate between what the market expects and what the Fed expects. And so rather than try to take a stand on that debate, we put together first one roughly follows the forward curve, market expectations for 2 rate increases at the beginning of the year and then a rate cut at the end of the year. And the second dot plus, so three Fed hikes over the course of the beginning of the year held constant throughout the year. And then those different scenarios share a handful of common assumptions. One is that deposit betas that continue to be below. Second is end of period -- or December average interest-earning assets down between 8% and 12% from the end of 2022 with a portion of that decline being our expected reduction in some of those temporary funding sources by December. Third is we're calling BDA breakage fees. This is a breakage fee that we incur. It [counts] as a contra revenue from removing the third-party fixed rate balances from the BDA. Now we pay a breakage fee as we do that. These are fixed rate balances. We have the opportunity to reinvest those now prevailing higher yields or use that to offset higher cost funding. And then a capital payout ratio a well in excess of 100% for the year. And you can see for those two scenarios in the lower scenario, we'd expect to produce revenue growth in the 5% to 7% range. On the upper scenario 7% to 9%. Both scenarios we'd anticipate a change, which I'll talk about more in a moment with an adjusted pre-tax margin of 48%, 49% or potentially a low, but better than that. So let me talk about the different components that go into these -- we'll start on the revenue side with our net interest margin. Assuming that rates follow the forward curve, and actually, when we see -- we potentially see a rate declines in the outer years, we would see our net interest margin climbing into the low 2 6s by the fourth quarter of 2023 on a path to exceed 3% by the end of 2025. If interest rates are falling, how could that be? And the reason for that is because our fixed investment portfolio -- fixed investment securities portfolio, much of that was purchased during the period in 2020, 2021, when -- you see on the right here, the average yield on those securities. And so as those securities pay down, mature, et cetera, we have the opportunity to reinvest those proceeds in the market. So rates could follow. I mean these yields are more than 300 basis points lower than they are today if we were to replace those securities. So rates could still fall and we still have a nice opportunity to pick up yield as that investment -- fixed investment portfolio turns over in the outer years. Now that 7% to 8% adjusted expense growth is certainly a little bit higher than our long-term average that we've allowed in our -- over our history, but it puts us in a really good position to limit expense growth in '24 and '25 to no more than 5% per year as we harness the remaining expense synergies from the Ameritrade integration. Schwab DNA. It's one of the hallmarks of what you can count on for Schwab for much of our history. We are on a multi-decade journey to drive our expense on client assets ever lower. We see it as a really important competitive advantage when we don't want to -- we certainly don't want to take it for granted. The #1 way you can drive EOCA, expense on client assets, lower is to grow. And the way to grow is to do right by clients. And so there's always a balance between managing expenses in the near term while making appropriate investments in our clients and our business to support long-term growth. I think our track record speaks our ability to find that balance, our ability to grow, to drive down EOCA over time and to deliver operating leverage through the cycle so does the expense growth. So we start with our GAAP spending last year of $11.4 billion. And we deduct about $1 billion of integration expense and that gets us to our adjusted expense number. And we layer on top of that what we call fundamental operating expense. This is our sort of normal routine expenses to support our growing client base to handle moderating but still elevated levels of inflation and to advance the strategic agenda that my colleagues talked about. Now this year, we have -- on top of that, we have other institutions have talked about a 2 basis point increase in the FDIC premium. We expect that to add about 0.5 point to 1 percentage point to our growth rate. And then this next item is one I talked about last year, and I don't expect I'll be talking about it next year, but these are basically integration-related spending that's still included within our adjusted expenses. There's really three components to that. One is software that we're developing for the integration. Joe talked about that, all the work for example we're doing on to bring thinker slim over to sit on top of the Schwab platform. The software we're doing to ensure a smooth client experience. Second component is hardware, which we -- most of which we added last year to support the combined client base at conversion to support growth in the years ahead. And we're admittedly a bit conservative in terms of the capacity we added, but this will allow us to decommission a lot of the legacy Ameritrade hardware. And then the third is something that Jonathan talked about, which is temporary surge staffing to handle what we expect to be a high volume of calls around the conversion events. And so you put all those together, and that adds about 2 to 2.5 percentage points of growth. Benefit of the synergies -- most of these are the synergies that we -- or actions we took in 2022, and we got the full year benefit of them in 2023. And that's how you get to this number, our expectations for the year. So before I close, we're certainly gratified by the financial performance of the company over the last couple of years. I think those of you who have followed this company for a long period of time, and I think that includes pretty much everyone in this room, know that we don't manage the company quarter-to-quarter. We have a long-term orientation, which is borne of our confidence that our Through Clients' Eyes strategy has delivered and should continue to deliver for clients and stockholders over a long period of time. And so before we close, I wanted to zoom up from the conversation around 2022 and 2023, and look at how that financial formula we've talked about in the past has performed at last -- and it starts, of course, with our Through Clients' Eyes strategy, our competitive positioning, generating strong, consistent organic growth, which when you combine that with the low double-digit asset growth. Through our business model, the combined banking, brokerage and asset management, we're able to assure in some parts of our business with win-win monetization opportunities elsewhere, converting that level of asset growth an equivalent level of revenue growth. By managing our expenses to grow at a pace slower than the growth in revenue, we're able to expand margins and generate even faster growth in earnings. And then by being thoughtful around how we manage our capital. We're able to generate even stronger growth in our earnings per share. How has that done over the last 20 years? Certainly quite well. So that financial formula has absolutely delivered for clients and of course, delivery for stockholders for the last 20 years. It starts, of course, with our ability to grow assets. And both Walt and Rick talked about the strong organic growth and how we've been able to sustain that organic growth even as we become a bigger firm. That is the key ingredient here. It's that Through Clients' Eyes strategy disrupting they do that. We focus on our clients. They reward us with more of their business, and they also refer their friends to us. Over time, we've overcoming the decline of equity -- long march of equity commission to zero and the shift from a lot of client assets from mutual funds into ETFs trading and asset management fees, all without taking any material credit risk. Now net interest revenue is, of course, the product of net interest margin and our interest-earning assets. And as we've seen in the last 9 months, those can sometimes move in different ways. It can be cyclical, but Sickle cyclical will go in opposite directions. But the point is because of that, we're able to grow together. By thoughtfully managing our expenses, we've been able to increase our margins over time. And then by being equally thoughtful in terms of how we manage our -- very efficient in how we manage our capital. We've been able to reward our stockholders by increasing our dividend and by opportunistically buying back our stock with a payout ratio over the last 5 years. Let me just close with a couple of thoughts. Almost $430 billion in net new assets, a 12% increase in revenue, 20% -- 50% adjusted pre-tax margin. We're certainly proud of the financial performance of the company, especially in light of what has been a challenging environment for many companies. I'd say we're even more proud about how we've been there for our clients during this tough period of time. Somebody asked me the other day recently kind of what's the investment thesis for Schwab today? And I said the investment thesis for Schwab today is the same as it's been for much of our history. It's not just a bet on higher interest rates or a snapback in the equity markets. Well, certainly, both of those would be beneficial to our business. Rather, it's the confidence in a company whose strategy and who is operating in financial performance -- function of our strategy were no trade-offs positioning of the millions, now tens of millions of client promoters we have among our client base and our leading position in the two fastest-growing segments of Wealth Management, the RIA channel and the retail brokerage channel. It's a company that has been consistently able to turn that asset growth in resilient business model, a company that doesn't take credit risk. A company that is thoughtful about how it manages expenses. That does always mean growing expenses at the lowest rate in the industry necessarily. It means striking that careful balance between delivering in the near term and making appropriate investments that will drive long-term growth, long-term success for our clients and for our business. And a company that recognizes that it\u2019s not our capital, it\u2019s our stockholders' capital, and always being very, very mindful and being very, very efficient. That\u2019s been the investment thesis for much of our history. And I think that -- I'm very confident that will be the investment thesis for us for the next 20 years. So with that, I'm happy to take some questions. And we already have our first hand up.\nRichard Repetto : So Peter, it looks like the market was probably expected a little bit less on the expense side. When you look at expenses, you sort of point to what a run rate father out the 4% to 5%. And I guess, what gives us the confidence, if you look at back now, we've been at 7%, I believe the last couple of years, is that right? So could you go over what keeps -- and how do we get the confidence that you can get to the 4% to 5% that you're looking at in the outer years?\nPeter Crawford : Sure. So tried to lay out a increase from '22 to '23. I mean the biggest single one was the integration-related spending. Now that's not a -- just to be clear, that's the surge staffing to handle those call volumes, a large portion of that will reverse and will go down in 2024. So that will be a helpful offset to our other expense growth. And then the software and hardware depreciation and amortization, that's -- a lot of that's on hardware that we put into place in '22. And so we're already having the full year impact of that. So I wouldn\u2019t expect another step up in that expense as we go into 2024. 2024 and '25 are also the years where we harness the expense synergies. And so that's going to be very, very helpful. Remember, we said that the vast majority of remaining expense synergies would not necessarily be harnessed until we get through the client conversions. With that last client conversion in 2024, that's the year we really unlock that remaining roughly 1/3 of the expense synergies. So that's also a driver of that 45% expense growth. Rich, it's always -- we always a balance when we think about our expenses. And we want to drive down that EOCA, I believe, the most important thing is to make sure we're there for our clients. We will always make that trade-off to make sure where they're there for our clients because we know as important as it is to manage expenses, staying true to our clients, doing right by our clients, that is even more important. And so we want to be thoughtful around how we manage expenses, drive that expense on client assets down over time. And we think this is a plan to get -- to continue to do that.\nBrennan Hawken : Almost like I should let Brennan go first after last time. So I wanted to talk about the slide, Peter, showing the trajectory to that 3% NIM. It's consistent with what you outlined at the last business update. At the same time, we have seen long end rates come in a fair amount. And I was hoping you could speak to what enables you to hold the line at that 3% given some of the pressures that we've seen at the long end.\nPeter Crawford : Well, it's really a function of, as I mentioned, I mean, there's not any unusual assumptions in there around sort of outsized margin balance growth it assumes continued growth and margin balances consistent with the growth in the market and continued growth in our lending solutions that we talked about -- but it really is the -- a more significant driver of that is the repricing, resetting the yields on the fixed investment portfolio at those prevailing higher prices. And where the market is at 3.75% or 4%, that pickup is still very significant as we continue to reinvest those maturing proceeds. That\u2019s the real advantage of -- that we have of having that sort of unlocked earnings power stored up that we'll be able to unleash as we reinvest that fixed investment portfolio.\nBrennan Hawken : Peter. So I actually have a longer-term strategic question, but a couple of just tactical questions just because you dropped a lot on this. The interest earning outlook -- the interesting asset outlook, does that contemplate the FHLB borrowing and does it include it? And are you still thinking that the mid-single-digit as a percentage of interest-earning assets is an upward bound for some of those alternative funding.\nPeter Crawford : So the interest earning asset assumption down 8% to 12% over the course of the year assumes that we've reduced those interest-earning assets significantly by the end of 2023. In terms of your second question around the mid-single digits, I guess it depends on how you define mid-single digit, I mean it might be mid, might be up or mid, somewhere in that range, whether it's -- but the most important point is it's a temporary funding source that we expect will be paid off as we see a resumption in sort of core deposit growth.\nBrennan Hawken : Okay. And then on the strategic side, sort of taking a step back, you -- about a dozen years ago, you transitioned to the bank as sort of one of the main pistons in the earnings engine for Schwab. And you've been through a couple of cycles. We now have what's called Cat term. When you look back and you think about that transition, number one, do you still feel good about it as far as the right decision to make for shareholders and for the company? And then how are you thinking about making some adjustments from here?\nPeter Crawford : Yes. Great question. Yes. I mean I'm very grateful that we launched the bank when we did to continue to grow revenue as we've grown assets -- continue to be successful as we've grown assets. It's a more efficient way to monetize our clients' uninvested cash balances. And that's what's allowed us thrive I missed an environment where equity commissions were going to where we saw a movement of client assets out of Mutual Fund 1 source into ETFs and index funds. And I think what's interesting about the bank, though, is while it started out a little bit more as a way to monetize our clients on invested cash. Its role has evolved. It's now a really important strategic capability for us. Because as Jonathan and Bernie and Neesha, Rick, Walt all talked about, we are competing against big banks and warehouses. And this lending, our ability to offer lending solutions -- very compelling lending solutions at a very low cost is really, really important, both defensively and offensively for us. So it absolutely allows us to compete against those firms, compete for clients, retain the clients that we have. Very, very important capability for us that is out.\nMichael Cyprys : Great. Mike Cyprys, Morgan Stanley. Just wanted to follow up on your point around sorting will abate likely in '23. I guess if we look at labor market remains very tight, some questions out there that the Fed may have to hike even more than what anyone expects today. So if that plays out -- if that other scenario plays out, and we're sitting here a year from now when rates are sorting abating in '23, it impact that down 8 to 12 on IAs.\nPeter Crawford : So we think that we're at a rate now of the Fed funds rate, short-term rates, where incremental rate moves increases don't have a material impact in terms of level of sorting or the client is going to move into a purchase money fund when personal funds are yielding 5.25%. They're probably going to move in personally [consuming] 4.75%. We're at a point now where, again, that determination, that decision is not a huge factor. So I wouldn't expect that to be a big impact. While at the same time, of course, higher rates will be good for us in terms of the floating rate assets that we have margin loans, the segregated cap. Should we take one just maybe from the web before we -- from the web now. We're okay.\nCraig Siegenthaler : Sure. Yes. We can take one staying kind of on the sorting cycle. This would be -- we've got a few questions with the most recent one on this topic would be from Craig Siegenthaler at Bank of America. Talk a little bit about how investor utilization, for example, in bull markets, they tend to rotate out of cash and become net buyers of equities, could that create some kind of synthetic additional leg of sorting or...\nPeter Crawford : Yes, I would say a couple of things. Our client behavior regarding their cash is much more determined by the -- in terms of the cash per account is much more influenced by a level of interest rates and is by what's happening with the equity markets. When clients -- what we tend to see the impact from the equity markets is typically equity markets -- if the equity markets drop dramatically, cash comes on to the balance sheet, but a big lag. And of course, an environment where I think that you're getting at is equity markets, we suddenly see a big rally in the equity markets. That clearly is a net positive for Schwab, right? If we see a dramatic rise in equity markets, all the asset-based fees, those go up, the measures of the client engagement tend to follow. So we tend to see more margin utilization, more trading more securities lending revenue, all of those, that is absolutely a net positive for Schwab on that. And I would -- any impact on client cash allocations tends to be very delayed and much more muted relative to the impact of interest rates.\nKyle Voigt : Kyle Voigt, KBW. Just given that you're above target -- your target on Tier leverage coming into 2023 and considering the additional expected decline in the balance sheet in 2023. I would expect the payout ratio could be meaningfully above the kind of 125% level that you laid out in the slide. Just wondering how we should think about the Tier 1 leverage ratio as we progress through this year, given that your deposits have been volatile over the past couple of years with the growth and then the decline. Is there an additional buffer above that 6.5 to 6.75 range that we should be thinking about you wanting to keep throughout this year? -- should we think that Tier leverage could actually move closer to the 6.75 as we progress?\nPeter Crawford : Yes. So we've set our buybacks into the opportunistic, not programmatic. But I would say -- and I think you're absolutely right. The payout ratio could be significantly above that 125% level. We wanted to make sure we gave ourselves a lot of a lot of leeway there. I'd expect that we will continue to buy back our stock, again, opportunistically and bring that leverage ratio down over the course of the year. In terms of maintaining, I don't see the need to necessarily maintain some buffer. We already that 6 50 to 6 75 is a buffer on top of the buffer. Now if we saw a dramatic change in the market that we anticipate a dramatic incline sheet, that might be a situation where we say, okay, let's slow this down. But if we're in a situation we're in right now, I think we'd be bringing that Tier 1 leverage ratio down from where it is today over time.\nDaniel Fannon : Peter, maybe one more in the scenario. Just directionally has to be from Dan Fannon at Jefferies. Could you elaborate a little bit more on some of the other we'll say, client-driven metrics that might be baked into the scenarios that you shared. So in terms of how should folks think about trading levels relative to recent periods, margin utilization, et cetera?\nPeter Crawford : Yes. So you can see all the -- I should have mentioned this, you can see all those assumptions in the appendix. And certainly, you're welcome to follow up with the IR team in terms of the specifics, given the answer of time, I won't go through kind of all those different assumptions. But they're there's so a pretty relatively conventional assumptions, not dissimilar from what we assume every year when we provide our scenarios.\nRichard Repetto : So Peter, I believe last quarter, at least versus our estimates, the BDA, there appear to be some sorting going on with BDA, and you commented about the unique arrangement with TD Bank. So I guess the question is -- we didn't expect the BDA to, at least from what I remember and talking to Ameritrade, it didn't really sort last cycle. So are you making the same assumptions on the BDA that your approach to seek equilibrium? What are you incorporate -- is it -- it's 6% of revenue, but is it meaningful enough to have an impact?\nPeter Crawford : Terminology that Jonathan referenced there, is the green clients, as we would expect, the green clients do tend to sort less than the blue clients. And that's smaller accounts, more trading-oriented. What's also different though is the green clients tend to be a little bit more responsive to the market. And so what we've actually been seeing is as the market has been declining a lot of Ameritrade clients are looking at as an opportunity to buy into the market. And so we've actually seen earlier not actually inflows even as the market has been declining, and that's been one of the drivers -- big drivers of those -- the decline in the BDA balances.\nBrennan Hawken: So following up on that, I think in your slide, there was the $100 million BDA breakage. Can you discuss some of the mechanics of that? So what does that do -- is that what you pay to basically break the ladder and then you can -- what sort of percentage of that BDA would move into float? And what are the underlying assumptions around the continued maybe -- are you assuming the balances keep declining kind of to the extent the rate was [asking].\nPeter Crawford : Yes. So the way to think about that breakage fee is essentially is like the market -- those are what we're essentially breaking as our fixed rate investments for lack of a better term. And so that breakage fee is roughly equivalent to the mark-to-market on those fixed rate investments. So from an NPV standpoint, it's neutral to positive for us from a net present value standpoint because we can take those proceeds and reinvest at higher yields. In terms of the BDA assumptions going forward, I think it's fair to assume that the BDA balances declined by roughly $10 billion a year until we get to the $50 billion floor, so we're 6 or 7 years away from that. There's a lot of sort of moving pieces within it and a lot of acronyms we can throw at you. But that, I think, if you're trying to model the business over the next 5, 6, 7 years, 10 years, I would assume that the BDA balances decline by roughly $10 billion a year until we get that $50 billion floor. I think we have time maybe for one more question.\nUnidentified Analyst: So Brennan actually asked the question. It seems like that was due or at least some certainly deserved. But does the IA guidance assume in the incremental BDA sweeps as well, Peter, as we think about the 8% to 12% decline that's being contemplated.\nPeter Crawford : So the 8% to 12% decline seems airy for all the actions that we're planning on taking in 2023. Yes. That's sort of everything. There's nothing we're holding out through us separately from that. But again, I want to emphasize that assumes a reduction in some of those temporary funding sources, the CDs, FHLB, et cetera, that we had of 2022, our expectation is majority of that is gone by the end of 2023.\nPeter Crawford : So I think we're just about out of time. I'm sure there's no shortage of questions. Certainly, the IR team is always available to answer any follow-up questions for hanging in there. We really appreciate you taking the time to certainly understand this company. Hopefully, what came through is my colleagues and I spoke, is a combination of excitement and about the opportunities we have to continue driving strong organic growth, continue unlocking revenue opportunities, continue doing better for our clients and continue driving greater efficiency. And then the confidence, trusting that our strategy has worked through good times and bad times, and our track record speak for itself. That's certainly what makes us all feel very excited. We look forward to engaging with you again at our April Business Update. Thank you again for those of you who have traveled here to Westlake, thank you for those on the web for joining us for the last 4-plus hours, and we look forward to talking to you soon. Cheers.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Crawford",
            "content": "Right. Excellent. Well, thank you very much the home stretch indeed. And thank you. It looks like most of you came back to hear my session. I feel honored and delighted and hopefully, I won't disappoint. Great to see so many familiar faces here and see the familiar backs of the laptops here in the room and here in Dallas. And I also want to thank all of you up there out in the web for joining us for this multi-hour webcast. I know we're all at this point, tired of doing a long webcast, but hopefully, we've made it worth your while and giving you a lot of good information about the company. So by now, you've had a chance to hear from my colleagues about the strong momentum we have in the market despite investor sentiment that has been decidedly negative about the progress we're making on the Ameritrade integration and our excitement about the considerable opportunities that the combination enables about our ambitious but achievable agenda to create and to continue building the premier wealth management platform for retail clients and for RIAs. And finally, about our confidence in sustaining this enviable level of organic growth we've been able to deliver. So in my time today, I'll recap yet another year of record financial performance in the face of a mixed environment that featured both headwinds and tailwinds. I'll also provide some more empirical data and some more information analysis around our clients' behavior with regarding to their cash and explain why we're confident that this behavior will abate during 2023. And we'll see at some point this year a resumption of deposit growth. And finally, I'll talk about our outlook for 2023, a year that Walt described in his comments as a transitional year. A transition for our economy as the Fed seems poised to pause this tightening cycle, a transition for our organization as we shift our focus beyond the integration to the considerable opportunities that this union creates and a transition for us as well from our financial performance. As we're poised to produce revenue growth that may be a little bit lower than what we've seen in the last couple of years, there's a [head] even, and this is really important, even if rates fall in the outer years as many expect. So let's talk about some of the factors that contributed to that record financial. So it's a year ago at this meeting, it was virtual, but we laid out our scenario for the year. And the scenario used -- assumed a number of pretty conventional assumptions. And most important of which was the expectation at the time by the market that we'd see 75 basis points of Fed increases over the course of 2022. Now of course, the year unfolded very, very differently than we, or pretty much anyone else expected, with the Fed actually hiking rates 75 basis points almost every meeting, but every other key measure falling over the course of the year. [Natural] performance reflected the resilience of our business model amidst these combination of headwinds and tailwinds. Revenue increased by 12% year-over-year, a function of our expanding net interest margin, which more than offset the decline in client cash balances and margin balances and trading and, of course, the impact of the declining equity markets. We contained our expense growth despite that revenue outperformance and continued high inflation and increases in some third-party pass-through fees, we contained our expense growth within the range that we communicated. And that combination produced a 50% adjusted pre-tax margin, our highest best year ever and 20% growth in adjusted earnings per share to $3.90. Turning our attention to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet reflected the reaction by our clients to the dramatic increase in rates. As they move some of their uninvested cash off our balance sheet into higher-yielding alternatives oftentimes with our active help and encouragement. Total balance sheet assets declined 17% for the year, driven by declines in both bank deposits as well as payables to brokerage clients. While we finished the year with roughly $17 billion of FHLB advances and other short-term borrowings. Now within interest-earning assets, we saw a 28% reduction in margin balances, a function of the more negative investor sentiment as well as higher rates. But we did see a 17% increase in bank loans owing to a lot of what my colleagues talked about. Despite the higher rates, we continue to have a remarkably strong pipeline of loans certainly relative to those pre-pandemic levels. Now our stockholders' equity declined function of declines in our available for sale mark-to-market unrealized declines in our available-for-sale portfolio. Of course, those don't impact our regulatory capital. So with that, despite that, our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio climbed 100 basis points to finish well above our operating objective of [6.50]% to [6.75]%. Now we've talked for years to do 2 things: to deliver strong financial performance top line growth, organic growth, and at the same time, deliver significant capital -- return significant capital to our stockholders. And I think 2022 demonstrated our ability to do all that, because even as we were producing that record financial performance, we increased our dividend. We bought back 47 million shares of stock, and we redeemed $1 billion by our outstanding preferred. That is growth plus -- we talked about growth plus capital return. 2022 was a great example of growth plus capital return. Now it's been just over a year since we closed the acquisition of Ameritrade. And my colleagues have talked about the strategic benefits of that acquisition, and also about the considerable revenue and expense synergy that it unlocks. And those are certainly the most important aspects of the deal. But the union of these 2 companies also creates a company with a more all-weather diversified business model. And I think it's helpful to see that to compare our performance in the fourth quarter this year to the first quarter we were a combined company with fourth quarter 2020. Now remember, that was a period of time when we had been enjoying an unprecedented level of trading activity, a function of the COVID and the introduction of a lot of newer investors into the category. So our financial performance in that fourth quarter was the best financial performance in our company's history. And since then, equity markets have fallen. We've seen trading activity has about a -- over a 30% increase in revenue. Over 40 -- 45% increase in adjusted earnings per share, we increased our pretax margin by roughly 600 basis points in just those last two years. So I mentioned in the CFO commentary last week that we've entered what we believe is the later innings of the client cash sorting cycle. I said not the -- It's not the Mariano Rivera innings. This is not necessarily the last inning, but the later innings of this cycle. And so we wanted to build off the commentary we provided at the fall business update to explain this and explain why we're confident this is the case. And while again, we'll see a resumption of the balance sheet -- or the deposit growth over the course of 2023. So our clients -- recall that our clients tend to keep a certain level of transactional cash in their accounts for liquidity purposes. And as their cash levels approach those level, the cash that we received from new accounts offset any lingering sorting activity that we see in the existing accounts. And this is a graph that explains how that looks. Now this is a particular wealth tier, a particular tier of clients who have, for example, between $1 million, let's say, $1 million and $2.5 million of total assets in their account. We've done this analysis across 30 different wealth tiers, across 5 different client segments and the pattern is exactly the same. And what you see and what these lines represent is different cohorts of clients within that well tier based off of how much cash they had at the beginning of the rising rate cycle. And so the upper one, of course, has more cash and lower one has less cash. And again, we've done this for multiple we've shown 2 here, but we've done this for multiple cohorts of clients based off of their cash levels. And what you see, of course, is that as interest rates increase, those cash balances for that entire cohort start declining, but they don't decline to zero. They declined, they sort of converge around this, we call here an equilibrium line or what we called previously that floor. And really importantly, the pace of that decline, the pace of that sorting roughly corresponds to the distance they are from their cash levels are from that equilibrium level. Now that may not be totally cash with clients whose cash balance are below that level at the outset of the rising rate cycle. And what we see there is their cash balances actually increase. And this is why we say you better to think of this more as an equilibrium versus a floor. The point is even clients who start up with low cash even as rates are increasing -- even as rates have increased by 400-plus basis points from last year. They're actually increasing the level of transactional cash level of cash on our balance sheet during that period of time. Again, we supports this idea that there is this equilibrium level of transactional cash that clients want to maintain. Now we've seen this -- we saw this pattern in the last rising rate cycle, and we've seen it in this rising rate cycle as it is holding true here. There's another example of another demonstration of the existence of that equilibrium level. And each of these lines represent a group of clients who place their foot during that month. And what you see is they place -- they start using purchase money funds, and they basically reduce their cash level to a certain equilibrium level. And then they're content with that. It doesn't go to zero. You stay at that level. And regardless of when they start that process, they all end basically in the same place. Then there is this level of transactional cash within the different accounts. And of course, it varies based on how much assets they have in their account. But each of those have a pretty consistent level of equilibrium transaction cash they want to have on their account. So what we've seen is that the sorting activity that we have seen thus far follows almost identically cycle. It's following the same behavior, the same behavior that we saw from the 2015 through 2019 cycle. And we continue to believe that the magnitude of the sorting activity for existing clients will be not that much different from what we saw in the previous cycle. And therefore, at some point, during 2023, that sorting activity will continue to slow, and it will be offset by organic cash that comes in via new accounts, and we'll see a return of deposit growth. So our success in 2022 puts us in a great position as we head into 2023. But even so, there are, as always, a number of -- which we have various degrees of control. So now for the long waited much anticipated scenario. There's clearly a debate in the market about what's going to happen with Fed policy and frankly, even a debate between what the market expects and what the Fed expects. And so rather than try to take a stand on that debate, we put together first one roughly follows the forward curve, market expectations for 2 rate increases at the beginning of the year and then a rate cut at the end of the year. And the second dot plus, so three Fed hikes over the course of the beginning of the year held constant throughout the year. And then those different scenarios share a handful of common assumptions. One is that deposit betas that continue to be below. Second is end of period -- or December average interest-earning assets down between 8% and 12% from the end of 2022 with a portion of that decline being our expected reduction in some of those temporary funding sources by December. Third is we're calling BDA breakage fees. This is a breakage fee that we incur. It [counts] as a contra revenue from removing the third-party fixed rate balances from the BDA. Now we pay a breakage fee as we do that. These are fixed rate balances. We have the opportunity to reinvest those now prevailing higher yields or use that to offset higher cost funding. And then a capital payout ratio a well in excess of 100% for the year. And you can see for those two scenarios in the lower scenario, we'd expect to produce revenue growth in the 5% to 7% range. On the upper scenario 7% to 9%. Both scenarios we'd anticipate a change, which I'll talk about more in a moment with an adjusted pre-tax margin of 48%, 49% or potentially a low, but better than that. So let me talk about the different components that go into these -- we'll start on the revenue side with our net interest margin. Assuming that rates follow the forward curve, and actually, when we see -- we potentially see a rate declines in the outer years, we would see our net interest margin climbing into the low 2 6s by the fourth quarter of 2023 on a path to exceed 3% by the end of 2025. If interest rates are falling, how could that be? And the reason for that is because our fixed investment portfolio -- fixed investment securities portfolio, much of that was purchased during the period in 2020, 2021, when -- you see on the right here, the average yield on those securities. And so as those securities pay down, mature, et cetera, we have the opportunity to reinvest those proceeds in the market. So rates could follow. I mean these yields are more than 300 basis points lower than they are today if we were to replace those securities. So rates could still fall and we still have a nice opportunity to pick up yield as that investment -- fixed investment portfolio turns over in the outer years. Now that 7% to 8% adjusted expense growth is certainly a little bit higher than our long-term average that we've allowed in our -- over our history, but it puts us in a really good position to limit expense growth in '24 and '25 to no more than 5% per year as we harness the remaining expense synergies from the Ameritrade integration. Schwab DNA. It's one of the hallmarks of what you can count on for Schwab for much of our history. We are on a multi-decade journey to drive our expense on client assets ever lower. We see it as a really important competitive advantage when we don't want to -- we certainly don't want to take it for granted. The #1 way you can drive EOCA, expense on client assets, lower is to grow. And the way to grow is to do right by clients. And so there's always a balance between managing expenses in the near term while making appropriate investments in our clients and our business to support long-term growth. I think our track record speaks our ability to find that balance, our ability to grow, to drive down EOCA over time and to deliver operating leverage through the cycle so does the expense growth. So we start with our GAAP spending last year of $11.4 billion. And we deduct about $1 billion of integration expense and that gets us to our adjusted expense number. And we layer on top of that what we call fundamental operating expense. This is our sort of normal routine expenses to support our growing client base to handle moderating but still elevated levels of inflation and to advance the strategic agenda that my colleagues talked about. Now this year, we have -- on top of that, we have other institutions have talked about a 2 basis point increase in the FDIC premium. We expect that to add about 0.5 point to 1 percentage point to our growth rate. And then this next item is one I talked about last year, and I don't expect I'll be talking about it next year, but these are basically integration-related spending that's still included within our adjusted expenses. There's really three components to that. One is software that we're developing for the integration. Joe talked about that, all the work for example we're doing on to bring thinker slim over to sit on top of the Schwab platform. The software we're doing to ensure a smooth client experience. Second component is hardware, which we -- most of which we added last year to support the combined client base at conversion to support growth in the years ahead. And we're admittedly a bit conservative in terms of the capacity we added, but this will allow us to decommission a lot of the legacy Ameritrade hardware. And then the third is something that Jonathan talked about, which is temporary surge staffing to handle what we expect to be a high volume of calls around the conversion events. And so you put all those together, and that adds about 2 to 2.5 percentage points of growth. Benefit of the synergies -- most of these are the synergies that we -- or actions we took in 2022, and we got the full year benefit of them in 2023. And that's how you get to this number, our expectations for the year. So before I close, we're certainly gratified by the financial performance of the company over the last couple of years. I think those of you who have followed this company for a long period of time, and I think that includes pretty much everyone in this room, know that we don't manage the company quarter-to-quarter. We have a long-term orientation, which is borne of our confidence that our Through Clients' Eyes strategy has delivered and should continue to deliver for clients and stockholders over a long period of time. And so before we close, I wanted to zoom up from the conversation around 2022 and 2023, and look at how that financial formula we've talked about in the past has performed at last -- and it starts, of course, with our Through Clients' Eyes strategy, our competitive positioning, generating strong, consistent organic growth, which when you combine that with the low double-digit asset growth. Through our business model, the combined banking, brokerage and asset management, we're able to assure in some parts of our business with win-win monetization opportunities elsewhere, converting that level of asset growth an equivalent level of revenue growth. By managing our expenses to grow at a pace slower than the growth in revenue, we're able to expand margins and generate even faster growth in earnings. And then by being thoughtful around how we manage our capital. We're able to generate even stronger growth in our earnings per share. How has that done over the last 20 years? Certainly quite well. So that financial formula has absolutely delivered for clients and of course, delivery for stockholders for the last 20 years. It starts, of course, with our ability to grow assets. And both Walt and Rick talked about the strong organic growth and how we've been able to sustain that organic growth even as we become a bigger firm. That is the key ingredient here. It's that Through Clients' Eyes strategy disrupting they do that. We focus on our clients. They reward us with more of their business, and they also refer their friends to us. Over time, we've overcoming the decline of equity -- long march of equity commission to zero and the shift from a lot of client assets from mutual funds into ETFs trading and asset management fees, all without taking any material credit risk. Now net interest revenue is, of course, the product of net interest margin and our interest-earning assets. And as we've seen in the last 9 months, those can sometimes move in different ways. It can be cyclical, but Sickle cyclical will go in opposite directions. But the point is because of that, we're able to grow together. By thoughtfully managing our expenses, we've been able to increase our margins over time. And then by being equally thoughtful in terms of how we manage our -- very efficient in how we manage our capital. We've been able to reward our stockholders by increasing our dividend and by opportunistically buying back our stock with a payout ratio over the last 5 years. Let me just close with a couple of thoughts. Almost $430 billion in net new assets, a 12% increase in revenue, 20% -- 50% adjusted pre-tax margin. We're certainly proud of the financial performance of the company, especially in light of what has been a challenging environment for many companies. I'd say we're even more proud about how we've been there for our clients during this tough period of time. Somebody asked me the other day recently kind of what's the investment thesis for Schwab today? And I said the investment thesis for Schwab today is the same as it's been for much of our history. It's not just a bet on higher interest rates or a snapback in the equity markets. Well, certainly, both of those would be beneficial to our business. Rather, it's the confidence in a company whose strategy and who is operating in financial performance -- function of our strategy were no trade-offs positioning of the millions, now tens of millions of client promoters we have among our client base and our leading position in the two fastest-growing segments of Wealth Management, the RIA channel and the retail brokerage channel. It's a company that has been consistently able to turn that asset growth in resilient business model, a company that doesn't take credit risk. A company that is thoughtful about how it manages expenses. That does always mean growing expenses at the lowest rate in the industry necessarily. It means striking that careful balance between delivering in the near term and making appropriate investments that will drive long-term growth, long-term success for our clients and for our business. And a company that recognizes that it's not our capital, it's our stockholders' capital, and always being very, very mindful and being very, very efficient. That's been the investment thesis for much of our history. And I think that -- I'm very confident that will be the investment thesis for us for the next 20 years. So with that, I'm happy to take some questions. And we already have our first hand up. Sure. So tried to lay out a increase from '22 to '23. I mean the biggest single one was the integration-related spending. Now that's not a -- just to be clear, that's the surge staffing to handle those call volumes, a large portion of that will reverse and will go down in 2024. So that will be a helpful offset to our other expense growth. And then the software and hardware depreciation and amortization, that's -- a lot of that's on hardware that we put into place in '22. And so we're already having the full year impact of that. So I wouldn't expect another step up in that expense as we go into 2024. 2024 and '25 are also the years where we harness the expense synergies. And so that's going to be very, very helpful. Remember, we said that the vast majority of remaining expense synergies would not necessarily be harnessed until we get through the client conversions. With that last client conversion in 2024, that's the year we really unlock that remaining roughly 1/3 of the expense synergies. So that's also a driver of that 45% expense growth. Rich, it's always -- we always a balance when we think about our expenses. And we want to drive down that EOCA, I believe, the most important thing is to make sure we're there for our clients. We will always make that trade-off to make sure where they're there for our clients because we know as important as it is to manage expenses, staying true to our clients, doing right by our clients, that is even more important. And so we want to be thoughtful around how we manage expenses, drive that expense on client assets down over time. And we think this is a plan to get -- to continue to do that. Well, it's really a function of, as I mentioned, I mean, there's not any unusual assumptions in there around sort of outsized margin balance growth it assumes continued growth and margin balances consistent with the growth in the market and continued growth in our lending solutions that we talked about -- but it really is the -- a more significant driver of that is the repricing, resetting the yields on the fixed investment portfolio at those prevailing higher prices. And where the market is at 3.75% or 4%, that pickup is still very significant as we continue to reinvest those maturing proceeds. That's the real advantage of -- that we have of having that sort of unlocked earnings power stored up that we'll be able to unleash as we reinvest that fixed investment portfolio. So the interest earning asset assumption down 8% to 12% over the course of the year assumes that we've reduced those interest-earning assets significantly by the end of 2023. In terms of your second question around the mid-single digits, I guess it depends on how you define mid-single digit, I mean it might be mid, might be up or mid, somewhere in that range, whether it's -- but the most important point is it's a temporary funding source that we expect will be paid off as we see a resumption in sort of core deposit growth. Yes. Great question. Yes. I mean I'm very grateful that we launched the bank when we did to continue to grow revenue as we've grown assets -- continue to be successful as we've grown assets. It's a more efficient way to monetize our clients' uninvested cash balances. And that's what's allowed us thrive I missed an environment where equity commissions were going to where we saw a movement of client assets out of Mutual Fund 1 source into ETFs and index funds. And I think what's interesting about the bank, though, is while it started out a little bit more as a way to monetize our clients on invested cash. Its role has evolved. It's now a really important strategic capability for us. Because as Jonathan and Bernie and Neesha, Rick, Walt all talked about, we are competing against big banks and warehouses. And this lending, our ability to offer lending solutions -- very compelling lending solutions at a very low cost is really, really important, both defensively and offensively for us. So it absolutely allows us to compete against those firms, compete for clients, retain the clients that we have. Very, very important capability for us that is out. So we think that we're at a rate now of the Fed funds rate, short-term rates, where incremental rate moves increases don't have a material impact in terms of level of sorting or the client is going to move into a purchase money fund when personal funds are yielding 5.25%. They're probably going to move in personally [consuming] 4.75%. We're at a point now where, again, that determination, that decision is not a huge factor. So I wouldn't expect that to be a big impact. While at the same time, of course, higher rates will be good for us in terms of the floating rate assets that we have margin loans, the segregated cap. Should we take one just maybe from the web before we -- from the web now. We're okay. Yes, I would say a couple of things. Our client behavior regarding their cash is much more determined by the -- in terms of the cash per account is much more influenced by a level of interest rates and is by what's happening with the equity markets. When clients -- what we tend to see the impact from the equity markets is typically equity markets -- if the equity markets drop dramatically, cash comes on to the balance sheet, but a big lag. And of course, an environment where I think that you're getting at is equity markets, we suddenly see a big rally in the equity markets. That clearly is a net positive for Schwab, right? If we see a dramatic rise in equity markets, all the asset-based fees, those go up, the measures of the client engagement tend to follow. So we tend to see more margin utilization, more trading more securities lending revenue, all of those, that is absolutely a net positive for Schwab on that. And I would -- any impact on client cash allocations tends to be very delayed and much more muted relative to the impact of interest rates. Yes. So we've set our buybacks into the opportunistic, not programmatic. But I would say -- and I think you're absolutely right. The payout ratio could be significantly above that 125% level. We wanted to make sure we gave ourselves a lot of a lot of leeway there. I'd expect that we will continue to buy back our stock, again, opportunistically and bring that leverage ratio down over the course of the year. In terms of maintaining, I don't see the need to necessarily maintain some buffer. We already that 6 50 to 6 75 is a buffer on top of the buffer. Now if we saw a dramatic change in the market that we anticipate a dramatic incline sheet, that might be a situation where we say, okay, let's slow this down. But if we're in a situation we're in right now, I think we'd be bringing that Tier 1 leverage ratio down from where it is today over time. Yes. So you can see all the -- I should have mentioned this, you can see all those assumptions in the appendix. And certainly, you're welcome to follow up with the IR team in terms of the specifics, given the answer of time, I won't go through kind of all those different assumptions. But they're there's so a pretty relatively conventional assumptions, not dissimilar from what we assume every year when we provide our scenarios. Terminology that Jonathan referenced there, is the green clients, as we would expect, the green clients do tend to sort less than the blue clients. And that's smaller accounts, more trading-oriented. What's also different though is the green clients tend to be a little bit more responsive to the market. And so what we've actually been seeing is as the market has been declining a lot of Ameritrade clients are looking at as an opportunity to buy into the market. And so we've actually seen earlier not actually inflows even as the market has been declining, and that's been one of the drivers -- big drivers of those -- the decline in the BDA balances. Yes. So the way to think about that breakage fee is essentially is like the market -- those are what we're essentially breaking as our fixed rate investments for lack of a better term. And so that breakage fee is roughly equivalent to the mark-to-market on those fixed rate investments. So from an NPV standpoint, it's neutral to positive for us from a net present value standpoint because we can take those proceeds and reinvest at higher yields. In terms of the BDA assumptions going forward, I think it's fair to assume that the BDA balances declined by roughly $10 billion a year until we get to the $50 billion floor, so we're 6 or 7 years away from that. There's a lot of sort of moving pieces within it and a lot of acronyms we can throw at you. But that, I think, if you're trying to model the business over the next 5, 6, 7 years, 10 years, I would assume that the BDA balances decline by roughly $10 billion a year until we get that $50 billion floor. I think we have time maybe for one more question. So the 8% to 12% decline seems airy for all the actions that we're planning on taking in 2023. Yes. That's sort of everything. There's nothing we're holding out through us separately from that. But again, I want to emphasize that assumes a reduction in some of those temporary funding sources, the CDs, FHLB, et cetera, that we had of 2022, our expectation is majority of that is gone by the end of 2023. So I think we're just about out of time. I'm sure there's no shortage of questions. Certainly, the IR team is always available to answer any follow-up questions for hanging in there. We really appreciate you taking the time to certainly understand this company. Hopefully, what came through is my colleagues and I spoke, is a combination of excitement and about the opportunities we have to continue driving strong organic growth, continue unlocking revenue opportunities, continue doing better for our clients and continue driving greater efficiency. And then the confidence, trusting that our strategy has worked through good times and bad times, and our track record speak for itself. That's certainly what makes us all feel very excited. We look forward to engaging with you again at our April Business Update. Thank you again for those of you who have traveled here to Westlake, thank you for those on the web for joining us for the last 4-plus hours, and we look forward to talking to you soon. Cheers."

            "name": "Joseph Martinetto",
            "content": "Thanks, Rick. Good morning, everybody. So I was flipping through my e-mails this morning, and I saw one with the intriguing title of hot topics in accounting this week. And I've grown inwardly and I pushed the delete button. And I reflected for a minute that this presentation may sound a little bit like that e-mail to many of you, Joe is going to go talk about technology infrastructure. So I really want to reframe it a little bit. My two objectives today, one is to maybe get you a little bit excited about the opportunities in front of us to continue to drive scale and efficiency into the business for the long run while continuing to deliver great client experiences. So I think that's maybe a little bit more exciting. The second part is to give you an update on where we stand on the integration. And so if you still feel a need to grow and I'd ask please wait until after the prepared remarks, and then we'll take people's temperature then. So let's jump in on where we are on the integration. So we are into year 3 of work on integrating the firms at this point. And we've been doing a substantial body of work in the background to prepare for the client conversion, which is upcoming. We have done tremendous amount of work scaling the infrastructure on the Schwab Blue platform to allow us to bring over all of the accounts and positions and clients onto that platform. We've also been doing a bunch of testing of all the work that we've done. Walt made reference to the quality of the outcome that we're starting to get out of the testing at this point. We've got very high success rates, which gives us a lot of confidence that when we actually start to migrate the clients that we're going to be able to do this as effectively as possible. We have been doing work on the client side on a couple of different dimensions. So a piece of it is we've been bringing over different products and services onto the Schwab platform. So those of you that are Schwab clients may have noticed changes in the trading platform over the course of the last several months as we've been bringing on some of the best-of-breed capabilities that were on that Ameritrade platform that weren't on the Schwab platform. So when we do bring the clients over, they're going to get an experience that's pretty similar to what they had prior to the conversion. We've also been doing work to ensure that when the clients come over that they have a great experience in the process of that transition, and we'll spend a little bit more time talking about what that's going to look like on subsequent slides. But the goal here is to try to make it as easy as possible for those clients to get themselves set up on the Schwab platform so that we can, to the extent possible, pull some of those questions forward before conversion and get them addressed before the clients come over, so that when they actually are converted that they don't then find themselves in sort of a cold experience, forced to call in, and experience probably some challenging service experiences as we see a spike in activity on some of those most critical conversion dates. Rick made reference to the fact that we've been doing some work to start to make some of the products and services available to the client set. I think we're incredibly excited about the opportunity in front of us to continue to do more of that. Frankly, some of what we've done has been basically meeting demand, but we've done it in a way that probably is far more manual than what we're going to be able to deliver once we get the clients on to the Schwab Blue platform. And the last thing, Walt made reference to the fact that despite all of our best efforts, we know that there are going to be some glitches that are going to happen in the process of moving the clients over. So we've invested significantly in building out enhanced client experience or enhanced service experiences and training our people to be able to meet the needs of those clients as they do come over and also bringing on some third-party services to help us make sure that we've got some ramped up capabilities that we'll be able to meet some of the most basic client service requests and doing it in a way that's cost efficient for the long run so that these are essentially kind of meeting spike needs in terms of call volumes but not embedding them into the long-term cost structure of the company. So we are on the verge of actually starting to move clients over. The first tranche is scheduled to come over on President's Day weekend in February, a couple of weeks from now. So what we have done here is broken the clients up into 5 different transition groups. So if I use the phrase like TG 1, TG 2, excuse me, it's just kind of embedded in the way I'm thinking about it at this point. We have, in total, somewhere between 18 million and 20 million accounts that we're going to be moving over, over the course of this entire integration. And the number moves around a little bit because clients are still opening new accounts. We're still doing work to clean up accounts on the platform. So -- but still between 18 million, 20 million, give you a sense of the scale of what we are achieving here. We have a relatively small group that we're moving in February. It's about 0.5 million accounts. It's intended to be more of a test group. So it's a relatively smaller group of people who are maybe not quite the most active users of the platforms, but it's an opportunity for us to move the assets, bring them onto the platform, test the service experience, make sure all the technology is working the way we expect before we engage in some of the larger transition groups later in the year. We have a big group scheduled for the Memorial Day weekend, which is predominantly the non-advised retail client group. We've got another group scheduled for Labor Day, which is the advised client group plus the advisors. And then we have another tranche scheduled for November, which is the bulk of the traders coming over the tossed users. We have one more group of traders, those most active people that use things like futures and ForEx, that we have moved into a small tranche in the first half of 2024, and that will be the last group of clients that we'll move. We've -- I guess, it's been a while since we actually spoke in person. The war in Ukraine impacted some of the resources that we're working on some of the conversion as a result of having brought some of that. And with the TD Ameritrade acquisition, that group is no longer available to us. And as a result, we've had to do some quick shuffling to identify resources and replan some of the transition. But we're still on track to have the vast majority of clients moved over by the end of this year with a small group into next year. Because of the way we've scheduled it in that small group, we don't believe that it's going to have an impact on our ability to recognize synergies from a timing or a total dollar perspective, and I'll summarize that here in the next page as well. But we do believe that we're ready. We have done everything necessary to -- on the testing side to make sure that we are as prepared as possible. We have started client notifications and have now sent out over 10 million communications with a lot more to come this year. As people move into their time schedule, as we get closer to their transition group, they'll get a series of communications that will prepare them for what's coming and what it is we need them to do. We have built out capabilities like a Welcome Center to let people come in and get a sense of what's available on the Schwab platform. We've also built a client conversion hub. So the purpose of the client conversion hub is to get the clients to engage with Schwab and come in and set up their credentials in advance of that transition. So we get them to come in, establish their user name and their passwords. So that's all set up before they actually get to the conversion window so that we don't have a bunch of people calling in on day one saying, how do I access my account. The upside for them for doing that is they will get what we call a future view. So they will get a chance to then look at the entirety of their household as we have mapped it inside of Schwab. The TD Ameritrade platform was a very account-based platform. So it was one log-in per account. At Schwab, we're more of a household base. So we will pull all of your accounts together into a household view. Once the clients establish that credential, they get a chance to come in, see what that household view looks like. And to the extent that they have other accounts that they want to identify and get linked to their household, they'll have an opportunity to do that as well prior to conversion. So we've done a lot of good work to try to take as much friction out of this as soon as possible to ease that transition process for the clients. On the dollar side, we're still on track to achieve the expense synergies that we have communicated, and we have gotten about 2/3 of those costs out of the system already. We have plans in place to be able to recognize the remainder of those by basically end of 2024. The savings that we'll see this year will probably be relatively modest. There's a small amount, I guess, a full year impact of some savings that we got last year. There's some smaller impacts as we bring the clients over on to the Schwab platforms. There are some places where we're more efficient on the operating side. So we'll start to see that as we migrate clients over the course of this year. But the bulk of the remaining savings are really going to come from decommissioning the duplicated platforms, and that can't happen until we get all the clients over, and there's a body of work to happen in 2024 to achieve that. But that's all programmed into our plans now for the remainder of this year and into next year. On the revenue side, we feel equally as good about the long-term projections. I'd say from a macro perspective, we have actually benefited from account acquisition and asset acquisition that's been better than anything that we had in the original business case for the transaction. Here in the near term, we may have been feeling a little bit more pressure around interest rates and what it's doing to some of the balances is the biggest driver of the revenue synergies over the long run is tied to the BDA transition. But when we look at it over a long period of time, and we have a number of years to run still on that BDA, we still feel good about where we are in terms of being able to recognize the totality of the revenue synergies that we talked about. And I would highlight that while we have started to do some basic work around things like offering banking products and services and we've done a few other things to make things like managed investing available, but it's still a pretty clunky process. Even with that clunky process, we've had really good feedback from the clients. I think Rick dimensionalized some of the opportunities that we think might be out there for us. Some of those numbers were not included in these revenue synergy numbers. So if anything, I would say that we probably have some upside out there related to some of those opportunities that we haven't put into the synergies. Switching over to some of the -- rest of the technology stack. We haven't been sitting on our hands while we've been working on integration. We have been continuing to do a lot of work in the background on some of the things that we have talked about over a number of years. We have had to restructure some of this work as a result of doing the integration. And while -- you can see that there's really 3 or 4 things here that we've talked about historically as being sort of independent programs. This has almost become a singular body of work that was necessary to accomplish to be able to affect the transition of all the clients and to build the scale that was necessary to deliver that. You can see on application modernization, which is really the move to pull a lot of the capabilities off of that old monolithic mainframe system and put it on to a distributed environment where we could scale it more efficiently. We're about 3/4 of the way through that body of work with the remainder of it expected to deliver over the course of the first half of this year. So that program is wrapping up basically on time and pretty close to on spend levels in terms of what we expected. We continue to see real benefits there in terms of some of the choices we've made. Really what we've done with the new environment that we've built is created a set of technology that's capable of being cloud-hosted. And we've, in essence, put it on a private cloud inside of our own data centers. So I'd say we have been a little bit interrupted in terms of some of our thinking around cloud migration. Because of the integration, we've been more focused on making sure that the platform is scaled and ready to accept the additional volumes. But there's still an opportunity out there to continue to migrate additional capabilities to the cloud. Even with that, we've identified a number of workloads that we have already been in process of moving, and I'd say they really fall into two main categories. So one of them is things like account log-in where you get big spikes in activity at points in time over the day, where it's pretty inefficient for us to build enough technology to deal with that volume that comes in over 3 minutes at market open, and you got to carry that capacity for the remainder of the day. Those kinds of workloads scale really efficiently in the cloud. And so we're prioritizing work like that as we think about some of our first moves to the cloud. I'd say the other part is things where capabilities are developing in the cloud that are becoming increasingly difficult to acquire and run on-premise. A lot of the analytical tools and the data tools that are now available at a lot of the cloud providers are really just superior to what we're able to build and deliver in our own platform. So a lot of the work we've been doing is establishing our client information and other databases out on the cloud and data warehouses to allow us to take advantage of those kinds of analytical capabilities going forward. So work has continued to progress on the things that are maybe most important in terms of cloud impact, but there's a lot of work left that we're going to be able to continue to think about. Scale and resiliency. So that movement to a private cloud structure has allowed us to build out a much more -- it looks a lot like the way modern cloud is hosted internally. So we've gone to this own region approach. So we've got multiple regions where we're running multiple zones inside of each region. That has given us not only the capability to scale effectively, but it also has given us the capability to manage the way we adapt when we see system challenges. So one of the things that's mentioned up here is legacy retirement. One of the things that we have done for years when we have system problems, we used the code base called [host fallback] which was a completely separate mainframe-based application, which had a really limited set of capabilities on it. So when we had to go into host fallback, we were limiting what our clients could do. They could trade and see balances with things like money movement, and a lot of the more advanced asset management capabilities we've built over the years really weren't enabled in host fallback. And so today, with what we've built in terms of the way the infrastructure runs, we're going to fall over from a zone within a region and then across the regions a lot more elegantly than what we used to have to implement with host fallback. And as a result of that, the clients should notice a lot less when we have system problems and have basically access to all the capabilities when we're going through that transition process. So it allows us to retire that block of host fallback code, as an example of some of the kinds of things that are happening in the background as we continue to make progress on modernizing some of the core infrastructure. So as we look forward, we are not done with some of the opportunities. You might be surprised to see that the #1 opportunity we highlighted here is Ameritrade integration. But when you think about what we've done with integration so far, we really gave ourselves a set of constraints that were driven by how much we were going to spend to get the integration done, the time frame that we needed to execute that conversion in. Now, obviously as we're in the timeframe we're willing to get it done. And so as a result, we had to opt on the amount of synergies we were looking to achieve. When you put all those things together, we made decisions that we thought were smart decisions as we were working our way through the integration approach. But that optimization frame meant that there was a series of things that we didn't tackle that give us future opportunities to continue to drive more efficiency as we look to some of the things that are still sitting out there. Public cloud migration, number two. There's still tremendous opportunity for us to look to move more workloads into the cloud. We're running a much larger and more complicated on-premise data center structure than we would like to run for the long run. The cloud really becomes the solution for how we get some of that workload off of the on-premise structures and lets us start to rationalize some of that over time. Efficiency and automation and the operations component. So some of that is very similar to the comments I made on Ameritrade integration. We made choices as we were thinking about how we were bringing these workloads together to try to make sure that we were going to achieve the synergy targets that we had committed to. But now with the volumes that we're at as we start to bring this work together, there's a lot of workloads that we can go through and continue to bring additional automation to. It's just a matter of now taking the resources that have been working on integration and starting to migrate them toward working on that further automation. And then finally, broker-dealer modernization. So those of you that have followed along for enough years might remember that broker-dealer modernization was actually a component originally of what we were trying to do with application modernization. And we pulled it out of that body of work as we migrated more towards some of the integration efforts. So the core here is to take that old core mainframe application books and record system of the broker-dealer and migrate it to a modern -- a more modern platform solution, probably a SaaS-based solution, as we look out into the marketplace and see what's available today. That not only drives additional expense benefits, but it also gives us an opportunity to take advantage of some capabilities that we don't have inside of the Schwab platform today. So things like multicurrency capabilities or multi-firm capabilities that we just don't have, given us an opportunity to think about where we might go with products and services in a way that it's not a to us on the platform that we have today. So it's a cost save, but it's also an opportunity for us to continue to build additional products and services to deliver to our clients. So there's a great body of work here that we're starting to try to figure out exactly how we're going to tackle it and sequence it, but we see a number of years of continued efficiency here that we're going to be able to deliver long beyond just the core integration work. So with that, I see hands coming up. We're opening the Q&A. Let's go ahead and get started. Sure. So I think we got to be a little careful here. So cloud doesn't come for free. There is investment that has to be made to be able to do the migration to the cloud. And we are not talking about moving everything that we do in terms of technology workloads on to the cloud. So that is not the goal. We are looking to take the things that make the most sense to run on the cloud and move them there. But we expect that we're going to be running on-site data centers for the foreseeable future. There's a certain amount of workload that's going to make sense for us to continue to manage on our own. So it's definitely an opportunity to use to continue to bend that cost curve. I think some of the bigger savings will actually come more on the physical side of data centers and data center infrastructure. Because of what we've done with the integration, we're running quite a number of data centers now, including some are owned and some are leased. But we've had to take on additional space just to be able to house all the hardware, get enough power and enough cooling to run everything that we see coming out of post-integration. And so rationalizing some of that workload will allow us to rationalize some of that footprint and continue to bend that cost curve. What I think probably important to think about is, like I talked about some of the integration work as being a single body of work. I think some of this optimization work is also going to be taken in the same kind of frame. On any given system, it may feel like a step-function change. But for a company as big as ours and given everything we spend in technology, it's probably not going to feel like a step-function reduction, it's going to feel more like a portfolio of work that's going to allow us to continue to drive some incremental scale consistently over time. So I think bending the cost curve is probably the right way to think about it. It will allow us to slow that pace of growth as we absorb new volumes and continue to drive efficiency into the processing that we're doing. Peter is going to have more to say about what the long-term prospects are for expenses as we look out a number of years. And so I think it's all kind of baked into his numbers. And so I'll defer the more specific answer to his presentation, if that's okay. Yes. So starting with attrition. The business case embedded a pretty modest 2% kind of number. So we are not expecting a material amount of attrition. We're going to measure it as best we can through the process. The risk probably comes at the time of conversion that as those clients get those notifications, that is probably the point where if we're going to see attrition, it's probably going to be as we're moving those specific books of business. We're doing everything possible to make sure that we're communicating with those clients, following up with those clients, giving them a great experience, trying to make it easy. Right now, I would say we are way ahead of the game in terms of client acquisition versus any attrition numbers that we embedded in the model, but we are probably going into the window where if we're going to see attrition present. As they are business folks, maybe you want to ask them is if they get up on stage to talk about what they're doing and how they're seeing it. But for right now, I think we're feeling pretty good about the attrition number based on the feedback we've been getting. From the process side, I'd say this is maybe a little bit different of an acquisition than something, I'll drop here, a little more like the USAA, where -- that was we bought a book of business. It happened over a weekend. We couldn't do anything with those clients prior. We converted their accounts, their assets. We opened for business. We had them set up their credentials on day one. That was a rockier kind of experience because of the nature of that transaction and the limitations on our ability to work with those clients in advance. Here, we own both broker-dealers. So we can essentially subsume those accounts. We already have the clients. We have the client account agreements in place. We can transfer those across the organization without having to novate new paper, right? They're not going to be new account forms. There's not going to be new sign-ups. There's not going to be -- it's not paper-based, right? We essentially have taken care of all of that in the process of reviewing the account agreements already. We've been doing a number of things in the background to try to pull work forward to make this easier on us and easier on the clients. We have actually gone through a process now where we have created every TD Ameritrade account and formed all of the households. So we are now running all of that infrastructure on the Schwab Blue platform. So all of that is set up and ready to go. The accounts are ready to receive the assets over the course of the transition weekend. And the clients, as I said earlier, are going to get that notification window and the opportunity to start to interact with that process much earlier and, we hope, much more seamlessly. We do know that there would be some clients that won't do that in advance and will, therefore, need to either go through that process after conversion or will call us and say, \"Gee, I tried to log on and I can't get on. What do I have to do?\" And we'll have to help them get their credentials established. And we have, as we said, trained 11,000 Schwab employees. We have brought on a substantial block of third-party resources to help us deal with that. We have done everything that we can foresee. Again, I can't say it's going to be completely seamless, but it should be as well engineered as we can possibly make it. We have cleaned up over 3 million client records just trying to make sure that when people come across, their accounts won't be restricted because we'll have to put a know-your-client block on it because we don't have all the information. We've gone through, we've contacted the clients, we've got the information, we've cleaned that stuff up. We are down to really small numbers, measured in like thousands of accounts that we think right now we still might have some kind of lock on. But when you think about 18 million to 20 million accounts moving and maybe something less than 10,000 accounts to where we're still working to refine client data, and we still have the majority of the year to work on some of that. Like I said, we have done everything possible to try to make sure this goes as smoothly as it possibly can. Yes. So I mean you saw one of the primary cloud initiatives was to move our databases over onto cloud database. Some of that was to be able to take advantage of some of the advanced analytic capabilities that are available in those environments that are hard to stand up independently. So I think we've been doing the work to prepare ourselves to take advantage of those more advanced analytics. I'm a fan of AI, but I don't know that it's necessarily necessary. There's a lot of other advanced analytics that you can drive before you even get to AI that will let you be able to deliver superior client experiences. We've got some instances where we're already doing some of that work. We've got capabilities that we've built over the years like Next Best Conversation, so our service professionals based on the cues that they're seeing, get a series of prompts that are delivered to them to try to make sure that they're navigating through the right things that the clients might have an interest in. We have things like the Schwab intelligent assistance, an online chat bot that's being driven by a lot of those same kind of capabilities. So we've been building up some of those core capabilities. I think we'll be able to accelerate into some of that where we see the opportunity. Some of it may be AI, some of it may be more just kind of boring advanced analytics that we all kind of know how to deploy. But really, the primary unlock here is to get that database established in the cloud where we can start to use some of those more advanced analytics. I'd say nothing beyond what we had already anticipated as part of the transaction. So we have been working to -- so margin rates were different. We have been working to kind of normalize the margin rates as we've gone through this process of rate increases. So that gap has decreased somewhat, but there's still a little bit that's going to have to get recognized as the clients move over because the Blue schedule is below the Green schedule. Some of that's intentional so that when clients come over, they will see that they get a price improvement. So we've done some of this to be able to deliver an enhanced experience to the client at the time that they've moved. But we've, in some respects, tried to minimize the impact that's going to flow through financially. Although some of that is still going to get recognized over the course of 2023 as we bring the clients in, it was anticipated, but this is the year it hits. So I think we're out of time here. It's my job to let you know that we're going on a break. We've got 15 minutes. So let's take the break and come on back for the rest of the day. Thank you all. Good to see everybody. [Break]"

            "content": "Our bias towards action when we all stand up about 15 minutes before we're supposed to be up here and lean against the wall and do circles. And we just like to be on the move and it's a little hard standing still anymore, but great to be here. I think Rich said it well in one of the breaks. This is often about what's up here, but it's more about what's down there when we're having conversations. And I hope to be able to turn this conversation around some of our performance in advisory services and with independent advisors into a conversation. So get your questions ready. There's a lot going on. And certainly, the one thing that's very, very consistent in the space is the success of it. Everything else seems to be changing, very much an evolving landscape. But -- and it didn't occur to me when I first asked for this. Everybody likes to talk about what we are and who we are and print articles and talk about that we're not there for something or we are there for something else. And so we thought it was really, really important as we were about to welcome in all of these new TD advisors that we told them who we are. And so I said to Tracy help me with this presentation. So let's start with the pledge that we put out there. What didn't occur to me at that point in time, and I was so happy we started with the pledge was the fact that when I launched the pledge, it was with all a few in February of 2020. And that just -- when I was sitting there thinking to myself, that must have been when we first put the pledge out. So it was that porpoAnd the 3 years that were mentioned in -- since we've been together living in this place. The a little box that we look at on our screen. But I want to remind everybody we have a pledge out to advisors, and it's so critically important because these are businesses. These are people who entrust their franchise to us as the custodian, and they don't know us, some 7,000 or 8,000 of them that are coming over. And maybe they've read some of the articles or have been told some of the stories about who we are, and that was the whole purpose of the pledge. What are we going to do now that we've taken this large share of the marketplace and how are we going to help them continue to grow their franchises. So most importantly, we are there for every advisor that's serious about being in business. We're not there for clubs and people who are just sort of kicking the tires or maybe have some powers of attorney on accounts. But if you're serious, we want to be in business with you. My job has never been to tell you when you're successful or what size you're at when you're successful -- so we have a lot of small firms. In fact, 80% of our firms are under $200 million. And we have far more small firms at Schwab before we even engaged ourselves with TD Ameritrade. That's important to remember. So there's no asset under management minimum we have. There's no custodial fees, and we don't plan on putting custodial fees in. Starting to hear through the industry about custodial fees as the economics get more challenged. And for some of those who don't have the opportunities that we have that don't have a bank, don't have the breadth of services and don't have the scale, they're starting to talk more about having asset management fees or custody fees, we have and will not have those. And we have no intention to introduce a minimum, I want to say this very clearly, nor do we have any intention of putting in a custody fee for advisors? -- best-in-class technologies. Christian asked me the question when we started , did you just embrace all of the TD technology? I think there was a belief out there that TD had a superior technology to what Schwab had. And I think in some cases, it was true. And in some cases, it wasn't. So you'll hear me talk more about this, but we took a look at both platforms independently and honestly and try to make sure we kept the best of both of what we were seeing. And we kicked the tires and all the APIs, and we'll talk more about that in making sure we could bring the services to advisors that they really needed. The best and brightest service professionals, I'm going to lay claim because I've been in this business for a long time now at Schwab. We have the best people. We have always known that this is a relationship business that never alluded us for a moment and making sure that we hire the best, retain the best and kept them in sea as long as we could before we had to promote them into even more broader roles to pursue their careers. We've been good at doing that. And technology is an augmenter really of those people and a deep relationship. After all advisors are in the relationship business, and they expect us to be in the relationship business with them. Practice management. We started this a decade ago, critically important, making sure that we're helping clients to grow their businesses. That's how we grow. Most of our growth is organic, as you can see from the numbers. And so making sure that we're out there, helping them to think about their futures, thinking about their successors, thinking about how they create firms that are multigenerational, has long been part of what we're doing. And I'm pleased to say that many of our TD colleagues now as they've joined us are recognizing, hey, that platform, we thought we had that as well yours a little better. You've got a little more than we had, and so it's all become additive. And then we talked about an account opening process that would be digital. Now -- the good news about this line item is it's not what I really I'm going to talk about further into this conversation. This was about making sure people understood we're not going to make you get wet signatures when we do this transition. This was about the ease of coming over that you've heard Joe talk a lot about, you've heard Jonathan talk about, which is a process that is well underway with advisors. That's what we meant by saying a digital process. I'm going to talk to you about a digital process we've now created for all the business that clients are winning and how successful it's going to be in the industry and it's going to revolutionize how you bring a new client to the firm and how easy we can make that for you to do it. I do want to stress that point, though, about as you talk about the transition. I'm not going to spend a long time on the integration. It is important to recognize that because these are businesses, our integration with advisors started 2 years ago when we first announced this. Advisors, we shut down the idea of having new advisors join the Ameritrade platform. They can put new accounts on the Ameritrade platform, but every new advisor at that point in time, joined the Schwab platform. And so we've -- we're well underway in the process of transitioning those over. So let's talk about the change in the industry. It's getting dramatic. And you could see the success we've had, as I said, that's the one thing that's been there consistently at 13% CAGR. I think I used to talk to you 3 years ago and through our virtual update, we used to talk a lot more about a 10% CAGR. Certainly, this has been a successful industry. It's drawing assets away. Jonathan mentioned some statistics about the retail market. We at Schwab all feel the same way. the assets, our growth is out there. It's not even necessarily with competitors. We have a small fraction of what is a very, very successful marketplace, and we are going to continue to exploit that in every way that we can. And as I think about what's going on in the marketplace and the growth that we've seen and the CAGR that we're enjoying, I think about everything that's happening from within that marketplace, M&A. There's -- you could argue, and I do often with our industry colleagues, there's a lot of M&A. Well, there's not really very much at all M&A at all. The truth is we did about 300 deals last year, but up about 5% from the year before, which is dramatically up from the year before that. But deals are happening constantly. -- firms are coming together, and they're coming together to grow. I think that's the important aspect of it. The M&A is being done because firms are seeing opportunities to merge together to create more centralized services to build scale, which is also important to advisors and maybe not -- had this debate with a client in my office the other day, maybe not as important to an advisory firm, but important. Certainly, fees are not going up for anybody, including advisors. And hence, we have to make sure that we can cover more assets with similar cost structures, and they're starting to get that idea as well. And as we continue to move forward in creating those opportunities for advisors, they will continue to bring more assets in. And the M&A that's happening within advisory firms is going to create more success within those firms. The concept you'll hear us talk about this a lot going on the -- going forward. The concept as rep as portfolio manager is starting to change. centralized services used to be done around operational functions. It's going to be a lot more, I think, about sort of the strategic and the more important relationship functions that are within a firm as we go forward. So we'll keep an eye on that, and we'll keep updating you on where we think that's going and the opportunities that we have. There's also a lot of capital coming into the space. It's been recognized as a successful place. Why wouldn't capital want to be here. You're seeing some of the likes of CI Financial coming in and acquiring firms in mass and with an intent to build those centralized services and scale. They've taken a lot of like firms and trying to create a capability there and doing it with advisors at the helm. Sometimes this is a retirement strategy. Quite often, what it is, is trying to create that multigenerational firm I talked about before. So you have 2 types of M&A there. You have money coming in, third parties acquiring in a successful way, I may say, and then you have advisors acquiring advisors. The thing that still alludes me, I've said this to you before, is I thought the M&A would focus itself more at the lower end of the market because of the complexities of regulation, the cost of operations, the ability to scale or the inability to scale a smaller firms, and it hasn't. M&A has really resided in the $1 billion space mostly, large successful firms coming together with other large successful firms. So we have to keep an eye on that and continue to monitor how that's going to change the landscape of what's going on. The target always being taking more assets away from the traditional models. That's the most important thing that can happen here. So as we continue to talk about the change that's happening, no one in this industry is staying in their lane. Everybody is looking to get involved in some other aspects of the business. Much of that, I think, has to do with chasing different revenue streams and opportunities. Some of it has to do with reaction to legislation and regulation or proposed legislation and regulation and trying to grab a spot there. We're seeing a lot of consolidation of providers. It's never been easier to go independent. And much of that is because fintech arrived on the scene in a big, big way. providers arrived on the scene in a product type way. And the open architecture nature of the independent space is really what's been driving its success. I may add that we are part of that open architecture in every particular case. Our capabilities sit right on the shelf, along with others, but the independence is what is so critically important to advisors, and we have to make sure that we're maintaining that. I think about what's going on with some of the providers like Envestnet announcing they're going to be in the custody business, I found that quite interesting. It's really hard to be in the custody business. I can attest to that. I remember when a competitor many years ago announced in November, they were going to be in the custody business with advisors by February and didn't laugh because we are paranoid, and we take everything quite seriously. But I knew that was impossible to build a platform of that magnitude. And I think to myself, why wouldn't Envestnet think they want to be in the custody business. And then I start to think a proposed regulation and legislation around outsourcing and what that could potentially mean. Interesting possibility Goldman talked about wanting to be in the custody business. I'm not so sure they're there any longer. This is a business you need to love in order to stay with it. I say that's a walk all the time. Can we love a business that's a 9 bp business, 9 bp net. And we are -- and we do, but it is a hard business, and it's a business that's taken us 2 decades to build in making sure that we can get all the capabilities that advisors want. I wouldn't quite say it's bespoke, but our job is making sure when an advisor has a need that we can fulfill unmet need. You've probably seen us go out, make a couple of passive investments. One pass one actually more of an ownership investment or investment in Dynasty. I think some of you may be curious about that. Dynasty is one of those solutions that exist in the marketplace that help to bring assets away from the more traditional models, not to demonize those models, but that's our job, trying to get more people interested in the independent space. And Dynasty has done a fantastic job in doing that. They have 25 of their firms on our platform as a custodian, and we've created a fabulous partnership along with them. And there's others in the industry, but they asked us if we like to be part of it Absolutely, we want it to be part of it. And so we made a nominal capital commitment to them in a passive kind of way because they're helping the industry grow. And who knows? Will we do more of those perhaps but it will have to be under the same kind of criteria as we think about it. Another deal we did recently was Family Wealth Alliance. In fact, just a couple of weeks ago, some of you asked me about that, we've become much, much bigger in the family office space. We now have 80 family offices that we cover through our model, 60 people dedicated to that. It's a really important space. Clients have more than doubled their size of accounts affluency, certainly driving up the change. And it's our job to make sure that we're creating capabilities that make sense for our family offices, many of which are multifamily offices, which were our clients already. And we had capabilities, but branding it has made a real difference in getting something like a family wealth advisor that's been around since 2003, with credibility covering 25,000 families, $450 billion in assets, not all on our platform either, which is kind of neat. And a guy like Tom Libergood, who created it that long ago, and we've been working with for the last decade as well, I think, is going to be very, very positive for us in continuing to penetrate that market from multifamily and into the single-family offices, getting exposure to those people. I opened by talking about the community and how important the community of people can be. Well, when you deal with family offices and many of you might not know this, the value of them is coming together more than anything. Often, their needs are economic, financial, but often not. -- security, travel, capabilities, services around the world. That's what they want to talk to other family offices about , and we then have the ability to bring them to bear in those conversations. And that's certainly going to make a big difference for us in penetrating those markets. So we're quite excited about being able to do more of that. And we'll look for those opportunities. These are not big M&A deals. They're additive to what we're doing. And if you look at FWA, family wealth Aliante, they look an awful lot like our consulting offer. So why not go out and get something that's in place and running and get into this place right away. And so to decide the consultative services that we've built over the past decade for premium firms and other firms throughout our network to make sure we continue to help them grow. So lots going on in that space. As we talk about the growth of the industry, one thing I would highlight to you, 15 straight quarters of 2:1 TOA ratios of assets coming away from others. That's a critically important dynamic that we have to continue to watch, bringing assets in, bringing in share of market, winning against our competitors. I would say our #1 advantage right now in the marketplace is capability. But most importantly, it's focus and consistency. We're in this business. Lots of other people say they want to be in the business. Lots of other people were in the business. Some other people are saying they're still in the business. I don't see the evidence of all of it. I see us with the assets that you can see on the right-hand side, half the firm's assets in this business, 1/3 of the revenue, this is really important business to Charles Schwab, and we're never going to forget that. I see lots of people smartly saying 13 CAGR, very successful place, lots of P&E capital coming into it. I want to be in that business. but can they get there? Do they really want to be there? Can they stay there, get there, stay there and be there through a lot of different economic climates, we can. We've got that scale, that earlier question from Christian. We clearly have that scale in this space. In fact, you can believe these numbers and not believe these numbers are all kind of bantered about, but Suruli talks about there being like 16,000 or 18,000 advisors. Conservatively, I will tell you that we are doing business with 85% of those advisors. Not always is the primary, but we have some form of business with 85% of advisors in the industry, and that's significant. And our aspiration is always to be the primary in every one of those relationships. So we'll keep stressing forward on all of those. Deal size, I talked about -- I did talk about the deal size coming to us. It's growing. Firms are larger when they come into the independents, but they're smaller as well. It's easier to be an independent. So we often see them come. Another sort of fun fact to side that, that we're seeing is there are twice as many transactions happening today that happened 2 years ago of $10 million or more generational wealth transfer is moving forward, and is moving forward at a very rapid pace. So if you think about our advisors being the same age as our clients, our clients are starting to pass their wealth on to that next generation, which is further stressing, I think, the industry to update itself and to make sure they're current for those next generation of assets. Sometimes they're going to a single individual, often they're being fragmented. Advisors are going to have to evolve. And because of that, we're also seeing the emergence of strategic firms in the industry. Firms that come together, I can mention a few, but you could think about high tower and focused financial. Firms that are very aggressive and trying to make sure their capabilities are staying current with the markets so they can continue to grow. And when I say their capabilities, usually it's an agglomeration of advisors and their capabilities. Let's be honest. As the market moves quickly and evolves quickly, it's not serving anybody well to be standing alone, and not taking advantage of a great custodian and the evolution of the business or perhaps taking advantage of an enterprise firm that's in the consolidation business, a mariner, the list is long as you go through. In fact, when we talk about deal flow, there's often 10 or 12 firms bidding for business that's in the marketplace. There's no shortage of demand and capability. And then you think about the other side of the marketplace, the independents or the IBDs -- they're here to stay. They've had some success. LPL talks about taking yet another run at this space. I think they've had great success in building models that help to retain the assets they've had, but can they attract assets. I think that's probably a question that remains. The regionals, Raymond James, they're out there. We still don't see a lot of success against the independent model, but they're trying. And so add them to the list of others who say they want to be in this space, they want to be in the independent space. And remember, you can always move to fee. That's probably the step 1 of moving to independents as a custodian, gets really, really hard when you start talking about open architecture product and you start giving up that revenue flow that comes with your captive product, your IPOs and your capital markets. And so I think you're going to see this only go so far that competition can come. We did $30 billion in net new assets in our new-to-industry assets, $18 billion of those came from wirehouses. So we're still continuing to see the success that comes along with that. And wirehouses again waffling just a tiny bit on, am I going to buy revenue flow? Am I going to rent revenue flow? Shouldn't I? Am I going to trade teams with other teams? And while they're doing that, good firms, large firms, in some cases, firms with tens of billions of dollars are just coming out into independent saying, I'm not playing that game anymore. I'm going to go out and I'm going to create a legacy here. I'm going to create a firm where I have terminal value in it that I can trade. I'm going to build a firm that can work for the people and the clients that I have. So we'll continue to see some of that growth. But with that, there's another challenge. When I talk to advisors, they always talk to me about technology and talent being their 2 #1 concerns, and they should. So we're heavily, heavily invested. I think we put $18 million since 2007 into university CFP programs, and university grants, not grants that necessary get our name on the door anywhere, but programs that are starting to bring help and capability into the marketplace, programs that are designed to make sure that their diversity of talent is getting better, whether it's ethnicity, sex, it is so important that we continue to move this industry to a place that represents the clients. And we've kind of been stuck, again, in most of the industry being post 55, a lot of [white male], not necessarily the demographic of the client base any longer. And so we're working hard at making sure that we're driving success into the universities at an early age and trying to create more opportunities in the historically black universities, certainly, other opportunities. The goal, if you look at this right now, the goal here, as I said to the team, is to try and get every state to have a blue that we can bring in. I remember when it was odd for us many years ago to have students that are impact events. So if you notice them there, there would be 10 or so wandering around, they'd be wearing school shirts. We now have 100 every year who come. And not only that, more importantly, everybody else at their conference started bringing students as well. If they hire 70,000 more people in the next 5 years, 70,000, where are they going to come from? How are we possibly going to do that unless we promote this at a very, very early part of people's career development. We're building a firm of the future while delivering on promises to clients, enhancing our control is critically important in this conversation. We had a little bit earlier, Michael and I were having this -- we're a $3.4 billion, $3.5 trillion franchise for advisors. We can't take risks with that, not because we can't as the firm Charles Schwab, which of course, we want to be very careful with. But our clients tell us, don't be a Page 1 headline. We can't afford to take that. We tell our clients their assets are safe with you. And so we have to have the right control as we bring these two teams together. And I will tell you, we did it with the people. We had lots of replacements, lots of people where we took our TD partners and replaced some of our Schwab partners, and then we have to do it on technologies as well. APIs are something that frequently comes to mind. We have 190 now. They're not all with TD APIs. They're not all with Schwab APIs, they are combination of we deem to be the absolute best in the industry. And we have a sandbox for those who want to come along and maybe try some stuff out with us. But we're not going to put that sandbox into production and jeopardize our clients, I promise you that. New launches, T. Rowe Price, institutional transaction fund, very important that's been waiting for some time. DocuSign 2.0, something that TD had that was really, really good and then the clients like we had to meet them with that one. We think we have a better solution coming through eSignature, but at the same time, we had to meet them now to make sure that they can continue to do their business. And of course, digital onboarding, as I keep talking about that, so important. As we complete the -- really the whole integration, sits top of mind for all of our strategies going forward, digital adoption, our culture, our people, efficiency, wealth management solutions and lending capabilities. Two things I'll highlight there. The digital -- it is a digital onboarding process for advisors. As I said to you at the beginning, it's going to revolutionize and I think it's going to bring a lot more business directly to Schwab because it's going to be ease of doing business is going to make such a big difference in transitioning assets is such a very critical to and lending. I know [Rich], Jonathan, everybody covered this pledged asset lending, so important to advisors right now. We're starting to get our legs under us there. We'll continue down that path. I think originations are going to be right there. And then business lending has to be on the horizon, right, a premier bank that can really serve these institutional firms. And as always, I will highlight to you, and this is just a fun story. I show the slide all the time. We do this all through our client size. We do this all with our clients. These are all clients in our advertising. You should see the glee on TD Ameritrade advisors when they pop up in a commercial. It's like 7 years ago when we first started doing it with the Schwab advisors, they love seeing their face up there on banners in commercials, and they've been coveting this opportunity for quite some time. So quite proud to see the firm coming together. As always, let's go to some questions. Rich has highlighted, I've been around a while. Yes. No, I am shocked by the interest that continues at very, very high multiples. I'm not sure that advisors they're a bit of an all twisted punch. I'm not sure the multiples are what they're moving them, and there are multiple bidders. So that continues. And I do think that firms are going to have to, in some way, change to that or find opportunity. And we're helping some of those consolidators to find opportunities and how they can build those businesses after to create some better economic if that's what they're after. But I do think the centralization of capabilities is what's going to be important in the future. But I don't see the flow going away. I almost hate answering that question because it always sounds like I'm a homer. But at the end of the day, Pershing X, it feels to me -- so I'll give you Bernie's opinions, right? It feels to me which is dangerous and I'm about to get run off the stage with and Fidelity, it feels like they're trying to go back to their DNA of being a fun company, everything is distribution. So that's how I look at our 2 competitors. Still fierce, still with great capability. I could probably tell you more about Pershing than I can about Fidelity because they hide behind that cloak of secrecy of not being public. But I will tell you that when it comes to we will not be outdone, when it comes down to longevity in the marketplace, we will not be outdone. And I think we may find ourselves doing business with Pershing X, and that's just fine. We can do that until we have a capability that's superior. Well, the growth is still coming from outside of the space. So it's not an internal competitive space, right? We have about 1/3 of our clients that we call hybrids. I think the hybrid assets are excluded from that number, but it's reasonably de minimis. When someone comes to us, typically, what they're trying to do is grow themselves out of that revenue stream, and they're quite successful at doing. I just sat with a very large consolidator, I had this conversation the other day from the Midwest. And they're looking at the opportunities of how fast they can remove themselves because they can't be a truly fiduciary as long as they're hanging on to that commission space, right? And they have to keep the licensing and there's all sorts of stuff that comes along with that. So I think that's a de minimis amount. I think the amount of assets that make the most sense are probably the $8 billion to $10 trillion that sits in the wires. And we see a lot of advisors who are in the independent broker-dealer space who are finding themselves to what looks more like an 80:20. Indirectly, I would tell you some of these models that they're trying to hold assets on to in the IBDs are actually helping us because they're forcing advisors to the fee space. And then it's just a small across the street to us or independents in general -- I shouldn't say us, but the independents in general, it's once they get the fee. And if they have a little residual commission business, it can always be handled through -- there's a preponderance of independent broker dealers that can do that. I think I'm out of time. No questions? Awesome. So now I get the pleasure of introducing my friend and colleague who I sit before too. If I forget to introduce you, please just come up, Neesha Hathi. Neesha Hathi, many of you remember, had a cup of coffee with advisory services for a decade. So she's been a key part of ours. She runs wealth and advice solutions now, and she looks after everything in the firm having to do with that and certainly it's going to be a big aid to advisors as well on a going-forward basis."

            "name": "Walter Bettinger",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. It's hard to believe that it's been three years since we were together in person. I think we squeezed this in right before the pandemic. I'm actually dealing today with a non-COVID cold. When I describe a cold, of course, now I have to make sure that it is non-COVID-related, but my voice is a little bit off. If I start to lose my voice, I guess I'll have less to say and maybe that will be a blessing for everyone given my use of a lot of words. But it is wonderful to be with all with you today, and we're looking forward to an exciting day of interaction. So we often talk about our all-weather business model at Schwab and the ability for us to generate strong, powerful results throughout different time frames. And I think if you look back at '21 and '22, you see that illustrated perfectly in the last two years. So in 2021, you had an extraordinary year for equity markets and we dealt with near-record low interest rates, and we delivered record financial results. When you flip over to 2022, you had a near-record year in terms of equity market pain or difficulty. And then we had some of the rapidest increases in interest rates that we've experienced. And we delivered record financial results. And I hope that as I go through my time today, it helps paint that long-term picture. The way we manage the business, the way we think about the business, the way we execute on the business strategy is to deliver those kind of results throughout all different environments, all different cycles that you can count on a long-term perspective. We're going to touch on each of these topics in my section, both our ability to deliver growth consistently through all forms of economic environments as well as return capital during certain periods, such as the one that we're in right now. I'll touch briefly on the Ameritrade conversion, although Joe Martinetto, of course, will go into that in much more detail. And then also I'll touch on how important it is that in our business, we have aligned the areas of significant investment around places in the market where I think we all agree and research shows are the fastest growing. So I mentioned earlier about 2022. We all know it well. No need to necessarily go through the charts and the math. But we know it was a very, very difficult year for our clients, a difficult year for investors. You had both, of course, equity markets and bond markets experiencing tough periods. And not surprising, when you get that type of environment, investors feel it. And so they operated in a bear environment from a mentality standpoint, a sentiment standpoint, throughout almost the entire year. And then, of course, as the year moved forward, we saw greater intensity in terms of yields and flipping with the long-term rates and short-term rates. So we inverted. Through the years though, our clients remain very heavily engaged with us. So we delivered almost $430 billion in net new assets during the year. Interestingly, our clients remained buyers during the years so despite their bare sentiment, there was optimism in terms of being net buyers. Processed about 6 million trades a year, and clients continue to enroll in our advisory offers during 2022. This is a really important slide as I talk about the long-term perspective of the company. We often describe that when you invest in Schwab, you invest in a growth story, and you invest in a growth story that thrives throughout every different type of economic environment. So this slide shares net new assets in -- going back to 2011 and how we are consistently able to deliver within that 5% to 7% range no matter what's going on with the equity markets. Actually '21, we are a bit over. If you look down at the footnotes, you'll notice that we're only including Ameritrade from, I believe, 2020 forward when we got the closing. So actually, if you were to layer Ameritrade on there pre-2020, you would see even stronger numbers in terms of net new assets. But what's important is the consistency, the consistency of our ability to deliver for our clients so that they then turn around and deliver for us in bringing assets into the firm. Now why did they do that? Well, this slide, I think, helps paint some of the pictures. So we refer to it as Client Promoter Score. Of course, many people refer to it as Net Promoter Score. And you can see results across our various parts of the firm. Investor Services at 64. And of course, these are world-class-type NPS numbers for those of you who follow the NPS world. Managed investing dipped a bit in the fourth quarter. But as Neesha will share with you later, 22 of the past 24 quarters, clients who pay us for advice actually had higher Net Promoter or Client Promoter Scores than our self-directed retap clients. So although it dipped a bit, not surprising with equity markets, they are a very happy client. Easy score of 92, and then 83% of our client interactions with one of our representatives resulted in the clients giving us a perfect score, the highest score they could possibly offer us. So underlying facts behind that very consistent ability to grow and deliver net new assets. Of course we receive plenty of industry accolades. I won't spend much time on this. We will hear some more about additional ones of these before long, but they provide some additional boost I suppose, to consumer evaluation. And of course, when you have that kind of consistent organic growth, consistent new asset flows, it puts you in a position to deliver consistent strong financial results, and here you can just see revenue and net income, pre-tax profit margin and diluted EPS again over the last handful of years. Yes, again, over the last handful of years. We tried to go back in this session today and cover a bit more historically because it has been the three years since we year since we were together so normally these would be the things we would be sharing every year, only looking back a year or two, but I thought it was important this time to go a little further back and just reinforce the consistency of our performance. So we like to say at Schwab, it's all about the conversion, but it's also all about a whole series of other things. But we are about to begin the formal conversion here within a couple of weeks. We're very, very excited about that. I know many of the Ameritrade clients are also very excited. We're also really pleased at the response from the clients as we've reached out to them and begun our first transition group here over the next couple of weeks. And we know that this is a big, complicated conversion. No one has ever converted a brokerage business anywhere near this size or scale in the history of our industry, but we feel very confident about where we are. Our test results are late have been delivering the 99.9% accuracy. We don't expect it to be perfect. We try to be very realistic about that. But we do remain quite confident that overall will be a wonderful experience. And when it all is said and done, the clients at both former Schwab as well as the former Ameritrade will have better experience, better tools, better capabilities than either one has had before. So I talked about our consistent ability to deliver results, but I want to just take a step back and again go through why we think that's possible. As you can see on the left side of the slide, we really believe at Schwab that we operate with some structural advantages within our industry, and we look to leverage those structural advantages to better serve clients and better reward our stockholders. Size and scale, relatively unparalleled, certainly within the public company environment. Operating efficiency, we are huge believers that the low-cost provider is the ultimate winner, particularly if being the low-cost provider doesn't involve trade-offs to be able to be in that position. Our service culture, again, I think goes without saying, but everyone is well aware of the quality of our service, our consistency. Look at 2022 for example. We averaged answering the phone last year in about 30 seconds on the Schwab Blue side and about 11 seconds on the TD Ameritrade Green side. Of course, those will come together as we do this conversion. But we answer the phone, we serve our clients, we're there for them. Our branches have been open for several years, and we're ready to serve our clients, and we know that they have a good experience when they interact with us. We have a very efficient operating structure. We don't have [fiefdoms] at Schwab. We have a One Schwab mentality in which everything is about the client. Everything revolves around the client. We work in partnership. We work closely together. We compensate all of our people based on doing the right thing. If you go into a branch and you speak with one of our reps, whether they're talking with the client about a Schwab solution around advisory or working with an RIA, we compensate them in a similar manner. If they're talking about looking at investing in a fund, whether it's a fund run by Schwab or a fund run by a third party, maybe even a third party who provides us no shareholder servicing, we compensate our reps in the same way. We try to structure an operating model which is efficient both for stockholders but also serves our clients well and minimizes the potential for conflicts. Of course, our brand and our corporate reputation ties in with our willingness to disrupt. We have been a consistent disruptor on behalf of our clients, and you should expect that to continue in the future. Let me just go back for one second and touch on two other items here. I mentioned about the and, and it's so important, particularly in terms of being a low-cost provider. We look to not ask our clients to make trade-offs. There's no reason they. Great people across technology and digital experiences and so on, all the way down. And our virtuous cycle also continue at play. You can see it rolling all the way back to our decision to broadly eliminate commission back in 2019 and how it's carried forward to today as we're able to reward out stockholders, and also reward our clients. And of course, you saw the latest example of that yesterday, coming out of our Board meeting where we substantially increased our dividend now up to $0.25 per quarter. As I come down the end of my prepared comments, I just wanted to touch again on the way we think about strategy at Schwab. Everything sits with an overlaying what is going to be best for our clients. At the same time, we identify long-term industry trends. For those of you who have been with me for a long time as we've had these meetings, I would periodically provide to you a list of trends that we viewed were going to be critical in the coming years and how they would shape our strategy. And of course, that continues today. You can see our view on broad trends, client views and the competitive landscape. I just want to emphasize that the two fastest-growing areas in our industry are self-directed investing and the RIA world. And of course, our positioning in both of those spaces, we consider as absolutely optimal. So we have tremendous optimism about our future and our ability to continue to deliver the type of consistent organic growth that you've seen from us and that I shared in the prior charts. So let me just go ahead and wrap up here real quickly, just again emphasizing the consistency of our strategy through clients' eyes. 2022, another record year. We're very excited about 2023. We know it's going to be a transition year. We're going to be doing the largest conversion in the history of our industry. We know that we're dealing with still a somewhat challenging environment for our clients. So we know it's going to be a transition year, but we think it sets us up also very, very well for 2024 and 2025, consistent with the long-term perspective that we have at Schwab. So again, thank you for the opportunity to share with all of you. It is wonderful to be together after three years. And Rick Wurster, a great friend and our President, is going to come up and share some comments. And then I'll rejoin Rick for a Q&A with all of you after Rick has finished his slides. Thank you again. Look forward to our Q&A. Yes. So certainly, I think in the retail side and the advisor side, we have a very, very powerful scale. We would probably be 1 or 2 on the retail side if you incorporate non-public companies. And of course, 1, if you look at public and from a purpose-built platform for RIA custodian, I think we would likely be considered a very strong #1. We have more opportunity in the workplace environment where we have a very strong approach in 401(k) with both a bundled and an unbundled approach and then in the equity comp side, but there's probably more opportunity there to expand scale. Those are often more corporate- or company-driven decisions as opposed to the investor side and the advisor side. I think technology is definitely going to play a role. But to me, if what you're really getting at, Michael, is the idea that someone could leverage technology to make a leap above others in scale, I don't envision that because we're all investing in technology to drive all of our costs down. So as we would evaluate our scale position, technology is going to help those who are less subscale to us, but it's also going to help us and is helping us. And so the relative efficiency of businesses is likely, I think, to continue to be there as we all make meaningful technology and digital investments. The other thing that I think is important in that is that our business model, although it has a significant part that relies on relationship, also has a very significant part that is less relationship-oriented. And so if we're competing against firms that have the majority of their revenue driven off interpersonal relationships, there's only so much scale that can be driven from that because of the compensation for those individuals. Good question. Good long-term perspective thinking. Thanks, Michael. Yes. I mean I think in the short run, you have more variables because we've had such a tremendous swing in interest rates, right, from a ZIRP world to the most rapid increases in rates that we've ever experienced. We went from an incredibly strong equity market in 2021 to 2022. But that's all short term. I think when we flip it around and look at the long-term perspective, I really don't think things have changed that much. Investors still need to plan for their future. They're still saving for retirement. They're still saving to put children through college, providing for other family members. All those factors remain the same. And I think what is important over the three years since we've been together in person is, the strength of our franchise has only grown as we've made investments, as we've leveraged our capabilities, as we are bringing together Schwab and Ameritrade, our offering to clients and prospective clients has never been stronger. So sure, short term, from a financial standpoint, there's more volatility. But from a long-term standpoint, clients are going to returning to Schwab for their needs, I think we're better positioned than ever to deal with them. And I think even long term, financially, we're in a better position, again, illustrated in 2021 and 2022. So 2021, the trading aspect of Ameritrade really helped lift our revenue and helped us, in a ZIRP world, deliver record results. And then it turned in 2022 where trading was a bit softer than in 2021, but as rates start to move up, the Schwab part of the economic model really kicked in and helped us deliver record results. So again, I agree, Rich, short term, we see volatility. Long term, we really like our positioning. And we think the combined Schwab-Ameritrade also delivers a lot of benefits financially for our stockholders. So let me start with direct indexing. I think on direct indexing, the big opportunity in the near term is with higher-balance clients. And the reason that, that's where the opportunity is, is because the tax impact at direct indexing has the biggest impact on those clients. And so we came out at $100,000 minimum, which the big direct indexes were at a $250,000 minimum. So we think that was a disruptive move and brings a lot more clients into the fold who can benefit from the tax benefits. I think that as we move forward, as this space evolves, I do think the minimums will come down. And I think the primary reason for that will be the desire for personalization because I think what you'll find is the lower-balance client -- the idea that you want personalization will appeal to any wealth level. Now there's some people at wealthier levels that may have concentrated positions. And you can do some really interesting things for wealthy clients in building a more personalized index portfolio because if you have a lot of exposure to Schwab stock, you could build an index that not only takes out Schwab but is built from a factor standpoint to be almost the opposite of Schwab so that you can, with your Schwab stock, get back to the index level performance and think about it holistically. So there's a lot you can do for wealthy clients, but also for less wealthy clients. So I do think the minimums will come down over time, and we've been building our capabilities to be able to do that in terms of our fractional share capabilities. Just more work to be done, but I think the industry will move in that direction over time. I just don't think it's important to do so today. We're at a phase where we're still educating that first wave of movers and those are going to be our higher-net-worth clients, and that's where we want to keep our focus. On the advice side and the Ameritrade, I'd say a couple of things. I mean, I think it goes back to the -- what I mentioned earlier that Ameritrade colleagues will tell me they were #1, being #2. So most of their clients that came to Ameritrade for trading actually had full-service wealth advice relationships. They just weren't with Ameritrade. So it's clear to us that there is interest among the client base. And I would just say, 10 or 15 years ago, people used to say similar things about Schwab. You probably won't be able to grow advice. People come to you for transactional reasons. And of course, it's grown markedly over the last 10 to 15 years. And I think our Ameritrade clients are in a similar position. So we are confident. And we've already seen the benefits. I mean, I think 46% of our Ameritrade financial consultants have already opened an account in Schwab Wealth Advisory, which is a pretty remarkable number given they're not even fully Schwab -- embedded in Schwab yet. And they've had some higher hurdles to overcome to introduce that to their clients in a Schwab financial consultant. So that's a pretty remarkable number. So we see a lot of promise there. And then on the lending side, I can't remember the challenge you mentioned, but do you mind reiterating the challenge you saw on the lending side? One real quick thing on the lending side, I completely agree with what Rick said. I want to go back to being a low-cost provider. So in virtually every type of market environment may be other than one where you have ultra-high interest rates, our cost of deposits is less than almost everyone. And so when you combine a most efficient operating model with the lowest cost of deposits, puts us in a position to be able to offer very disruptive lending rates to our clients in what is, for many ways, a commodity-oriented product, borrowing. And so we're in a position, I think, over time to be quite disruptive with the lending rates we can offer clients and yet still generate for us incremental revenue on a spread to securities basis. So we have a pricing opportunity there that I think you'll see us taking advantage of given our low cost of deposits and our low operating model. Do want to take that or do you want me to... Well, I would say our plan for doing that starts with building a relationship with them. And our -- the work we've done with our financial consultants and what we've brought to our clients in terms of advice, I think, is going to be the model for what we do with our Ameritrade clients. The Ameritrade relationship model has been a bit more service-oriented and a bit more trading-oriented because that's what clients came to Ameritrade for, and that's what made sense. And the journey we've been over the last 10 to 15 years, again, 15 years ago, there might have been some of that in the branches as well at Schwab. And we've turned the relationship much more into a wealth management relationship, where we're helping the client with all aspects of their financial life. And so as we do that and as we follow that playbook with our Ameritrade clients, we think will unearth all kinds of opportunities. There are full-service wealth business that may be elsewhere, they're 401(k) that may be elsewhere. But it starts from, to the client, how can we help you achieve your financial dreams? Let's look at your picture today, let's look at where you need to get to, and let's talk about the breadth of capabilities that we now have collectively at Schwab and Ameritrade that can help you get there. So I would take exception to the concept that someone else is growing faster. Are you measuring percent? Are you measuring real dollars? I just -- I don't look at anyone who's generating the type of growth that we're generating in real dollars in the -- in our industry. So I'm not quite sure I buy into that notion. I guess if somebody has a $1 and they add $1, it looks like 100% growth. If someone has $1,000 and they add $250, it's only 25%, but I'd sure rather be the second person. So I'm not sure I buy into that. And when I look at the TOA ratios, it's just -- again, the theory behind that doesn't hold any water because we know where we are on a TOA basis against all the firms that we compete with. And those numbers range from probably a worst-case scenario of around 1. So it's just a swapping. The best-case scenario is that can be measured into double digits. And some of the firms that talk about growth rates, particularly measured in percent, are some of the firms that we're taking assets at a double-digit to 1 type TOA ratio. So we -- when it comes to competition, I just want to emphasize, we respect everyone. We are paranoid, and we spend a lot of time studying competition and their moves and their opportunities and advantages they might have in their model relative advantages we might have. But when it comes to organic growth, we don't think anyone within our two primary areas, retail investor and RIA, is growing at rates comparable to us. That's just our take on it, Christian. Sure. Thanks, Bill, for asking the question out there in cyber land. But -- so we look at a lot of opportunities. As you can imagine, we receive a lot of inquiries with interest in -- from firms that are looking to sell or divest parts of their business. We look at everything. We look at it all carefully and closely. Our view there hasn't changed from my response to that question in years past. It's got to make sense for clients. That's the first step, the first hurdle that it has to address. Is this going to put us in a better position to serve client? If it does, then we'll go into the next steps and look at whether it makes economic sense for our stockholders, what the ROI is, what the risk is associated with doing that transaction, risk to our brand but also risk to our ability to deliver the results. Because when we undertake an acquisition, we're very committed to recognizing that it is your money or your clients' money that we're putting into that deal. So that we just have a very thorough evaluation on any kind of acquisition. International is a meaningful opportunity for us. I think Jonathan will be in a good position to share some of our thoughts there. Our dollar-based international business is growing quite rapidly. And so there is some meaningful opportunity there. To date, we have not been aggressive around multicurrency. But the dollar-only part of that business has significant opportunity that Jonathan can share in his segment. I think we're at the end of our Q&A time. So again, I just want to thank all of you for being here today in person, thank all of you who are participating remotely. It is wonderful to be together. I can't wait to do it again. I'm very confident it won't be three years. And Rick, thank you for giving me the chance to share the stage with Q&A. I'll step off, and I think you'll introduce Joe. Win and we lose through our advisors. Advisors are adept at getting involved with families way downstream. And so they're keeping the assets. But what they need to do is they need to be building models within their slightly different way than they might have served the parents assets, right? I think virtual, I think this is one of the silver lines of COVID, I think we've learned a lot through all of that. I think they have an opportunity to create different portfolios for this group. Asset accumulation versus de-accumulation, if you will, is something that they're all starting to focus an awful lot more on. And I think M&A is going to play a little bit of a role in here too, in creating some more of those centralized services. Some firms are using junior partners and assigning them to the books of these smaller clients as well. Well, advisors are continuing to load and something we should be talking about is their movement into alternatives, which has been quite prolific recently, using things like iCapital so important case management, just 2 examples of third-party platforms we have in that open architecture environment I mentioned. Clients don't want to pay transactions, and yet there's pressure on economics across the board. And so I think no loads are coming into the SEC has entered into it. They're class, best-in-class share is something that they're looking deeply into. And so I think you're seeing advisors now really revisit that, along with the fact that they're coming to realize that the idea is rep as the portfolio manager is something they need to move away from. That's going to be gradual, and it's going to take some time. But I think we're going to see more of that migration. And I think there's space there for us and other third parties and overlay-type management. I didn't mention iRebal and thinkpipes when I was going through some of those best of both worlds. But I think our model marketplace is going to play a very big role in the future as well. Our combined TD and Schwab..."

            "content": "Thanks, Jonathan. As you've heard many times already today, the external environment has created some headwinds. And as expected, our new client outcomes have moderated as a result and yet we continue to perform at pre-pandemic levels. So in 2022, we acquired 1.2 million new clients. Those are clients who entrusted us with their money to help them grow and manage their wealth. And it was the third highest year in terms of new clients that both Ameritrade and Schwab have ever seen. In addition to continuing to acquire a large number of new clients who entrust us with their money, the profile of the clients that we're attracting has been consistent and very attractive. So of almost 60% of the new clients that we acquire are under the age of 40. And at the same time, maybe on the other side of the coin, we're seeing a significant increase in the number of new clients who are funding to affluent, defined here as 250,000. So we saw a threefold increase in the number of clients who upon becoming new clients fund affluent. There are a couple of data points that we look at to understand the profile of the new clients that we're attracting. I'll point out a couple of them here. The first, you've heard many people already today talk about TOA ratio. When we see more new clients funding with securities than cash, it's a signal to us that we are winning business from competitors because that is already invested money. When we're winning cash, it feels like we are winning new money to market. And we're starting to see an improvement. Of course, in '20 and '21, we saw a lot more cash. Now we're starting to see more funding via TOA. We're also seeing initial funding increase, and that's probably also a function of the fact that it's already invested assets. But we've seen more than 100% increase in initial funding rates. And finally, and this shouldn't surprise any of you, as I'm sure it's similar to your behavior as a consumer. We continue to see an increase in the number of new clients who are opening via mobile or web rather than physically in a branch in person. This success is driven, as you've heard a couple of times already today by a diversified acquisition strategy that has remained consistent. Similar to an investor's diversified portfolio, each lever in our acquisition strategy serves a different purpose and balances one another. I'll share a little bit more about marketing in a minute here, but it's one of the most significant contributors to our new client outcomes, driving about 40% of our outcomes consistently over time. Whether it's a financial consultant inviting a prospect to a ballgame or whether it's one of our phone teams, picking up the call -- picking up the phone and making a welcome call. We know that people are central to our value proposition. And in fact, earlier, I referenced that we're seeing an increasing number of new clients opening accounts online. Well, if a new client opens an account in a branch, we see 6x the average funding of an account that's opened online. That is, of course, both a function of the type of person who is attracted to walking into a branch. And it is also a function of the relationship and the conversation that the financial consultant can have with the new client. Our relationships with employers introduce Schwab to their participants, which in turn creates affinity so that when those participants have needs beyond their 401(k) or their stock plan Schwab could be there to support their financial wellness. And as the workplace business grows, of course, the opportunity for retail growth. And finally, as Jonathan just referenced, core to what we do is delivering an exceptional client experience. And in turn, when we do that, our clients refer us. They talk to their friends about their experiences at Schwab. With the addition of Ameritrade's trading capabilities that you just heard a fair amount about and also their incredibly robust educational content, each lever in the acquisition strategy becomes stronger. We have more things to talk about in marketing. Our people have more ways to help. We have more things to offer our participants in workplace. And finally, we have more reasons to love us so that they will refer us to their friends. I promised I talked a little bit more about marketing, which is a significant contributor to our new client growth. And our approach is central to our success. It starts with very clear design targets, which allows us to be focused not only in our messaging, but also in our media buys. And of course, with the addition of Ameritrade's trading capabilities, we see tremendous opportunity ahead to be a lot louder in terms of our trading capabilities targeting active traders. So just like each lever in our acquisition strategy serves a purpose so does the channels through which we communicate with prospects and existing clients. And what I'd like to do is use a consumer trend that we're seeing to illustrate how those channels play together. So Jonathan referenced earlier that we're seeing increased engagement in our educational and market insight content. This isn't super surprising, given what's been happening in the market. But we've seen interest in content absolutely triple. So while we do use paid media to amplify our education and our experts voice, -- we also focus very much on the experience that you get when you come to Schwab.com. So you come to consume the education, but then it's our responsibility to ensure that you stay engaged by serving up an experience that makes it obvious as to what your next step should be. We also are expanding our owned channels. Many of you have probably increased your podcast consumption over the past several years, and we want to be where investors are. And so we now have a podcast. Jonathan referenced this earlier as well, where we've seen just incredible interest from prospects and from existing clients. And finally, of course, we use Earned media or PR, also to amplify our experts voices. Perhaps more important than how we do what we do is the -- that was what we do. Sorry, the channels is how we do it. And consistent with our challenger heritage, we're continuously disrupting ourselves to figure out how to market and how to market relative to our competitors. So I'd like to spend a minute talking a little bit about how we use measurement, creativity and innovation to set ourselves apart from the category. So Jonathan referenced our marketing synergies earlier. And with media inflation, it's more critical than ever that every dollar that we spend is as efficient as it can be and analytics is the way that we achieve that. I'll just touch on a couple of examples here of some of the analytics that we use. The first is relatively new, which is called a multi-touch attribution model, and that enables us to see how all channels, whether they are offline or online, work together to deliver outcomes. The reason why this is so important is that with cookie redaction, most advertisers lost their ability to see the prospect or client journey and seeing that journey is how we deliver efficiency. So what we've done is created a solution where we have a privacy compliant first-party tag, the reason why the cookies went away was a privacy issue. And we are building a model where we will be able to see how touch points from the branch network to schwab.com to digital advertising, work together and contribute to every new client and every dollar that new client brings to us. Our marketing mix optimization model is an econometric model that we use regularly to help us refine our media allocation across channels and also to help us anticipate outcomes. We're constantly improving the model. It has controlled variables like the number of branches that we have or what's happening in the external environment. And we add predictors of outcomes. For example, this year, we added personal savings rate, which probably is no surprise to you, tends to be a pretty good predictor of our outcomes. We also changed our media buy based on what we see from the model, and I referenced earlier, podcasts and education, where we have recently increased our media spend in audio and in what we call native, which is where we distribute our education to where investors are seeking to consume education. And like many things at Schwab, our approach to marketing is a little different than the category. We do engage in all of the [indiscernible] channels. They are workhorses for us, but we do it in a way that sets us apart from the competition. So taking advertising as an example, a lot of competitors in our category advertise the category, they advertise financial planning or the benefits of wealth management. We believe that we have to advertise in a way that is tangible and uniquely solves an unmet client need. So recently, we launched a campaign called Humans. I referenced earlier that our people are central to everything we do at Schwab. And each video in the humans campaign demonstrates our shared commitment to serving clients and brings to life a tangible point of differentiation, many of which Jonathan referenced in his presentation, whether it's our service or our satisfaction guarantee or in the case of Jim Tides, one of our financial consultants who tells the story about his father's business and how important it was to him to be clear and transparent with his clients about how much they were paying. He talks about what price transparency is important to Schwab and how that informs his approach to his practice. I'm also sure many of you recognize our friend Carl. Carl, is our antihero. He is the broker that represents what our competitors cannot do so that we can crisply articulate what we can do. And both humans and Karl consistently test in the top 5 in the industry in terms of TV advertising. Getting a little jump through there, sorry. Finally, lots of people have probably been to a golf tournament with a financial services firm. I'm sure you've stood there and watched on the fairway. This is another place where we continually innovate. Let's start with the fact that we named the tournament that we sponsored the Charles Schwab challenge in -- consistent with our heritage. We wanted to telegraph what it is that we stand for through the tournament. We also viewed the tournament with all kinds of innovations that were driven by both the players experience and the guests of the financial consultant's experience, whether it was a moment of silence because the tournament takes place over Memorial Day or the car that everybody loves to talk about, traditionally, you get a Tartan jacket and a trophy when you win a golf tournament, we kitted out a car that stands for something unique at Schwab that the winner of the tournament received and drives away with, which has been just tremendous from a media bus perspective. And finally, our competitors tend to host large events. They tend to focus it on the category. They want to talk about what they do. We do that, too, but the way in which we do it more creatively is we tap into clients' passions. So an example of this is that for Schwab investing themes, we are tapping into people's passion for beer, which seems like a rather obvious one, but we have different types of beer that tie to the different themes that enables us to then have a conversation about why you might be interested in renewable energy. This, of course, is just one example, but one that shows tremendous engagement because we're listening to the client. I mentioned earlier some of the innovations that we've done when we see consumer behavior changing or when we see the media landscape changing. I'll start with -- we do use traditional channels, but we're also looking for ways to engage with prospects in high engagement categories. You may be surprised to learn that 65%, 2/3 of adults use some gaming platform. And Jeff Kleintop, our Chief Global Investment Strategist, is one of that 65%. So he recently held a session on Twitch with the gamer, the purpose of which was not to equate investing in gaming. The purpose of which was to go to a place where investors are highly engaged and educate them about portfolio diversification, asset allocation and risk tolerance in a place where their eyes were glued to the screen. It's a great example of how we go through where consumers are. We all run advertising in traditional media. You see it when you open the Wall Street Journal or when you turn on CNBC. But again, we're looking for environments where we know that eyeballs are watching with their full attention and a really great example of this is holiday movies. So we actually inserted our brand digitally into 3 holiday movies recently on Hallmark and interestingly found that brand recall was higher from those holiday movies than some traditional advertising. Again, it's our insight that, that is a place where people are giving their undivided attention. And finally, last example here, you've all been to a restaurant with a financial services firm, while we upped our game, and we wanted to bring to life what is special about our financial consultants. So we hosted a barbecue cook-off in Atlanta and Denver. And each financial consultant had their own special sauce that brought to life what is different about them. and what the financial consultants love about this is that it enables them to connect in a very human way by something that marketing can deliver. So what do I want you guys to take away before we get Jonathan back up here for questions. What I hope you take away is that even in this difficult external environment, we continue to deliver consistent growth and it's because of our consistent acquisition strategy that is diversified so that in any environment, each one of the levers works uniquely. And finally, with the acquisition of Ameritrade, our value proposition only gets better, and we will, of course, continue to get better at what we do. So John, do you want to come on up and we'll take some questions. Yes, I was going to say. So I mean you did hear from Jonathan, that the marketing synergy was incredibly significant. However, I believe that it's the power of the combined value propositions that will make every dollar will be able to speak to both affluent clients who are seeking a wealth manager and to traders or somebody who's simply looking for a place to place a trade. We're also delivering significant efficiency account, which gives me confidence that we're buying in the appropriate places in the appropriate way and sharing the appropriate messages. Sure. Great. I mean I think central to marketing is being where clients are, I can't expect them to come to us. And I think core to innovation is figuring out where clients are and how we can meet them efficiently. I think a really good example of that is the work that we do with education. So we want to show up where people are curious about investing, whether that is with paid media or with earned media. Of course, once they get to schwab.com, the experience is even more robust, but I can't expect them to start there. So a lot of what we do is think about where are investors, how can we be useful to them in the place that they are and then how can we be there when they need us. I think the second part of that would be about new channels. I mean, I think about the number of ways in which we have to communicate with investors today, and it's much more expansive than it was even 5 years ago using, for example, the podcasts using our digital magazine, -- there are all kinds of examples of making sure that we're creating content in a way that reaches people where they are as opposed to expecting them to come with us to come to us. We're trying to make it simple, as Jonathan referenced."

        "speaker6": {
            "name": "Richard Wurster",
            "content": "Hello, everyone. Welcome to Westlake. It's nice to see so many of you in person. One of the questions I'm often asked by analysts is, can we sustain the healthy levels of organic growth that we've delivered historically now that we're a much larger company? So I'm going to talk about that topic in two parts today. I'm going to talk about what we can rely upon from our virtuous cycle, which we think is the ability to continue that growth. And then secondly, I'm going to talk about our strategic focus areas and the role they can play in accelerating both our organic growth and our revenue. We're in a position of strength today. With over $7 trillion of client assets, we are the leading provider of investing in wealth management capabilities of any publicly traded firm in the United States. And as Walt just mentioned, our growth is supported by the fact that we're focused on the two fastest-growing segments of our market. Underlying our growth is our combination of value, service and choice. You see that in the retail channel, the ability to walk into our branch to call our 24/7 line or to deal with our outstanding digital experiences, all with products and services priced at great value. In the RIA space, we provide unmatched practice support. We provide unmatched custodial experiences in terms of our digital and technology capabilities that we provide to RIAs at custody with us. And all of that comes with a commitment to no custody fees for RIAs of any size. And in workplace, it's about our solid platforms that are supported by our industry-leading service. You add that all up, and we have a healthy greater than 1.5 TOA ratio. Now for those that have been covering the company for a while, you may recall us reporting numbers closer to 2. And you can rest assured that our Schwab numbers remain at those levels. But I also want to anchor you to the new numbers that we'll report going forward, which are the integrated Ameritrade and Schwab numbers, still a healthy greater than 1.5. And I also want to provide some context for why Ameritrade has historically had lower TOA. What happens with Ameritrade is clients have been attracted to Ameritrade for their trading capabilities. They bring cash in, ready to execute a trade. They grow their wealth over time with Ameritrade. And at some point, their needs change and they want more full service wealth management support. And so they take some portion of those assets or all of those assets and they TOA them out to a fuller service firm. And so the assets come in, in cash and TOA out in securities, creating a lower TOA ratio. So that's why as we report our TOA ratio going forward, you should expect it to be closer to the 1.5 than the 2 that you've seen from Schwab historically. But therein lies an opportunity. Those clients that have come to Ameritrade to trade that have built wealth there, we're going to expose them to our relationship model. We're going to make available our broader wealth support, and we're going to try to keep as many of those clients in the Schwab family as possible because we know when they're at Schwab, they don't have to make any trade-offs. We have a strong market share today with 12% market share, but there's still lots of room for growth for many years to come. The virtuous cycle has been what has driven our growth over time. Walt has said for many years, if we do right by clients, if we see through their eyes, clients will do more business with us. And this is proof that, that approach has worked. When you look back over the long run, we have consistently delivered 3% to 5% of organic growth from our existing clients. That's our existing clients choosing to do more business with us because we've done right by them. Whether it's them investing their dividends and interest with us, we're bringing their hard-earned savings to invest for the future. We've reliably generated that 3% to 5% from existing clients. We've also been able to attract 2% to 3% of organic growth from clients new to the firm. You add that all up, and it's the 5% to 7% growth Walt shared earlier that we consistently and reliably delivered. So now I want to take a moment and talk about why we're confident that we can continue to drive that growth from our virtuous cycle in the future. And it starts with existing clients. Our client base is young and getting younger. Our average client age is under 50, and 57% of our clients that came in new to Schwab last year were under 40 years old. That puts them squarely in the accumulation stage of their life, meaning they're going to need to contribute more assets to save for their future. The other element driving our future growth from existing clients is dedicated relationships. We know that when we have a dedicated relationship with a client, that client is a more engaged client. They have higher Client Promoter Scores, greater satisfaction and as a result, higher retention, and they bring us more net new assets. In fact, they bring us 2.5x more net new assets than those that did not have a relationship. And we continue to invest in and expand the number of clients at Schwab that have that dedicated relationship fueling our future growth. And then third, in our RIA business, as the RIAs who custody with us have success in growing their businesses and as their existing clients bring them assets, that's fuel for our organic growth. So you can see from this that we feel like we're in a really good position if we see through clients' eyes to sustain our level of organic growth from existing clients. In terms of new clients, our recipe is what it's always been. It's about our brand, putting clients first. It's about being a trusted financial services provider as we have been for the past 50 years. It's about our diversified acquisition model. It's about our sales teams, our marketing efforts, referrals, being able to walk into a branch. It all attracts clients to Schwab. It's our workplace pipeline, a business that's an increasingly strategic for us and one that should bring new clients to Schwab. And then finally, it's our commitment to the RIA industry. As more advisors choose to go independent, as the leading provider of custodial services, that will fuel our growth. So we think, as we look forward, we're a much bigger company. This shows -- this to us is evidence that the virtuous cycle will continue to drive that 5% to 7% of organic growth that we've seen historically far into the future even as a much larger company. I want to now pivot to talk about our strategic focus areas and the acceleration they can provide both to organic growth and to our revenue. We've talked a lot about the benefits of the Ameritrade acquisition. It's clear, it's the expense synergies, we've been clear about. The enhancements to our clients, we've been clear about. Our clients are really going to benefit from bringing the best of Ameritrade and Schwab to them, both in the advisor, channel and in our retail business. One of the things I'm particularly excited about is the runway of growth that Ameritrade will provide to us. At Schwab, we have a little more than 50% share of our clients' assets here with us at Schwab. That's 1.5x the share of wallet at Ameritrade. Many of my Ameritrade colleagues will say to me, we're #1 at being #2. And what Ameritrade meant by that was that their clients tended to have a primary financial relationship. And then they would have some of their trading assets with Ameritrade, but they always had that primary relationship. As we introduce clients to our relationship model, our broader set of capabilities, our advice, our financial planning, we believe we can move into that primary financial relationship position and grow our share of wallet with Ameritrade clients. And if we can do that, that's a more than $0.5 trillion of net new asset opportunity for us. And importantly, it's clients that stay in the Schwab family and benefit from all that we have to offer. So it's a real win for clients and it's a win for us. I want to now talk about wealth. I'd like to [say] market for advice. And you can see that on the left-hand side of this page, more investors are willing to pay for advice. We have a really strong wealth platform today. Neesha's going to describe it in a lot more detail later. She'll also describe the enhancements we're making to take what's a strong platform and make it even better for clients. We see room to grow here. 19% of retail assets at Schwab are in an advice solution. As Walt talked about earlier, those consistently -- those clients consistently have our highest Client Promoter Scores and are among our most satisfied clients. They're also ones that were helping along their financial journey and making a real difference in their financial life, fulfilling our mission as a company. You'll also notice on this page that only 7% of Ameritrade assets are an advice solution. We see opportunity to grow both of these numbers, and we also see an opportunity to close that gap between the 19% and the 7% as we introduce the breadth of advice capabilities that we have at Schwab to our Ameritrade clients. For each 1% we can move the needle, first of all, it's more clients that we're helping and making a real difference in their financial life, most importantly. And in addition to that, it's $125 million to $200 million of annual revenue. I want to now talk about direct indexing. Direct indexing is a capability that we think over time will take share from both mutual funds and ETFs. It's a capability that we think to be a market leader is going to take 3 success criteria. We think it will take being a leading indexer. It will take strong digital capabilities because in order to personalize the portfolio, it's going to have to be done in part digitally. And we think it's going to take relationships. And we think it's going to take relationships because many clients aren't aware of the benefits of personalized indexing today. So that one-to-one discussion about how it may benefit an individual client is going to be really important. As we think about those three characteristics, indexing capabilities, digital capabilities and relationships, we believe there is no firm better positioned than Schwab to be a market leader. And as we're a market leader, there's a number of benefits that will accrue to our clients. Over the long run, they should be able to achieve better after-tax returns. And they should be able to personalize their portfolio in a way that meets their needs and allows them to commit to their portfolios for the long term, helping drive better financial outcomes. It's also a space where we can bring our no trade-offs approach and our value orientation to clients and helping make a real difference in their lives. I want to now talk about lending. Lending is an area we've been focused on doing more. And it started with our preferred rate program that we've introduced in the past few years, something that's been very well received by clients as those clients that keep assets with us have been able to access industry-leading interest rates. We've also invested in the past couple of years in making the experience of taking a loan or a poll at Schwab easier to accomplish. This is an area where we think we have more room to grow. Clients come to us for the asset side of their balance sheet. But today, only 0.6% of client assets are in a lending solution. So far fewer are coming to us for the liability side of their balance sheet. And that presents us with an opportunity, an opportunity to do more for the client, to integrate their financial life, to give them a more holistic view of their financial life so that we can help them along the way to their financial dreams. And if we do that, if we can deliver in that way for clients, you'll see for us, we've had 0.6% of total assets in lending solutions. When we look at our peers, that number is about 3.5%. If we can close that gap and do more for clients, that's a $1.5 billion to $2 billion of annualized incremental revenue that we could accrue at Schwab. But again, it's also, we think, happier clients because we know the clients that do have both a lending and investing relationship with us are happier clients and also have higher retention, stay with us longer. I want to now talk about our third strategic focus area, client segmentation, and I want to focus on two segments in particular. First, I want to focus on traders. And you can see from the metrics on the page that the trading segment is a very valuable segment to us, which is why we continue to invest to make sure that the strength of our combined trading platform and the thinkorswim platform that we're bringing on from Ameritrade continue to shine. So we're investing in thinkorswim. We offer differentiated service for our trading clients, and we have an outstanding trading education group, which provides education to traders of all skill levels, helping them to be as successful as possible. On the right-hand side of the page, you'll see our efforts with higher-net-worth clients, an area where we are competitively strong as you can see with our 2x TOA ratio with wirehouses, which is where we tend to compete for these clients. This is an area we've invested in over the past few years, and we'll continue to invest. We've invested in differentiated service experiences, differentiated product to meet the unique needs of higher-net-worth clients and differentiated wealth advice to help clients in that wealth bracket to meet some of the challenges that they may face, all with the goal of making them better off in their financial life. So I'm going to wrap up with where I started. The question I'm most commonly asked by analysts is, can we sustain the level of organic growth that we've driven historically and that Walt shared with you earlier? And the answer from us is a resounding yes. Yes, we can. It starts with the virtuous cycle, driving 3% to 5% of new organic growth from our existing clients and 2% to 3% from new clients. And we can accelerate that via organic growth through the opportunity with Ameritrade that I described earlier and a $2 billion to $4 billion-plus revenue opportunity through both wealth and lending. And it all starts with seeing through clients' eyes. When we see it through clients' eyes and do right by them, that leads to enhanced growth and sustains what you've seen from us historically. And with that, Walt and I are looking forward to taking your questions. I would say, first, it's going to take time. This isn't going to happen overnight. We already have a very strong wealth business that is growing. You'll hear from Neesha later the investments that we're making for the long term. So we see it as a long-term opportunity there. On the lending side, we've done a lot to enhance our capabilities in the past few years. As the lending -- it's going to take those capabilities, which we think are ready for growth, but also probably a different lending environment. And when the confluence of those two things happen, I think you'll see an acceleration in our client lending activity. Sure. Do you mind -- just go through the 3 again because I want to make sure I hit all 3. Yes. Well, that's the opportunity for us, and we've introduced the ability for our relationship people. So Schwab Wealth Advisory for the first time is now able to talk to clients about their -- the lending side of their balance sheet. And it's a focus of the branch network, which Jonathan will talk about. So there's -- we have every reason to believe that we can engage more with clients on the lending side. It hasn't been an area of huge focus in the past for a whole lot of good reasons, but there is an opportunity there in the future. And the reaction to what we've done so far has been quite strong. And when you see client engagement with our lower -- with our interest rate program, which has really lowered the cost of lending for our clients to keep balances with us -- it's been very positive thing with clients. And you see it in our Client Promoter Scores that have both the asset and liability side with us, you see it in the retention numbers. It's stickier relationships. No. Go ahead, please. I'm going to take that. Yes, so alternatives is an area that we have capabilities in today, and clients are utilizing those capabilities, particularly on the advisory advisor side, and Bernie can talk about that more later. On the retail side, it's an area where we are seeing increased interest, and it's an area where we're building out our capabilities as we've talked about in the past. And that will take some time. And the reason it will take some time is that it's a legally complex area to be able to offer alternatives to clients in a way that's safe and sound for them and brings our fiduciary responsibility to bear on the client. So I would say, we're in the middle of building out our alternatives capability. And in the next couple of years, retail clients can expect to have that capability. And I would put it as part of our -- what we're trying to deliver to higher net worth -- ultra-high-net-worth clients that we have been building out our product-specific capabilities for them. We've done it on the liquidity side. We've done it on the lending side, and we're going to do it on the alternative side. But it will take some time because it is a complex area. We want to make sure we do it right in a way that works for the clients. Yes. Joe, well, come up. Joe is going to talk about the Ameritrade integration and scale. So it should be good discussion and timely."

        "speaker7": {
            "name": "Neesha Hathi",
            "content": "Thank you, Bernie. And it's great to be here with all of you today. I know I'm the last thing between you and lunch. So I will keep it moving as I go forward. I think the last time I had the opportunity to spend time with you, I was in a different seat. I was our Chief Digital Officer. And so you might see a little bit of my digital roots, not to mention my advisor services roots come through. But I want to share today on what I'm really excited about, which is actually leading our newest enterprise Schwab, which is called Wealth and Advice solutions. And what I'm going to do is, I try to accomplish 3 things. First, I want to give you a little bit of a lay of the land. So what are all the capabilities that we have in this area around wealth and advice solutions. And you've heard a lot about this opportunity around wealth management today. So I want to bring some of that to life. Secondly, I want to talk about the actual opportunity -- and when you look through it -- look at that opportunity through our eyes, given the growth of these businesses that you've been hearing about all day, we really think that opportunity is tremendous. So a really great opportunity that we believe, we're very well positioned to pursue. And then finally, I'm going to talk a little bit about what are those priorities. So how are we actually going to go and pursue this opportunity and accelerate our growth in this area. So let's dive in. So as I promised, I wanted to start with the lay of the land. And the first thing I would start with is that in that One Schwab spirit that Walt talked about this morning is that our goal here is really to serve all of the clients at Schwab when we think about the wealth and advice solutions that we bring to market. So that includes our retail investors, of course, as well as our registered independent advisors and to a lesser extent, at least for now, our employers and the employees or the participants that work with those employers as well. There are three kind of major components to what we offer in this space. So of course, the investment solutions. So think about this as the building blocks of the portfolio, right? ETFs, mutual funds, separately managed accounts, alternatives. And of course, we have lots of third-party asset managers that we work with there, as well as of course, the proprietary offers that we have and many that we've acquired over the last few years as well. Then in the middle of the page, you see managed investing portfolio solutions. So these are not the building blocks, but these are the most holistic portfolio solutions that we offer. Here you have our flagship offer, our Schwab Wealth Advisory that you heard a little bit about earlier today, but also the great program that we have with our RIA clients, our Schwab Advisor Network, where we work with over 130 RIAs across the country and work with them to refer clients who are a better fit for a high-touch customized offer like what's offered through those RIAs. And then, of course, offers like Schwab Intelligent portfolio, it's premium, where we offer human access to a certified CFP, a certified financial planner, as well as digital advice. So really a robust set of solutions that we have when it comes to managed solutions or those portfolio solutions. And then when you get to the right side of the page, what you see are our experts, our specialty teams. So along with, of course, the building blocks and those portfolio solutions, we have a lot of experts in the house. And these are certified financial planners, folks that specialize in tax, [trust in the states], equity awards, all the various components that you would imagine. I think of these as the wealth management services that wrap around the portfolio, but a key part of the value proposition when you think about a client who's looking for help, guidance and advice as to how to get to better outcomes. And when you bring all this together, it's a significant driver of our revenue. Over $4 billion of our revenue come from the offers and solutions that you see on this page. So the really wonderful thing is that as you can see this big, broad, robust set of capabilities that we already have in the house, our goal is to deliver those capabilities to our clients. And what we know is that when a client engages with us, when they take advice from us, when they engage with us on a financial plan, we have happier clients. And the reason we have happier clients is because they have the confidence, they get the support, they get the guidance that they need to get to their financial outcomes. And the left side of this slide kind of illuminate some of that. So if we think about financial planning, and you heard Jonathan talk a little bit about the financial plans that we deliver. Financial planning is a key component, we think, one of the first steps for a lot of investors. When an investor engages with a financial plan and does a financial plan with us, not only are they more confident, but we see 12x the M&A of a typical retail client. If you think about our offers, Walt talked about this morning a little bit, managed investing, when a client actually is paying us a fee for advice they are more likely to have a higher CPS score. Actually, on average, an offer like Schwab Wealth Advisory has a CPS score of about 10 points higher than the average retail client. Average retail client, by the way, has an incredible CPS score, if you think about the industry out there. But our managed clients are even more excited about being at Schwab more likely to refer and more loyal. And loyalty is actually what the third point talks about, which is in that Schwab Wealth Advisory offer, when a client actually enrolls in that offer, they're much more likely to be retained at Schwab and actually stay in that offer. So they're having a great experience and bringing more of their assets to the offer and referring that offer to other of their friends and family. And then finally, at the bottom of that column, you see even when it comes to digital advice. When you think of digital advice, especially over the last few years is perhaps a more transactional client, perhaps a client that's really still kind of tiptoeing into advice. When we ask our clients how they feel about Schwab Intelligent portfolios, we again see a very high satisfaction rate. We know that clients, again, sometimes what they need is actually digital advice. Sometimes what they need is a consulting with the certified financial planner. And I think one of the real assets that we have is, we have all these capabilities in the house, and we're free to deliver advice and the guidance that they need in lots of different forms, not necessarily the traditional -- you have to have it all this way. At Schwab, you can have it the way that the client really needs. And it really does vary depending on the asset size, their personal needs, where they are in their life trajectory. So when clients engage with us when it comes to advice and guidance, we have happier clients. When we have happier clients, the great thing is we actually drive revenue for Schwab. And what you can see, if you look at the charts on the right side is that the advice solutions of the dark blue part of that bar chart, you can see is growing at a faster rate. Those are those solutions in the middle of the slide that I showed you previously. Those managed solutions when a client is paying us a fee is actually the higher growth area of our AMAF revenue. And also, as you can see by the revenue on client assets and attractive economics, so better, happier clients means with stronger growth for Schwab as well. So as you can see, it's already a robust business. But what I really get excited about is talking about the opportunity because this is a growing opportunity and probably not surprising. As the information out there as investors are hearing all this information about how they should live their financial lives, what good advice looks like, what they should be doing with their portfolio, more and more investors are looking for help and guidance. And actually, I think Rick talks about it as a bull market for advice. What you can see on the left side of this chart, and by the way, this is a Cerulli data, is that more and more investors, no matter what their segment is so, whether they're self-directed or more advice-seeking, you can see that, that's up into the right. They're more and more often looking for advice. And at this point, across the industry, 61% of investors are saying that they're willing to pay for advice, not just looking for it, they're willing to pay for advice. So what we look at is we say, well, that's a great opportunity across the industry. But what about our clients? How do our clients feel? Well, when you look at the right side of the slide, we see a really great opportunity. So when you ask -- when we ask our own clients, our Schwab clients and say, would you be willing to pay for advice? We actually do this in an investor profile survey that we do regularly. Are you willing to pay for advice? 37% of our own Schwab clients are willing to pay us for advice. And by the way, the dark blue bar chart shows you that only 11% of those households actually do pay us for advice. So we have a real opportunity here where we have clients who are saying that they want advice and only 11% that are actually paying us for advice. And actually, we talked a little bit earlier, there was a great question in the audience here around Ameritrade clients. And are they more trading-oriented and would they be willing to pay for advice? Or how is -- how are all these wealth management solutions going to resonate with them. When you ask that same question, would you be willing to pay for advice, you actually get a number not much lower than what we see from the Schwab Blue side. 31% of Ameritrade clients are willing to pay for advice, and only 2% are currently paying for advice. Now not really that surprising, if you think about Ameritrade's focus was not necessarily in wealth management, some of the capabilities that they had, but when you think about the opportunity as you bring them into the Schwab universe, it's really tremendous. The other thing I'd point out is that we know that likely those 31%, they're actually getting that advice somewhere else. We talked earlier about the share of wallet opportunity. So not only is this an opportunity to engage them in advice, provide them that great experience, but also consolidate those assets that are probably being served somewhere else. So that's a little bit about the retail opportunity, but we also see opportunity on the advisor side, as well as with employers. And let me start with the advisor space. Bernie alluded to this a little bit. And if you think about the RIAs out there, many of them for many years have been looking to outsource more of their back office -- so there's been a trend over time, outsourcing the technology, maybe portfolio management, performance reporting, some of those things that they sell as administrative. But for many years, they were somewhat reluctant to think about outsourcing what they would call maybe their secret sauce, investment selection, portfolio construction, that was something that they wanted to keep closer to home. But what's happened over the last years is actually a change in that dynamic as advisors are realizing that their core value proposition is not necessarily in that part of the value proposition and actually is more about the relationship and all of those wealth services that they can provide outside the portfolio management. There's an increasing trend for advisors to outsource investment management and investment selection, portfolio construction. And what that means for a provider like Schwab is there's an opportunity for us to leverage all the great platform that we have as well as this great capability around asset management, wealth solutions to actually bring those things together so we can actually help serve more of those advisor needs as they continue to move towards -- forward on this trend towards outsourcing. On the right side of the page, what you see is the opportunity in the workplace environment. As we talked about a little bit earlier, workplace is an opportunity where we have more and more employers out there who are looking to serve their employees in a broader way. So think about what the pandemic did. You think about a lot of employers wanting to help their employees not only with their physical health, but also with their financial health, and so employers today they're one of their #1 areas of focus is financial wellness. This was quite different than it was many years ago. But what that results in is employers are more and more looking for providers to provide more help and guidance to their employees. That could look like a financial plan, that could look like a portfolio, but it -- but it is a higher level of service than just managing the portfolio. And this demand is actually not only coming from the employers, but actually the employees themselves. So if you look at the top of this right side, you see that there's demand growing because it is their primary relationship, right? For many people, their 401(k) is their primary service provider. Their primary relationship and financial services is with that 401(k) provider. And so they're looking for more help guidance and often, they're looking for more personalization, too. So as you can see, we look at this wealth and advice opportunity very broadly. There's a great opportunity with retail clients. We have had great opportunity with RIAs as well as with employers and the participants. And what I think is really exciting is that we are really well positioned for this. If you think about what a person looks for in a financial services institution and what Schwab stands for and what we're good at, where our competitive advantages lie, there's a really good match. First of all, trust. Schwab has been recognized as one of the most trusted brands in the industry. And when you think about advice, yes, you want to have a trusted relationship with your financial services provider. But if you're going to take advice from them, that's an elevated level of trust that you're going to need to have. And so our position here as a trusted provider is really important. Secondly, this combination of digital and human -- and I think this is a really interesting area of focus because more and more investors, sometimes driven by the pandemic, but it was a trend that was happening already are seeing the value of both -- the power of both. And I think we've talked about this quite a bit, but when it comes to areas of wealth management, I think we're really just scratching the surface. When you integrate the expertise of humans and bring technology to the back end of that and digital experiences to the front end of that, I think we can do some really powerful things and no firm is better positioned to do that given our strengths than Schwab. The third I would say is value. And I think this is something we all know that Schwab stands for value. This is our -- one of our core competencies, and this is something that we really believe is a principle when it comes to what we deliver to investors and advisors. But if you talk to investors about why don't they get professional advice. So for the investors that are not getting professional advice. The #1 reason, I feel confident in my decisions. Well, great. If they feel confident in their decisions, great Schwab is a great place for them. But the #2 reason is fees and costs. And so we know that there's a population of investors that are out there that want advice that see the need for it, but are may be turned off by the fact that they're not sure if the fees are going to justify that the value that they get. And that is something that we have an incredible strength in doing. And then finally, the one-stop shop. And I kind of look at this in two ways. One is that we know that there's a growing population of investors that are looking for their investing their wealth, their banking all to be in one place. And by the way, this is not only younger investors, we see that same trend in higher net worth individuals. But I think the other part of this is something that Stacy was talking about earlier when we talk about newer investors because what Schwab can do is actually be with an investor throughout their life journey. A lot of firms are going to want to come in and talk to an investor once they're a high net worth investor. And what we have the opportunity to do is actually work with an investor throughout that life journey. When they're a self-directed trader, maybe they don't have a lot of assets, but then they're thinking about stepping into advice, thinking about maybe a nondiscretionary solution, we can be with them across that journey. And I think that's a real powerful differentiator and helps us stand apart. So what are we going to do? So how are we going to go after this opportunity? So let me talk about 3 areas that we're focused on. So first of all, introducing more clients to wealth and advice solutions. And this is -- we talked about this quite a bit already today. But when we think about those millions of TD Ameritrade investors that are out there, that we are going to be bringing on to the Schwab Blue platforms, we have a real opportunity to introduce them to this broad suite of solutions that I shared with you, and we'll be doing that in lots of different ways. Of course, there's digital capabilities that we have. They have welcome experiences, and we talked a little bit about that earlier, but lots of different ways that we can introduce them to these solutions, not to mention all of those green or Ameritrade financial consultants. As we talked about earlier, a lot of those consultants have now been -- they're now duly registered, they're able to talk about these wealth management solutions, but the process is still pretty clunky. They have to actually help their client navigate to the Blue platform, the Schwab platform to actually open that managed investing account. Once we bring them over on to the Schwab Blue platform, all that friction goes away. And the early indications as we work with those financial consultants is really, really exciting. Those are financial consultants who have recognized for years, Ameritrade was a great place for trading, but maybe they weren't quite able to follow through on the rest of the needs that client had. And when they look at that Schwab Blue, that Schwab solution set of wealth and advice solutions, they get very excited about that opportunity to serve their clients in a more holistic way. In the middle column is really around enhancing our offerings, and we have a lot of work to do. We have a great offering, but we have a lot of opportunity to do more. And this is again where traditionally in this industry, when you think about managed accounts, managed investing tends to be a more paper-centric type of experience, tends to be all about the human expertise, and we believe a lot in the human expertise for sure. That is the center. But we also know that we can do a lot around that human expertise to create a better experience. And this really is an area that's very win-win. We know that clients want digital and human experiences. So it's a better client experience. We know that our field, so whether it's a financial consultant, a wealth advisor, a tax in the states attorney. we know that they all are dealing with the same friction in the process, whether it's paper, it's process, it's manual work. And we have the opportunity to really bring a lot of automation to that. And then, of course, it's a win for Schwab because as we scale these processes, we really have an opportunity to bring a lot of efficiency to these different types of offers that we have. As we brought this organization together, one of the obvious opportunities is you have Schwab Wealth Advisory, you have Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, you have Schwab Advisor Network, you have all of these various opportunities -- various offers out there, and we have a lot of opportunity to bring those things together in a much more holistic way for investors. That's really -- we believe, is going to resonate. I'll also touch on the bottom of that middle column around Schwab Wealth Advisory. So Schwab Wealth Advisory is one of our long-standing, we used to call a Schwab Private Client, but rebranded it just about a year ago. Schwab Wealth Advisory is one of our flagship offers. It's a nondiscretionary offer. And if you think about, again, our heritage client, a self-directed client or even an Ameritrade client, a self-directed client, a nondiscretionary offer is a great way for a client to step into advice. They may start a self-directed client and then say, \"I could really use sounding boards, someone to talk to you, someone to give me some advice, but I'm not quite ready to hand over the keys\" this is our great solution for that. And so Schwab Wealth Advisory has grown as a nondiscretionary solution. But what happens off it is, after a client works with Schwab Wealth Advisory for some period of time, one of the most common requests, actually the most common request is, well, can you just now do this for me? Can you just now manage the portfolio? It was great. I got your advice. I trust you. This is working for me. Now could you take this on? And we've never had a discretionary option within Schwab Wealth Advisory. So we are in the process of building that offer. And that will help us be able to serve those clients as they move into that phase of wanting more discretionary management. So again, back to that life journey, you can imagine the client starts out as a self-directed client, they decided to step into advice through maybe a nondiscretionary experience. And then as they become more comfortable, discretionary experience is available for them. So really a great opportunity for us to continue to broaden the way that we serve investors in this space. And then finally, the right side of the slide here talks about expanding our capabilities, and I won't spend much time here so we can get to questions. But Schwab personalizes indexing, we've talked quite a bit about, we'll be introducing new digital capabilities for both retail and RIAs to expand the capabilities there, more personalization capabilities. And I'll touch on Model Market Center, Actually, Bernie just talked about it for a second. But Model Market Center is another great example of a capability that was on the Ameritrade side that we are bringing on to the Schwab Blue platform. And if you think about Model Market Center, it sits on iRebal, but again, back to the outsourcing trend that I showed you for RIAs, it allows us to actually present to advisors, third-party models as well as, by the way, [sesame model], so Charles Schwab Investment management models to advisors so they can actually get more scale in that investment management process. And we're going to continue to invest and improve those capabilities over time. So I hope you walk away from this taking away a few things. One, we have a robust business in wealth and advice, and it's growing quickly. Secondly, we have an even bigger opportunity. If you think about the retail opportunity, the RIA opportunity, and again, we didn't spend too much time on it, but the opportunity we have in the workplace as well. We have these great assets around wealth and device solutions that we can deliver to clients no matter what channel that they're in. And then finally, that we have a lot underway to improve our performance, which has already been quite strong, but improve our position in the future. We really believe that this is an area that we can excel, and we can leverage all of the core competencies of Schwab to do so. So with that, I'm going to pause and see if we have any questions. Yes. As I mentioned, we have very large offering with Schwab Wealth Advisory. And it is a nondiscretionary offering. And the opportunity that we see is actually to introduce discretion to those clients who are asking us for discretion in that offer. And so it is a discretionary offer that will be part of Schwab Wealth Advisory. It's not a new offer. It's not going to have a new brand. But it will be a very robust digital experience, robust capabilities underneath, and it's something that we're going to be building out over the next couple of years. But it is, I think, a real important key element of making sure that we have advice solutions across the spectrum of our clients' needs. Yes, of course. Yes, it's a great point. And I think when we look at that data, we all get very excited and say, well, why aren't these clients coming to us and saying, knocking on the door. I think there's a few reasons for that. One is really awareness. And part of that is we have, of course, all the Ameritrade clients who haven't had access to these. So these products and solutions, so they're just becoming aware. I think the second is that we have -- we've grown pretty tremendously organically as well. So we have lots of Schwab clients who maybe came in as a self-directed client, and didn't even know that, well, Schwab's capabilities around this. So there really is a significant opportunity around just awareness. Our heritage is serving clients directly and being a place for self-directed investors is certainly something that's a strength. But in this area also gives us opportunity because we have the opportunity to tell them about these other things that we do. I think the other thing is we have an opportunity to enhance our offers. And as I mentioned, making some of those offers more digitally capable, adding some more capabilities that will resonate with clients is something that we're focused on doing, and you're going to see a lot more about that over the coming years. And then finally, I think that there's -- when you ask if someone, are you willing to pay for advice, what they might be thinking about advice might be different than what our industry thinks about it as advice. And I think one of the reasons why I think that we are so well positioned at Schwab is that we have lots of different tools in the toolkit and a really great scalable model to be able to deliver that advice in the way that makes sense for the client. So I'll give you an example of this. Traditionally, in our industry, wealth management solutions are delivered with asset-based pricing. One of the things that we did with Schwab Intelligent Portfolios Premium is to create a subscription model. And that allows the client perhaps who wasn't comfortable or didn't like that idea of asset base pricing to engage with us in a different model. You could also imagine that there might be clients who say, \"I'm willing to pay for advice, but I don't want to enroll in something forever. I want advice kind of in moment-in-time, we call moment-in-time advice. And so we have all these experts, all of these capabilities, and our opportunity is to look at that population that is saying they're willing to pay for advice and figure out how is it that we deliver that advice to them in a way that resonates with them. But the wonderful thing is we don't have to go out and prospect a single additional client in order to do that. Of course, we're going to keep growing that engine at Schwab and continue to bring new clients in. But all of that opportunity already exists right within the Schwab House. So I'm going to introduce -- I didn't see you up there. I'm going to bring back, Jeff."

        "speaker8": {
            "name": "Jonathan Craig",
            "content": "Welcome back, everyone. So what I'd like to do over the next 20 minutes is give a quick update on the retail business and, in particular, share some of the 2022 retail accomplishments and then spend the bulk of the time on priorities for 2023 in retail. It's fair to say when you think about priorities for retail in 2023 and beyond, the most significant of which, of course, is to complete the biggest integration in our history and industry history. But at the same time, I want to talk about some other priorities because it is those priorities and those investments that will set us up for the next decade of growth coming out of this integration. Let me just level set with some numbers on that we take out and, of course, the acquisition of Ameritrade has become a business of significant size and scale. We are sitting at $3.2 trillion in retail client assets, almost 25 million brokerage accounts and this year, $176 billion in net new assets. And despite all that growth, we've stuck to a very focused business model. Every single employee in retail, which is to help individual investors and traders achieve great financial outcomes, either directly or through an intermediary. And we do that, of course, by bringing a broad set of capabilities to the table from advice and trading to asset management, financial planning, banking and more. And then we complement those broad capabilities with distinct sets of capabilities for the unique needs of key client segments -- in this business, in 2022, we delivered strong results. I mentioned $176 billion in net new assets, 1.2 million new retail house average trades. And of course, those in-year results are strong, but I think what's more demonstrative of the resilience of the franchise is some of the multiyear trends. Walt shared some earlier as to direct, but just another example, our 3-year compound annual growth rates are 28%, 7% and 55%, respectively, for those core net new assets. Beyond the results, we continue to receive strong industry recognition from folks like Investors Business Daily, J.D. Power, Investopedia and others. And as much as we covet that third-party recognition, what we most aspire 2 or 4 is recognition from clients because they experienced Schwab every day and really pleased to see in retail a Client Promoter Score 65 in 2022. Any market would be strong, but they were, I think, particularly strong in the environment in which they were delivered in an environment that you all know, but an environment where all asset classes, I think, other than cash and commodities were down where investor sentiment hit decade loans. In that environment, it was more important than ever that we be there for our clients. These are critical times to really demonstrate your client centricity when the markets behave like they did in 2022. Being there for your clients means lots of different things, but among other things, it means maybe most importantly, picking up the phone when they call -- across the retail for all clients. This includes our core clients. We picked up the phone with an average of 24 seconds. I think that's an impressive number, I think, industry-leading. And certainly, if you've interacted with other firms outside they agree that, that is demonstrative of being there for our clients in a difficult time. Being there for our clients also means having reliable web and app experiences, which we did throughout the year. It means delivering -- we did that through our thousands of financial consultants through hundreds of thousands of financial plans that were delivered. And then finally, being there for our clients meant delivering insights, ideas and perspectives, both in-the-moment as well as throughout the year. And we do that in multiple channels via the web, via apps, newsletters, client e-mail, of course, social media, podcasts and even our live TD Ameritrade Network. Now it's one thing to produce content, what's more meaningful is whether clients engage with the content and we had record engagement across the board. So really pleased to see how the team stepped up to really be there for our clients. And I think, again, that was probably one of the stronger indications of why our client service level -- our client promotor scores were as high as they were. In addition to delivering strong results and being there, we also -- for our clients, we also made meaningful enhancements to our retail offer in 2022. We relaunched Schwab Wealth Advisory, which formerly was called Schwab Private Client. This is our marquee wealth management solution for retail clients. You're going to hear more about this from Nisha later. We continued our emphasis on personalized investing, I think Rick talked about by launching things like Schwab Personize indexing, Schwab thematic stocklist and we'll continue to do more in both of those areas. -- continue to invest in client service. We added 2,400 new service folks last year as well as invested in a service ecosystem, not the least of which we moved all of our voice telephony platform to more modern, nimble, cloud-based solution. to emphasize and invest in our digital experience we also enhanced our trading capabilities, launching an all-in-one trade ticket as well as making enhancements to thinker swim trading. And then finally, we continue to invest in our relationship models, critically important part of the Schwab retail value proposition. I'll talk more about this, but we assign tens of thousands of more clients to a dedicated relationship, and we continue to integrate, modernize and expand our physical branch network. Last thing I'll say about '22 as you can imagine, we spent a lot of time preparing for this big integration. This big event that's going to happen this year. I could point to a lot of things, but just a couple I'll highlight. Notably, we completed the dual registration of all of our green -- so when I say green, I mean Ameritrade, sorry, Blue Schwab, you didn't catch that. We completed the dual registration of [ALCO] -- and what that means is they're registered with the TDA broker-dealer, but also with the Schwab broker dealer, but as well as with Schwab Bank. And what that means is that they can talk to their clients about they can enroll those clients in those solutions if they make sense and they can get paid on their solutions. You can see on the lower left, that's been already a significant unlock of value. And of course, we're very -- we're just at the beginning. Once they are fully immersed in the Schwab model, I expect a significant opportunity there. We also prepared our service teams and our clients for the conversion. On the service side, we've fully harmonized our service teams. We've harmonized licensing, compensation, training, everything. So it is one service team across Ameritrade and Schwab. And then on the client side, we did everything to harmonize pricing, policies, experiences so that when the Ameritrade client converts from green to blue, the change is minimized. And then finally, critically important synergies. Obviously, a big part of the value creation in this deal is synergies, and we're on track to deliver our synergies, as Joe mentioned. And just one example in my world over $200 million already across both firms without losing any market momentum. So if that's '22, let me talk about 23, really twofold: number one, and again, probably most critically, successfully execute the biggest integration in our history and in industry history. But it goes beyond that. We are also going to make other investments in our corporate priorities of segmentation, monetization and scale. Starting with the integration, Joe mentioned some of this, but the retail part of the integration will happen over 5 -- all 5 transition weekends starting in a couple of weeks in February and then May, September, November and then a very small transition group in early 2024. We are doing everything possible to create a seamless positive client experience for these clients when they go through this significant change. Among other things, we've developed a robust set of client communications and digital experiences so that clients know exactly what to expect, what's coming and what they have to do, which, by the way, is just set up new credentials. It really will be a simple lot to optimize the front line so that the front line is ready for the client calls that are going to come in. We've trained and developed a whole set of transition specialists. We've made significant enhancements to our service desktop, launch new service tools, extensive training that is going on and will continue to go on throughout the year. And then on the client side, we are doing everything we can to close any remaining gaps may not have been able to do it on blue. A perfect example on the blue side and the Schwab side, we will be launching streaming quotes streaming on both web and app. Currently, that's only available on green, on Ameritrade, we're going to bring it to Schwab before the conversion, so that -- so the clients notice that. Another example is we're making final enhancements to money movement. So any money move capabilities that were available on Ameritrade will be similarly available on Schwab when the conversion happens. Lastly, I want to say about the conversion and Joe mentioned this, but this is a novel conversion in that we're not just bringing over the clients' accounts and assets client relationship. That's why it's taken a lot of time. We're bringing over their open orders, their move money instructions, their beneficiaries, their history, their cost basis. The entire relationship is coming over. And I think that's pretty novel to anything we've seen in the industry. And I think that's a big part of why we think it's going to be a seamless experience other than the fact that they'll have a new website and a new app. No matter how well we do, we expect client calls without question, when you drive client change, you get client calls. And we are investing a lot on after the conversion weekends and then for several weeks thereafter. We're pulling multiple levers. Number one, we are doing significant incremental hiring that is onetime expense, onetime hiring, but it's bringing forward hiring so that we have those folks there to take calls. We're leveraging all management levers that we have, things like enhancing over time, ensuring that we're not doing off-phone activities or training on those critical times, holiday blackouts, all the stuff you'd expect. We're leveraging technology even to a greater degree, so things like intelligent assistance, virtual callback, scheduled callback. Now we're leveraging our partners across the firm, the most significant of which is we have thousands of branch personnel on the Schwab side who are licensed. Those Schwab branch personnel are going to be taking phone calls for us during those critical -- after those critical transition weekends. And then finally, we are leveraging some outsourced support from some third parties to help us with some of those low risk, low complexity calls we know we're going to get. So I know we are doing -- I'm confident we're doing everything we can to make the experience seamless to ensure we have the service capacity and to do this conversion with -- in a way that is consistent with our through client size strategy. Beyond integration, the other priority is scale and efficiency. Probably the #1 way to drive scale and efficiency for Schwab from where I'm sitting is to continue to drive outsized organic growth. We are going to do that, which is data-driven marketing, a unique sales and relationship model, the importance of our workplace business and critically important referral. Stacey is going to come up and talk more about each of those. Scale efficiency, though, is also about being easier to do business with. For us, that's about continuing to invest in our multiyear priorities of digitizing more and more and really continuing to transform how we serve clients and how we do relationship management in a way that emphasizes ease. Critically important, when we talk about efficiency at Schwab, it's not about how do we reduce cost to get clients to self-serve. It's how do we deliver clients easier, better experiences. Now when we do that, what often happens is the cost to serve is down. So it is a win-win, but the motivation, the focus -- it may seem like a nuance, but the focus is always about how do we make it easier for our clients to interact with us. Second priority is around what we call win-win or client-centric monetization. Really, this is all about taking the capital that we have with our clients and leveraging that to do more for them, which all with the goal of helping them get better financial outcomes. And what that often leads to is wealth management or bank lending. On the wealth management side, you're going to hear a whole presentation from Nisha on the tremendous opportunity there. But suffice to say, we have a lot of growth opportunity there. On an asset basis across both Schwab and Ameritrade, right about 15% asset penetration deliver wealth management to clients, the TOA ratios go up, the Client Promoter Scores go up, attrition goes down and ultimately, our economics go up. So it really is the definition of a win-win. A lot of our focus there, again, will be on Schwab Wealth Advisory as well as continued efforts in the direct indexing space and other personalized investing opportunities. Bank lending is also a significant opportunity. We've seen a lot of growth, but we have a lot of opportunities, as Rick shared. Much of the focus as it relates to retail there is to continue to enhance our bank lending capabilities, particularly for high net worth and ultra high net worth. We see more and more demand there, and I think we see more and more opportunity to deliver more specialized treatment for those clients. The second priority on bank is around pledged PAL, pledged asset lines, highly sought after credit facility for our retail clients. We see great opportunity there to digitize more and more to reduce cycle times, but also to extend relationship pricing to the PAL offer, which is a core part of how we want to go to market for our clients. Last priority is about segmentation and segmentation starts with a Schwab delivering differentiated relationship models to our clients. We will continue to deliver those models very simply because they work. In fact, when you compare a client who has a relationship, a financial consultant with the client controlling for all other factors that we can control for, you see 2.5x greater NNA, 2.8x improvement in TOA and a 2x improvement in attrition. So in a way that reflects the different needs of our clients, but also the different economics that they deliver to Schwab. We have four primary models to support that. The mass affluent model is a scaled model generally for the sub-$1 million. We have the traditional FC, the local FC of the folks you see largely in branches serve largely the 1 million-plus client at Schwab. For the $10 million plus, we've built an ultra-high net worth specialized model. This is a high-touch model built particularly for ultra net worth -- and then we have specialized financial consultants for active traders, which have always been critically important, but even more important when you think about the integration of the Ameritrade client base. Segmentation relationships are important, but segmentation goes beyond relationships. And we segment across all aspects of the business at Schwab. But historically, that segmentation has been largely behind the scenes by design. That's been a little bit inconsistent and that we might segment in one part of the business, a little bit different than another. We might have different breakpoints. Going forward, we are going to change that. We are going to launch 1 million plus and a $10 million-plus set of branded segments, branded client experiences. These clients already represent more than 2/3 of our client assets, and they also represent the areas where we have the greatest growth -- we want to deliver to ensure we're meeting their unique needs, we want to deliver meaningful segmentation across relationship service or in a entertainment per with the $10 million plus the relationship model will be one of our top financial consultants or a wealth consultant that I referenced earlier. The service model will be served by our most capable, most tenured premier service teams. On the operations side, we've built a bespoke operations model for ultra-high net worth and then, of course, product access, pricing benefits, fee waivers, special client events. There will be a host of other benefits for that client segment. And for the $1 million to $10 million, we will differentiate along those similar dimensions. The one addition is the $10 million private wealth services. We'll be rolling these branded segments out later this year in advance of the green clients who qualify for these segments, converting the Ameritrade clients converting over to Schwab. So that when the Ameritrade clients become Schwab clients, day 1, they will be in Schwab Private Client Services and/or private wealth services depending on their assets. And it's certainly not least critically important is the importance of the trader segment. Trader has always been important to Schwab, but it's gotten even more important with the integration of Ameritrade to eternal last year, almost 40% given the volatility. Our focus on trader is really to solidify this position continue to grow. We believe we're in a really strong position. Once we get thinkers Schwab platform, which will be middle of this year, we'll have the full trading ecosystem at Schwab, defined by powerful downloadable web and app platforms defined by industry-leading specialized service teams, a comprehensive product suite and engaging and thoughtful, I think, industry-leading education as well. I think that's some total -- certainly from where I sit, we are planning to relaunch our trader offer later this year, pretty publicly allowed me in the marketplace. So before I -- before I bring Stacy up, I hope you have a sense of the investments we're making to ensure that this integration goes seamlessly and well and that will happen. And also the investments we're making to set us up for the next decade of growth around segmentation, monetization and scale. I thought I'd just end by where do I think this will position us sort of this time next year, value proposition for self-directed investors, active traders and those seeking advice with premium offers for high net worth and ultra high net worth, all supported by a no trade-offs value proposition, including the industry-only satisfaction guarantee. So a very strong value proposition back by over -- backed by a broader Schwab wide winning approach, an approach that emphasizes client centricity, everything we do is seen through clients' eyes, an approach that emphasizes a singularity of focus, everybody coming to work with one objective, help individual investors achieve great outcomes. A long-term view or willingness to take disruptive moves when it makes sense for the client. And finally, an expense discipline, a commitment to expense discipline, which allows us to continue to bring costs down for investors and feed that virtuous cycle. So a strong value proposition backed by a winning approach. The last thing I'll say, still significant opportunity. We are operating in the retail business in a business that's growing double digits with single-digit, 5% market share. So externally, tremendous opportunity to grow even more opportunity. When you look at our share of wallet, I think Rick shared these numbers as well, tremendous opportunity to grow share of wallet on the Schwab side, even more on the Ameritrade side. When you look at asset advice penetration, banking penetration, utilization of our advanced trading tools, in all those cases, we are in the single digits or low double digits. So a lot of opportunity internally as well. And finally, we have a diversified client and asset acquisition model to go after all that but I hope you have a sense of sort of where my passion comes from where I'm sitting with the strength of where we are today, the strength of where we'll be a year from now and the tremendous opportunity that sits in front of us over the next decade. So let me bring up Stacy to talk about how we're going to go after it all... So I think we're got one already. We'd like to stand. So the chairs were removed. Yes. That's a great question. I think you framed it well. I do think our clients -- any one of us as a consumer, our experiences, our expectations are often set by our best experience. Our last great experience that we had often frames our expectations for every future experience. And I think we in the financial services industry take that to heart, certainly, we at Schwab and recognize that there's opportunity to continue to get easier to do business with, which is why I focused on it so much. I think what's unique about the financial services space is the depth and breadth of what we offer in the serious of what we offer, the regulatory environment around it. So sometimes, some of our best thinkers will come and say, why can't we be like company XYZ and often that company might just rideshare copy. They might just do one thing, the same thing for all folks in a different regulatory world. So my response to that is we need to be as close to that seamless easy experience as possible, but we also need to recognize that we're doing something very different in a much broader way and a much more regulated way. So I would say it's a very high priority for us. It's a high priority for Rick. I know the entire retail leadership team. I think since we're making in digital that we deliver and we'll deliver a great experience, but it's an endless opportunity to do more for sure. You go quick? On bank lending, I'd say. So lending is a significant opportunity, significant priority. Growth has been good in both. Historically, mortgage has been a little bigger than PAL. Obviously, in a different market, I think we see a lot of opportunity in PAL over the next couple of years in mortgage as well. But again, that depends a bit on the interest rate environment. Our financial consultants are fully licensed compensated to talk about lending. Our clients are open to it without question. We market our lending capability. I would say we're all in as it relates to helping our investing clients with the liability side of their balance sheet as much as we can. Okay. So the lending -- the ability to offer lending is very new. The wealth -- the brokerage part of the wealth management part has been throughout, well, 6 months now, at least. So both are very new. They do have access to the full suite of capabilities at Schwab. So the short answer is they have access to the full suite now. Having said that, it takes a while to understand the breadth of what we offer on the wealth management side. It takes a while to understand the banking as Rick mentioned, some of the processes right now since they're still green financial consultants. They're still supporting the TDA client in a TDA environment. It's not quite as seamless when they get over to Schwab. So the short answer is they have full access to everything now to talk to their clients about their Schwab employee, their clients or Schwab clients, it's going to be even easier. Eventually, when they're in a Schwab branch... Yes. Let me share a couple of thoughts from where I said I'm not the expert, but I think I probably represent the broader view generally. I think first and foremost, that Schwab, our focus is and has always been about the individual investor and what's best for the individual investor. And as we look at these market structure proposals, we are looking at them, of course, through that lens. It's early. We have provided some commentary and published a white paper. We have more to digest and we'll share more as the process unfolds. But I think the key thing for us is any change that happens, especially significant change in market structure has to benefit or at least in our mind, should benefit unambiguously the individual investor. If it does, it would make a lot of sense, we would support it. If it doesn't, obviously, we would have a different opinion. From what we've seen so far, I think we have some questions as to whether it really would benefit the individual investor especially relative to how we route orders today, which we have a lot of pride in around best execution. So I guess we'll have more to say as this unfolds. But for us, the lens is what's great for the individual investors, we'll thrive. Our revenue tied to all these proposals is a very small fraction. I think we're -- I would agree, we will go to where the clients are and at the same time, often investing involves a multifaceted conversation tools, relationships in a lot of cases, that eventually leads to coming in a branch or a full show.com experience, but we'll go out to them where they are, and that's all tied to ease. So I think we're at time. I think I'm bringing up our friend and colleague, Bernie."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Schwab\u2019s 2024 Fall Business Update. This is Jeff Edwards, Head of Investor Relations, and I\u2019m joined today by a slightly larger contingent of esteemed presenters, including Co-Chairman and CEO, Walt Bettinger; President, Rick Wurster; new CFO, Mike Verdeschi; and Managing Director, Peter Crawford. Today is certainly a little bittersweet as the team is certainly excited to provide their perspectives about all the exciting things happening at Schwab right now. But, today also marks the final business update for Walt and Peter. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m going too far out on a limb to say that we are all going to miss having both of them in the room with us each quarter, especially Walt, who has helped set the energy and pace for these business updates for well over a decade and a half. I\u2019m certainly going to reach out to Mr. Fowler to see if he\u2019s still planning on hosting quarterly business update watch parties for those former Schwabis who are interested in joining from his undisclosed location. Given the larger group today, we should have a familiar, but slightly different cadence to the session. Walt will kick things off with some opening remarks and then he and Rick, who will be stepping into the CEO role coming January, will provide insights around our clients and overall strategic picture. And, then given the recent CFO transition at the beginning of the month, we thought it made sense to allocate the financial update between Peter, who will focus on 3Q results and Mike, who will touch on our thinking as we enter the final stretch for 2024. And, then this time around, we will save a few extra minutes at the end for some closing remarks from Walt. Some quick housekeeping reminders. The slides for today\u2019s business update will be posted to their usual spot on the IR website at the end of the prepared remarks. Q&A remains structured as the one question, no follow ups, and let\u2019s be mindful of those multi-part questions that we certainly encourage anyone to re-enter the queue if another question comes to mind. And as always, please don\u2019t hesitate to follow-up with IR with any additional questions. And finally, the thread that links us all together through the years, the eternal wall of words regarding our forward-looking statements, reminding us that the future is indeed uncertain, so please stay in touch with our disclosures. And with that, Walt, please start us off.\nWalter W. Bettinger: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our October business update. I\u2019ve had the honor of speaking with all of you at these updates dating back to 2005, when I assumed responsibility for our Investor Services or Retail Business. Of course, as Jeff indicated going forward in my role as Executive Co-Chair, I won\u2019t be participating in these calls. So, I want to take a moment and thank all of you for your interest, your thoughtful questions as well as the insights you shared with me over the years. Through all the ups and downs that changing economic and competitive environments lead to, I\u2019ve always respected your professionalism and integrity. So, thank you. So, let\u2019s go ahead and dive right into our discussion. The third quarter was an important quarter for us during this transition year. Some might refer to it as an inflection point, although only time will tell on that perspective. Nevertheless, Rick, Peter, Mike and I have a series of positive developments to share with you today. In the quarter, we made strong progress across virtually all key areas. Former Ameritrade clients are continuing to generate positive net new assets. That\u2019s the second quarter in a row. Our clients are growing transactional sweep cash balances. We\u2019ve made meaningful progress in paying down supplemental funding. We\u2019re experiencing ongoing strengthening in firm-wide net new assets. Clients are enrolling into our retail advisory solutions at record levels. All these facts, along with other key metrics, illustrate the health of the franchise and fuel our solid optimism for the future. The third quarter did see some choppiness in the markets. Overall, our clients remain solidly engaged, and we continue to make progress on key areas of focus across the firm, which Rick will spend some more time on. I think at this point, any questions about our long-term growth trajectory should seemingly be fading. During the quarter, inflation eased and as the Fed began to lower interest rates, equity markets responded by reaching all-time highs. Investor sentiment remained bullish during the quarter. Overall trading activity was solid, including some modest softening late in the quarter as our traders digested the future of rates as well as an equity market at all-time highs. Client engagement was quite healthy across our full spectrum of capabilities, whether it\u2019d be trading, banking services, advisory solutions, custody for RIAs, as well as asset management. For the quarter, trades were up about 4% from the prior quarter, while margin balances grew over $1 billion to end at $73 billion. Managed investing or retail advisory flows broke another record totaling $15 billion during the third quarter. Net new assets were also quite strong during what is sometimes a slower quarter given that the summer months are included. Net new assets more than doubled from the third quarter of last year, as former Ameritrade clients continued to generate positive, albeit still modest net asset flows. And, during the quarter, clients entrusted us with almost 1 million new brokerage accounts. Slide 9 here is particularly important for those who track our net new assets closely and have been trying to ascertain our progress back to our long-term track record of 5% to 7% organic growth. When we acquired Ameritrade, we recognized that we would be benefiting from a one-time large lift in client assets, but along with it would be the noise of attrition that we estimated at 5% to 6% of assets ultimately applied to nearly a $2 trillion client base. What we saw during the third quarter as more of that attrition faded into the rear view mirror was that year-to-date net new assets for this year crossed over the trajectory of net new assets in 2023. We all know that net new asset levels can be fickle as multiple factors influence them, from investor sentiment to market performance, interest rates and even the level of promotional cash for assets temporarily offered by some competitors. But, when we dig through the various factors that do influence net new assets, we remain quite confident in our plans to build our way back to our historical ranges. This confidence is further supported by the response from former Ameritrade clients. As these clients become more familiar with the Schwab platforms and service experience, we are seeing an increase in client promoter scores or client satisfaction, whether it be retail or RIA clients. Their engagement across the business in our various solutions is further evidence of the success of the integration. And, consistent with our best of both approach to the Ameritrade integration, Legacy Schwab clients are now taking advantage of the thinkorswim trading platform at a robust level. Consistent with prior years, we continue to be recognized by a variety of third-party sources for our quality of services, our overall client offering, as well as our reputation. We were particularly proud of the fact that Investor\u2019s Business Daily named Schwab Bank as the most trusted bank. Given the negative press and at times misperceptions regarding our bank over the past 18 months, we were especially pleased with this particular result. Rick, let me turn it over to you to review some more details of our progress serving clients and building the franchise. And I\u2019ll close this out, as Jeff indicated, after the Q&A session with just a few final observations.\nRick Wurster: Thank you, Walt, and good morning, everyone. Picking up on where Walt left off, we\u2019ve been able to achieve this industry recognition because our through client-size approach remains the foundation of our strategy and it will continue to drive our long-term growth through the cycle. In the near-term, we deliver for clients through our four strategic focus areas. And in the third quarter, we advanced initiatives in each area that you see on the screen. Starting with Scale & Efficiency, we\u2019ve captured 95% of our Ameritrade run rate expense synergies and expect to capture the rest by the end of the year. In an industry where pricing matters to clients, having a low cost position is a huge competitive advantage, one we\u2019re committed to maintaining, with our cost discipline and ongoing investments in our operations and infrastructure, we\u2019re continuing to lower our cost to serve clients. In 2024 to-date, our adjusted expense on client assets or EOCA fell to 12 basis points, down from 16 in 2019. Our second focus area is Win-Win Monetization, which is all about how we attract and retain assets by meeting more of our clients\u2019 evolving financial needs. Wealth Management is one of our key areas of focus and clients continue to turn to us for advice across the spectrum of our solutions. Year-to-date managed investing net flows are up 65% compared to last year. In the third quarter, new and existing clients added $11.5 billion to our full-service wealth offers, which include Schwab Wealth Advisory and Schwab Advisor Network. This is 75% more than the prior year quarter. Clients continue to turn to Schwab Wealth Advisory in record numbers. We also recently began introducing a discretionary option for Schwab Wealth Advisory clients, which will help us meet even more of the comprehensive wealth management needs of investors. Clients continue to have strong interest in our other wealth offerings, including our Wasmer Schroeder fixed income strategies, where year-to-date net flows are up nearly 60% compared to last year. Clients are also increasingly turning to us for their borrowing needs, powering strong growth and adoption of our Pledged Asset Line or PAL. PAL balances reached a record $15.7 billion, an increase of 16% over last year. Notably, former Ameritrade clients represent 44% of PAL balance growth. Our account originations are up 57% year-over-year and we expect if rates fall, the amount drawn on the PAL will increase. The increased adoption is in large part due to the digital enhancements that we\u2019ve made to the process. Nearly 90% of PALs are now digitally originated and more than 40% of retail applications are now initiated by a financial consultant compared to less than 5% just a few years ago. This makes it easier on our clients and helps FC deepen relationships with our clients. The entire process from the time a client opens an application to when they can access their loan takes on average just one and a half business days and only minutes for most loans. This industry leading offer is delighting our clients and client promoter scores have increased roughly 30 percentage points in this product since 2021. With Client Segmentation, we\u2019re focused on serving distinct retail and advisor client groups with tailored solutions specific to their unique needs. RIAs have been and remain in an incredibly important client segment for Schwab. We have the same goal as the RIAs we serve to make a meaningful difference in the financial lives of our clients. And, we are committed to continuing to help our advisors grow, compete and succeed in pursuit of this mission. We have a world-class custody business, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in it to provide RIAs of all sizes with the open architecture platform and unmatched resources, services and education that they have come to expect from us. I\u2019m thrilled to have the opportunity to dive into this in more detail at our upcoming IMPACT Conference next month. Turning to our retail business, we know that relationships matter and we\u2019re investing to give more of our clients access to a dedicated financial consultant. Our ultra-high net worth clients have been a particular area of focus as they have some of the most complex financial planning and wealth management needs among our client base. We\u2019ve added additional expertise for this group, including wealth consultants and tax, trust and estate experts. We\u2019ve also enhanced our approach to service and operations for this client group, all of which has been well received by clients as evidenced by their high-client promoter scores. We plan to launch retail alternatives to this client segment this quarter, which will be an important milestone for clients. Traders are another distinct and very important client segment for us. I believe that the combination of Schwab and Ameritrade has produced the strongest trader offer in the industry. And, we are continuing to enhance our capabilities, including investments in our mobile experience, our platform and our research and education. Our fourth strategic area is the Brilliant Basics. With the size of our client base, the most attractive opportunity we have for growth is to delight our existing clients with every interaction they have with us, so that they trust us with more of their assets, conduct more of their financial lives here at Schwab and refer others to us because we are delivering each day on the client experience. In our retail business, our average speed to answer the phone was less than 40 seconds in the third quarter. Year-to-date through the third quarter, the client easy score for our service teams is 92%. That\u2019s the highest score we\u2019ve earned from clients in four years. And, the vast majority of incoming calls are addressed without the need to transfer the client call. In Advisor Services, our client easy score, which is a client\u2019s real-time rating of how easy it was to complete a specific task or transaction was 89% in the third quarter. And, in our workplace business, we were Ranked #1 by J.D. Power and Participant Satisfaction for our Retirement Plan Digital Experiences. I\u2019m confident in our ability to deliver for clients today and I\u2019m energized by the opportunity to do even more as we look ahead. And, as we look to the future, not just next quarter or next year, but through the cycle and for the long-term through client-size will remain the foundation of our strategy. Through client-size means we will relentlessly focus on serving the needs of individual investors, workplace clients and RIAs and the clients that they serve. True client-size is what will continue to drive the virtuous cycle and fuel our growth well into the future as we invest in the Brilliant Basics, Scale & Efficiency and serving more of our clients\u2019 needs across client segments. I do want to take just a moment here to express my gratitude to Walt for his vision, his leadership, his focus on our clients and the integrity and selflessness in which he has led our company. That vision is not changing as he transitions into his new role as Co-Chairman and I move into my new role as CEO in the New Year. I\u2019m grateful to be stepping into this role in a period when our client capabilities have never been stronger and we are operating from a position of strength. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Peter.\nPeter Crawford: All right. Well, thank you very much, Rick. So, Walt and Rick talked about the strong engagement we\u2019re seeing among our clients as they utilize our broad wealth management and trading capabilities, our success in attracting assets and accounts from both existing and new clients, the encouraging signs we\u2019re seeing that fuel our confidence about returning to our historical growth levels, and our progress and plans to do just that as we execute on our four strategic priorities that Rick talked about. In this, my final time addressing you today and Mike\u2019s inaugural business update, he and I will review our very solid and improving financial performance in the third quarter, which was somewhat better than we expected heading into the quarter. We\u2019ll provide an update on the latest developments regarding our clients\u2019 cash realignment activity and how that enabled us to make progress in paying down bank supplemental borrowing. And, we\u2019ll share an updated outlook for Q4 2024 earnings and some very early thoughts on 2025. The important point is that we near the end of what we have repeatedly called a transitional year. We know we haven\u2019t yet reached our traditional level of organic growth or peak financial performance and yet we feel really good about the progress we have made further unlocking the core earnings power that has been building through this whole cycle, but which has been masked by other factors and reinvigorating our long-term financial formula. With Ameritrade related attrition receding and ceasing to be a major drag on our organic growth, a continued moderation of client cash realignment activity, which allowed for sequential growth in client transactional cash in the third quarter due to strong net inflows during September, sequential growth in both net interest revenue and overall revenue and finally, a steady and continued increase in our capital levels inclusive of AOCI. And, while we all appreciate the uncertain nature of the world we live in, our positive momentum sets the stage for what we expect will be even better operating and financial performance in the quarters and years ahead. As Walt mentioned, 2024 has been characterized by strong equity markets and consistent client engagement. We saw that reflected in external benchmarks such as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ as well as key drivers of our business performance, including margin balances now up 17% from the end of 2023, trading activity in the third quarter that was up modestly from the second quarter, and as Rick mentioned, a continuation of the very strong interest among clients for our advisory solutions. And finally, client cash realignment activity continues to decelerate enabling strong growth in overall client cash and transactional cash for the quarter and especially robust growth in the month of September. Now, while we repeatedly cautioned against overreacting to a specific month\u2019s or even quarter\u2019s transactional cash flows, this recent activity is further evidence that we are at or near truly transactional levels of client cash, enabling us to pay down a meaningful amount of supplemental borrowing at the banks and creating a good launching off point for Q4 as Mike will discuss in a moment. Now, that backdrop helps support solid financial performance in the third quarter that exceeded our expectations with revenue up 5% year-over-year to $4.8 billion. Adjusted pre-tax income up a similar amount and adjusted pre-tax margin of a little over 41% and adjusted EPS of $0.77. Now, before I turn over to Mike, I want to make two brief comments. First, I want to join Walt in thanking all of you within the investment community for your engagement and your interest over these last several years. I firmly believe that the rigor, the discipline and the transparency you demand of us makes us a better company. And second, I want to thank Mike here for allowing me to step down from the CFO role with the confidence that between him and Rick, this company I care so much about is in great hands. It\u2019s really been a real privilege working with Mike these last several months and I\u2019ll continue to do what I can to help over the coming months. He has already added a lot in his time here leveraging his very relevant experience and exceptional judgment. And finally and importantly, he connects with our purpose and his values align with the company\u2019s values. And with that, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the floor over to, Mike.\nMichael Verdeschi: Thank you, Peter, and congratulations on your well-deserved retirement. I\u2019ve certainly enjoyed working with you and the broader management team to get up to speed these past few months. You\u2019ve been an outstanding leader for the firm with many contributions over the years, which have had a positive and lasting impact on our clients and employees. As I mentioned back in May at Investor Day, there are so many exciting things happening around Schwab. So, I feel very fortunate to be stepping into this role right now, and I look forward to working with Rick and the rest of our teams as we continue to serve the needs of our growing client base. Let\u2019s pick it up with a summary of key balance sheet highlights for the quarter. Importantly, we continue to support our clients with both margin and bank loans to clients up sequentially. As Peter alluded to earlier, we saw a healthy rebound in transactional sweep cash during the quarter, including $17 billion of net inflows in September. This positive development in cash enabled us to reduce high cost supplemental funding at the banks by $9 billion. At the same time, we also continued to take proactive steps at the broker dealer to both support sustained client activity in areas such as margin lending and further diversify our funding profile. Those actions included transferring $4 billion of client cash sweep balance to the broker dealer, bringing the total year-to-date transfers to $14 billion. This allows us to align funding where it\u2019s needed to support the large and growing activity of our former Ameritrade clients. We also activated some efficient client related wholesale funding at the broker dealer to again serve the needs of our growing client base, especially those that tend to trade and utilize margin loans more frequently. This wholesale funding has very little impact on our net interest revenue, because the funds we take on are deployed into cash, which earns a fairly similar rate. The net result of these actions is increased flexibility to meet the evolving needs of clients, while continuing to achieve our financial objectives, such as paying down supplemental borrowings at the bank and ensuring growth in earnings. Finally, our capital levels continue to build towards our adjusted Tier 1 Leverage objective, driven by a few factors. First, quarterly earnings, then the accretion of unrealized marks which occurs at a pace of around $1 billion per quarter regardless of changes in interest rates and lastly, an incremental tailwind in Q3 from the move lower in interest rates. Of course, this rate related impact will vary over time based on fluctuations in interest rates across the curve. Turning to client cash trends. The trends in transactional sweep were quite encouraging for the third quarter with total sweep cash balances growing $9 billion, including a $17 billion net inflow during the month of September. This result reflects the continued slowdown of rate related realignment activity. Cash trends during September also benefited from anticipated seasonal trends as well. Moving forward, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that while cash trends do not move in a straight line month-over-month, we anticipate making further progress over time, ultimately resulting in cash balances growing in proportion with client accounts and assets. So, while we will continue to monitor factors that can influence the trajectory of cash, such as interest rates, investor engagement, as well as seasonality, these encouraging trends help support our strategy and momentum into the end of the year. The cash trends also positioned us to make incremental progress on reducing the amount of outstanding supplemental funding at the banks. We reduced the balances by $9 billion from the June 30, 2024 level to just under $65 billion at the end of the third quarter. Supplemental funding balances are now down over 30% from peak levels back in May 2023. Further pay down progress remains a priority as cash as well as principal and interest proceeds from the bank securities portfolio continue to be key drivers in paying down borrowings. The exact timing for achieving our pay down goal will also be influenced by some of the same factors that we see in our transactional cash trends. Over the near-term, continuing to reduce the amount of supplemental funding outstanding is a key driver in achieving normalized earnings power and we expect to show continued progress from here. Turning our attention to capital. Lower rates supported our pace of capital build during the quarter, with our adjusted Tier 1 Leverage ratio expanding by over 70 basis points to 6.7%. We are quickly approaching our 6.75% to 7% operating objective. Despite the recent backup in rates to start the fourth quarter, we still expect to finish 2024 above the lower bound of the objective range. As we begin 2025, we will start to pivot from what has been a focus on building our capital ratios, inclusive of AOCI to looking across our capital framework. As always, our number one priority for capital is to support business growth. To the extent we have excess capital beyond our business needs, we have sought throughout our history to return it to stockholders through a variety of means, including our common dividend, which historically has risen alongside GAAP earnings, preferred security redemptions, considering costs and an optimized equity funding mix, as well as opportunistic stock buybacks. But, as we have previously noted, in the near-term, there is an added consideration relating to our progress on reducing the high cost supplemental funding at the banks. While this action is not a return of capital per se, liquidity, which otherwise could support capital buybacks, may instead be used to pay down supplemental borrowings. Following our third quarter results, we now anticipate full-year 2024 revenue to increase by 2% to 3% versus 2023. This is slightly above the range that was communicated back in July due to a higher starting balance for transactional cash balances and reduced supplemental funding balances at the bank. Adjusted expense growth for full-year 2024 is still expected to be approximately 2%, inclusive of certain non-controllable items outlined earlier in the year. Combining this refresh perspective on topline growth with an expense trajectory that reflects the benefits of our scale and ongoing efficiency initiatives implies earnings expanding further into the upper 80s range for the fourth quarter, a bit above the level we communicated back in July. Before we wrap up, let\u2019s spend a moment on 2025. We are right in the middle of our planning cycle, so we won\u2019t get too far ahead of ourselves, especially with the upcoming presidential election and two FOMC meetings where the rate path remains uncertain. However, we thought it might be helpful to briefly touch on a few items that are helping inform our thinking heading into next year. As noted, we anticipate coming into 2025 with good momentum and expect it to further build in the year ahead with of course the usual considerations for shifts in the macroeconomic backdrop, interest rates, market sentiment, seasonality too. While NIM should continue to expand even in a lower rate environment, the ultimate level will be influenced by a range of factors, including the path of rates, which is now much lower than back in July. On the expense front, consistent with the company\u2019s historical approach, we will balance making investments to support sustainable long-term growth, while also delivering on the firm\u2019s near-term financial objectives. Keeping that balanced approach in mind, year over year expense growth in the mid-single digits still feels like a reasonable starting point for now, while acknowledging that changes in the broader environment, client activity, typical seasonality and other key factors will undoubtedly shape our 2025 expenses. Plenty of opportunity to discuss these topics a few months from now. As we approach the end of 2024, it is hard not to be excited about the opportunity in front of us. Momentum with clients continues to strengthen, while our 3Q financial results put us in a position to deliver meaningful earnings power expansion. As the combination of our diversified revenue model and a balanced approach to expense management yields profitable growth, which we believe will be amplified by our capital efficiency through the cycle. And with that, it\u2019s time for some Q&A. Jeff, back to you.\nJeff Edwards: Operator, can you please help outline the Q&A process for the group?\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ken Worthington from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nKen Worthington: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. You reported a substantial improvement in transactional sweep cash and deposits this quarter. I would love to better understand what drove this change in September, compared particularly to August in earlier quarter levels. Given September NNA was similar in September to August levels and given the Ameritrade flows are positive but still modest and we\u2019re seeing fund and ETF buying similar again in September to August levels. What is really driving, the better or what really drove the better transactional cash in September? And is this the beginning of a better outlook or is September really just a one-off?\nMichael Verdeschi: Let me address that with talking about the quarter. In the quarter, we did see organic growth of cash. And I would say, we also saw some of the variability that we typically see in client activity as they engage us. So, as you highlight, we did see that pick up in September. But over the course of the quarter, as we\u2019ve been saying, this is further evidence of that realignment activity normalizing. So, a combination of organic growth and some of that variability as well. So, we feel good about this progress. And again, this is going to be one of the keys in addition to obviously taking on the principal and interest payments that come out of the securities portfolio in combination using those proceeds to make further progress on paying down the supplemental borrowings.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlexander Blostein: Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for the question and congrats to you all on your next respective chapters. I wanted to ask Mike just your thoughts around how you\u2019re thinking about the securities portfolio given the fact that the cash seems to be stabilizing a bit and the capital is rebuilding. That\u2019s come up a number of times in the past as well. But obviously financially paying down securities a bit ahead of schedule to reduce EBITDA balances makes sense. But curious how you\u2019re thinking about any kind of holistic securities portfolio restructuring as you enter \u201825?\nMichael Verdeschi: Sure. Well, that remains certainly a popular topic within the investment community and we appreciate that question, but it is something that we\u2019re not currently pursuing. And as we\u2019ve said in the past, we do not want to create unnecessarily headline risk that could disrupt our trusted relationship with clients. And I think an important factor that we\u2019re looking at is again that ability to continue to make progress in paying down that supplemental funding at the bank. And so we do have an analysis. We keep that analysis fresh of looking at what a restructuring could entail. But for the reasons that I mentioned, not at this time. And the key factor that we\u2019re focused on is the progress of paying down that supplemental funding.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Mike, I believe you said mid-single-digit expense growth was an early expectation for 2025. Just wanted to clarify, would that be before the averaging in of the efficiencies that were realized through the year in 2024? And would it exclude onetime items such as the FDIC and other charges in 2024?\nMichael Verdeschi: Sure. So that does that is inclusive of that restructuring from this year. So again, that mid-single digit is going to reflect really our intent to ensure we have resources made available to continue to invest in our capabilities. We are a growth company, so that is going to be important that we have sustainable investment in our firm, while at the same time, we\u2019re going to be demonstrating discipline in that expense deployment, ensuring that we\u2019re meeting our financial objectives. So, it does include those components.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. Question on organic growth, which those trends continue to improve, but it does seem like Ameritrade clients continue to be somewhat of a drag. Can you talk about how you see that normalizing or when you see that normalizing? And then also update us on the backlog currently for new advisors potentially joining the platform?\nRick Wurster: Sure. Let me start with our organic growth. So overall, when we look at our Schwab only clients or legacy clients of Schwab, the growth of our legacy Schwab clients remains in that 5% to 7% growth range that we historically have seen. As it relates to Ameritrade clients, we\u2019re going through what is a natural process of Ameritrade clients coming to Schwab, joining our platform and realizing how much they love it. Our flows from Ameritrade clients have outperformed our expectations. Walt shared earlier the expected level of attrition that we thought we would see. We\u2019ve seen less than that. We\u2019ve outperformed that. And for two quarters in a row, we\u2019ve begun to see former Ameritrade clients contribute positively to net new assets. So, our expectation is that over time as those clients become more familiar with our platform, get comfortable with it as we build a relationship with those clients because I think that\u2019s a big difference between some of what they would have experienced at Ameritrade and what they\u2019re experiencing now as part of Schwab is the relationship element of what we do, the service part of what we do. As they get to experience that, we believe they will contribute more net new assets over time and grow into the level that we see from our Schwab clients. So, we do expect that our long-term growth trajectory will continue. We expect our Ameritrade clients to continue to grow their net new assets at the firm as they\u2019ve done the last 2 quarters. And importantly, all signs that we\u2019re seeing with our Ameritrade clients suggest that our relationship model is working. And if you look at our record flows into our wealth area, a significant portion over a third of the flows are coming from former Ameritrade clients. And if you look at our lending capabilities, half of new originations in our pledged asset line, half of the growth came from former Ameritrade clients. So, the push to put our arms around these Ameritrade clients, help them in their financial life just as we\u2019ve done for Schwab clients is working and our expectation is that you\u2019ll see over the long-term our growth in the range that you\u2019ve seen it at Schwab.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt from KBW. Please go ahead.\nKyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. So, you seem to be on-track to be at the high end or even above your tier one leverage target by year-end. However, you reiterated this quarter that you want to make more progress on the repayment of supplemental borrowing before restarting share repurchases. I\u2019m just wondering if you could provide more color as to whether there\u2019s a certain level of supplemental borrowing at which you feel comfortable executing on buybacks or if there\u2019s a certain level of tier one leverage above your target where you would be comfortable executing on buybacks even without substantially making more progress on repayment of supplemental borrowings.\nMichael Verdeschi: So, just to reiterate and thank you for the question. Paying down supplemental borrowings is a very high priority. Obviously, we\u2019ve had some good progress this quarter. We want to continue to make that progress. And we really want to get those levels down much more meaningfully, really get it down to that more permanent level, which is going to be modest at very most. So, we have more work to do there. We\u2019re certainly encouraged by the cash trends that we\u2019ve seen, which will be an important driver of that pay down of supplemental borrowings. So, we need to continue to see that sustained progress. I wouldn\u2019t say there is an exact amount in mind. It\u2019s going to be a function of the broader environment as well. And yes, we\u2019ve made good progress on the growth of that capital as you alluded to. And that has been a combination of the earnings growth that we\u2019ve seen, so that organic growth. You also have that accretion component as well from the securities portfolio. And this quarter, you did see some increase due to the variability in interest rates and that\u2019s a component, keep in mind, that will continue to play out over time. But it then gets back to our capital framework. To the extent we have capital over and above what\u2019s needed to support our firm. And I want to make that point very clear. The capital that we have is there to support our firm and to grow our strategy. Beyond that and beyond paying down supplemental borrowings, then we look to our capital framework where we will look at an opportunity to return capital to shareholders. And that could come in a variety of forms. It could be through common dividends, where historically we\u2019ve been at 20% to 30% of GAAP earnings. But we\u2019ll also look at preferred securities outstanding and look to see when they are callable and make a decision whether that capital is needed and whether we wish to call them or not. And then beyond that, we would look to buybacks. So, I think the when I think about capital, we\u2019re going to continue to ensure that the capital is available for our growth. We have this different consideration this time around with paying down supplemental borrowings. And then beyond that, we\u2019ll look to our capital framework.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteven Chubak: Hey, good morning. So first off, congrats Walt and Peter, thank you for insights over the years. Mike, I did want to ask you on the funding strategy, you touched a bit in your prepared remarks, but was hoping you could just speak to changes to your funding approach. Just trying to understand whether there\u2019s a funding arbitrage from raising wholesale borrowings at the broker dealer versus the bank. And just help quantify the increase in borrowings at the broker dealer. Just trying to get a better or more holistic funding picture, if you will, across the firm given there seem to be some different moving pieces at the bank versus the broker dealer here.\nMichael Verdeschi: Hi, Steven. Thank you for the question. So that funding at the broker dealer is certainly an efficient source of funds and it is important that we diversify our sources of funding. That is just a general practice that we want to have here. It\u2019s a capability we want to have. And it\u2019s efficient in that I would think of it as pre-positioning funding that we then subsequently placing in cash and earning a roughly equivalent yield. That is very efficient and it gives us the flexibility to meet the evolving needs of our clients. In the broker dealer with the completion of the Ameritrade acquisition, we have a growing client base. We have a client base that\u2019s dynamic and how they engage us through margin lending. And that type of broker dealer funding is very efficient in meeting that evolving need and it allows us to also achieve the financial outcomes that we want to achieve, which is that growth of earnings that we\u2019re focused on as well. I think more broadly, when I think about funding across the firm, I talk about diversified sources of funding and that\u2019s the bank as well as the non-bank, the broker dealer and that could be in a variety of forms. It could be secured and unsecured and short-term and long-term programs. So, it\u2019s really about creating a construct and having a framework that allows us to have flexibility to meet our client needs, while at the same time ensuring that we\u2019re driving financial outcomes as well.\nOperator: Thank you. For the next question, we\u2019ll go to Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning. And also congrats to Walt, Peter and Rick and welcome Mike. My question just goes back to the deposits. Obviously, fantastic result for September. I guess and I know month to month can be noisy of course, but do you expect some reversion of that, i.e., some deployment of that surge in deposits as we sort of move into October? And then similarly that growth over the long-term that you outlined, Mike, is that do you think we\u2019ll be able to still exit 2025 with a NIM of 3% given the forward curve or is that simply just lower, and do you have a view of what that might be given the lower forward curve?\nWalter W. Bettinger: Thanks, Brian. Let me address the cash part again. I know Mike\u2019s already addressed it, but let me just make a quick comment there and I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike to talk about the NIM. We have cautioned for a long time an excessive focus on monthly cash movements, because you can simply have a one day difference making a huge impact in a monthly number depending on when fixed income maturities mature. Although the numbers are big, if you look at these numbers as a percentage of a $10 trillion client base, they are actually quite modest. And so the right way to look at it is at a quarter, not at a month. And we feel very good about where we ended up for the quarter. I don\u2019t think there is anything unique or one off in the results for the quarter. And that\u2019s why we feel confident about the fact that we continue to make progress in building of our balance sheet cash and anticipate that as we move forward taking into account the seasonality that Mike previously referenced. Mike, let me turn it over to you for NIM.\nMichael Verdeschi: Thank you, Walt. And sure, there\u2019s been a lot of focus on NIM. And that previous outlook of NIM approaching 3% by the end of 2025, that endpoint, December \u201825, if you will, that was informed by a rate path from earlier in the year that was much higher than the rate path that we see in, say, today\u2019s dot plot. So, it\u2019s reasonable to expect with that much lower expected rate trajectory for NIM to be modestly below that approaching 3% level that we talked about for the end of 2025. But what\u2019s important to convey is that even in that lower expectation for rates, that we expect to continue to expand net interest margin in 2025. And a key driver of that is going to be our confidence in making that sustained progress in reducing that high cost supplemental funding at the bank. And so, what we\u2019re talking about for fourth quarter is NIM into the well into the 220s and importantly, further meaningful expansion in 2025 as well. Now, we\u2019ll be back in January as we typically do with the financial scenario at that time. Between now and then, we have two more FOMC meetings, where the outcome of those meetings still remains uncertain in terms of their decisioning. So we\u2019ll have more information between now and January when we\u2019ll come back to you and talk more about NIM at that time.\nJeff Edwards: Great. Thanks. Operator, I think we have time for one final question.\nOperator: And for our last question, we\u2019ll go to the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about the REA custody business. Curious how you\u2019re thinking about opportunities for expanding your offering and solutions over time for the REA custody side? And what opportunities might be there to enhance monetization, I know historically you have not charged a custody fee and what sort of scenario could that make sense? Thanks.\nWalter W. Bettinger: Thanks for the question, Michael. Let me talk a little bit about our, Advisor Services business and start by just saying it\u2019s been a growth powerhouse for us. It continues to drive really strong net new asset formation, both in terms of the RIAs coming onto our platform and the growth of the RIAs for whom we custody assets. As we look at monetizing the business, I think there\u2019s lots of opportunity in the future. We have been trying to do more in wealth, asset management and lending to support our advisors. And you certainly see it, our growth in all three of those areas as evidenced by some of the numbers we shared earlier. RIAs have been asking us, almost begging for us to lend to them and their clients over time because they want to work directly with us and they don\u2019t want to introduce another party into the relationship. And as we\u2019ve upped our game with our pledged asset line capability and some of our mortgage capabilities, more and more clients are keeping their lending business with us and we expect that as rates fall, we\u2019ll see that accelerate. We\u2019re also seeing on the wealth and the asset management side where our RIAs rely upon us in a number of different ways, including our fixed income capabilities, our Schwab personalized indexing capabilities, and a number of other areas. I also think that there\u2019s more we can do for RIAs over time. If you think about the value chain around the RIAs, there are a number of ways in which RIAs spend money in their business. And many of those ways are services that we could potentially provide and for which the RIA would prefer to work with us because it would make their life easier. Those are all areas that we are exploring. As it relates to custody fee, we have we believe our current model works and has served the test of time. We have asked RIAs if they would prefer a custody fee in lieu of or taking a different approach. And that has not been a popular idea when we\u2019ve offered that to RIAs. So, we like our current model. We do think there\u2019s lots of ways to monetize our position with RIAs and we expect to do that over time in a way that is client friendly and helps us build our business and helps the RA build their business most importantly.\nWalter W. Bettinger: Well, thanks all for dialing in and participating in our call today. As I mentioned in my opening thoughts, I\u2019ve had the honor and the privilege to speak with many of you about Schwab\u2019s results for almost 20 years. During that time, I have learned so much from the thoughtful and seasoned analysts who cover our stock as well as the owners who I would regularly meet with. So, thank you. And as I make this transition from CEO to Executive Co-Chair, I\u2019m especially grateful to the tens of thousands of Schwabis and the millions of clients who have helped us grow during my tenure, not only from an $18 billion market cap company to something around $125 billion but also quadruple our stock price. I realize that these numbers are the lenses that many will choose to look through to evaluate my time as CEO of Schwab. But if I could, I\u2019d like to go back to the very first conversation that Chuck Schwab had with me about the possibility of being CEO of the company someday. This conversation actually happened several years before I formally became CEO. And during that conversation, I asked Chuck this question, if I do become CEO someday, what would be the most important objective that you would like me to achieve during my time as CEO? Now I fully expected Chuck to reply with maybe a certain level of client assets or client accounts, maybe a level of market capitalization or even the stock price. But for those of you who know Chuck well, you can probably suspect that his answer was none of those. Instead, Chuck shared that his definition of success would be if I did my part during my tenure to ensure that there would be a strong independent Schwab 50 years hence. Importantly, because in Chuck\u2019s words, investors need and deserve what we offer them. First rate service, great value, quality execution, professional advice, low cost mutual funds and ETFs, access independent investment advisors and so much more. And thanks to our employees, our 43 million clients and our long-term stockholders, Chuck has personally shared with me mission accomplished. Thank you all so much for joining us on our call today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Crawford",
            "content": "All right. Well, thank you very much, Rick. So, Walt and Rick talked about the strong engagement we're seeing among our clients as they utilize our broad wealth management and trading capabilities, our success in attracting assets and accounts from both existing and new clients, the encouraging signs we're seeing that fuel our confidence about returning to our historical growth levels, and our progress and plans to do just that as we execute on our four strategic priorities that Rick talked about. In this, my final time addressing you today and Mike's inaugural business update, he and I will review our very solid and improving financial performance in the third quarter, which was somewhat better than we expected heading into the quarter. We'll provide an update on the latest developments regarding our clients' cash realignment activity and how that enabled us to make progress in paying down bank supplemental borrowing. And, we'll share an updated outlook for Q4 2024 earnings and some very early thoughts on 2025. The important point is that we near the end of what we have repeatedly called a transitional year. We know we haven't yet reached our traditional level of organic growth or peak financial performance and yet we feel really good about the progress we have made further unlocking the core earnings power that has been building through this whole cycle, but which has been masked by other factors and reinvigorating our long-term financial formula. With Ameritrade related attrition receding and ceasing to be a major drag on our organic growth, a continued moderation of client cash realignment activity, which allowed for sequential growth in client transactional cash in the third quarter due to strong net inflows during September, sequential growth in both net interest revenue and overall revenue and finally, a steady and continued increase in our capital levels inclusive of AOCI. And, while we all appreciate the uncertain nature of the world we live in, our positive momentum sets the stage for what we expect will be even better operating and financial performance in the quarters and years ahead. As Walt mentioned, 2024 has been characterized by strong equity markets and consistent client engagement. We saw that reflected in external benchmarks such as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ as well as key drivers of our business performance, including margin balances now up 17% from the end of 2023, trading activity in the third quarter that was up modestly from the second quarter, and as Rick mentioned, a continuation of the very strong interest among clients for our advisory solutions. And finally, client cash realignment activity continues to decelerate enabling strong growth in overall client cash and transactional cash for the quarter and especially robust growth in the month of September. Now, while we repeatedly cautioned against overreacting to a specific month's or even quarter's transactional cash flows, this recent activity is further evidence that we are at or near truly transactional levels of client cash, enabling us to pay down a meaningful amount of supplemental borrowing at the banks and creating a good launching off point for Q4 as Mike will discuss in a moment. Now, that backdrop helps support solid financial performance in the third quarter that exceeded our expectations with revenue up 5% year-over-year to $4.8 billion. Adjusted pre-tax income up a similar amount and adjusted pre-tax margin of a little over 41% and adjusted EPS of $0.77. Now, before I turn over to Mike, I want to make two brief comments. First, I want to join Walt in thanking all of you within the investment community for your engagement and your interest over these last several years. I firmly believe that the rigor, the discipline and the transparency you demand of us makes us a better company. And second, I want to thank Mike here for allowing me to step down from the CFO role with the confidence that between him and Rick, this company I care so much about is in great hands. It's really been a real privilege working with Mike these last several months and I'll continue to do what I can to help over the coming months. He has already added a lot in his time here leveraging his very relevant experience and exceptional judgment. And finally and importantly, he connects with our purpose and his values align with the company's values. And with that, it's my pleasure to turn the floor over to, Mike."
        },
        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Michael Verdeschi",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and congratulations on your well-deserved retirement. I've certainly enjoyed working with you and the broader management team to get up to speed these past few months. You've been an outstanding leader for the firm with many contributions over the years, which have had a positive and lasting impact on our clients and employees. As I mentioned back in May at Investor Day, there are so many exciting things happening around Schwab. So, I feel very fortunate to be stepping into this role right now, and I look forward to working with Rick and the rest of our teams as we continue to serve the needs of our growing client base. Let's pick it up with a summary of key balance sheet highlights for the quarter. Importantly, we continue to support our clients with both margin and bank loans to clients up sequentially. As Peter alluded to earlier, we saw a healthy rebound in transactional sweep cash during the quarter, including $17 billion of net inflows in September. This positive development in cash enabled us to reduce high cost supplemental funding at the banks by $9 billion. At the same time, we also continued to take proactive steps at the broker dealer to both support sustained client activity in areas such as margin lending and further diversify our funding profile. Those actions included transferring $4 billion of client cash sweep balance to the broker dealer, bringing the total year-to-date transfers to $14 billion. This allows us to align funding where it's needed to support the large and growing activity of our former Ameritrade clients. We also activated some efficient client related wholesale funding at the broker dealer to again serve the needs of our growing client base, especially those that tend to trade and utilize margin loans more frequently. This wholesale funding has very little impact on our net interest revenue, because the funds we take on are deployed into cash, which earns a fairly similar rate. The net result of these actions is increased flexibility to meet the evolving needs of clients, while continuing to achieve our financial objectives, such as paying down supplemental borrowings at the bank and ensuring growth in earnings. Finally, our capital levels continue to build towards our adjusted Tier 1 Leverage objective, driven by a few factors. First, quarterly earnings, then the accretion of unrealized marks which occurs at a pace of around $1 billion per quarter regardless of changes in interest rates and lastly, an incremental tailwind in Q3 from the move lower in interest rates. Of course, this rate related impact will vary over time based on fluctuations in interest rates across the curve. Turning to client cash trends. The trends in transactional sweep were quite encouraging for the third quarter with total sweep cash balances growing $9 billion, including a $17 billion net inflow during the month of September. This result reflects the continued slowdown of rate related realignment activity. Cash trends during September also benefited from anticipated seasonal trends as well. Moving forward, it's important to keep in mind that while cash trends do not move in a straight line month-over-month, we anticipate making further progress over time, ultimately resulting in cash balances growing in proportion with client accounts and assets. So, while we will continue to monitor factors that can influence the trajectory of cash, such as interest rates, investor engagement, as well as seasonality, these encouraging trends help support our strategy and momentum into the end of the year. The cash trends also positioned us to make incremental progress on reducing the amount of outstanding supplemental funding at the banks. We reduced the balances by $9 billion from the June 30, 2024 level to just under $65 billion at the end of the third quarter. Supplemental funding balances are now down over 30% from peak levels back in May 2023. Further pay down progress remains a priority as cash as well as principal and interest proceeds from the bank securities portfolio continue to be key drivers in paying down borrowings. The exact timing for achieving our pay down goal will also be influenced by some of the same factors that we see in our transactional cash trends. Over the near-term, continuing to reduce the amount of supplemental funding outstanding is a key driver in achieving normalized earnings power and we expect to show continued progress from here. Turning our attention to capital. Lower rates supported our pace of capital build during the quarter, with our adjusted Tier 1 Leverage ratio expanding by over 70 basis points to 6.7%. We are quickly approaching our 6.75% to 7% operating objective. Despite the recent backup in rates to start the fourth quarter, we still expect to finish 2024 above the lower bound of the objective range. As we begin 2025, we will start to pivot from what has been a focus on building our capital ratios, inclusive of AOCI to looking across our capital framework. As always, our number one priority for capital is to support business growth. To the extent we have excess capital beyond our business needs, we have sought throughout our history to return it to stockholders through a variety of means, including our common dividend, which historically has risen alongside GAAP earnings, preferred security redemptions, considering costs and an optimized equity funding mix, as well as opportunistic stock buybacks. But, as we have previously noted, in the near-term, there is an added consideration relating to our progress on reducing the high cost supplemental funding at the banks. While this action is not a return of capital per se, liquidity, which otherwise could support capital buybacks, may instead be used to pay down supplemental borrowings. Following our third quarter results, we now anticipate full-year 2024 revenue to increase by 2% to 3% versus 2023. This is slightly above the range that was communicated back in July due to a higher starting balance for transactional cash balances and reduced supplemental funding balances at the bank. Adjusted expense growth for full-year 2024 is still expected to be approximately 2%, inclusive of certain non-controllable items outlined earlier in the year. Combining this refresh perspective on topline growth with an expense trajectory that reflects the benefits of our scale and ongoing efficiency initiatives implies earnings expanding further into the upper 80s range for the fourth quarter, a bit above the level we communicated back in July. Before we wrap up, let's spend a moment on 2025. We are right in the middle of our planning cycle, so we won't get too far ahead of ourselves, especially with the upcoming presidential election and two FOMC meetings where the rate path remains uncertain. However, we thought it might be helpful to briefly touch on a few items that are helping inform our thinking heading into next year. As noted, we anticipate coming into 2025 with good momentum and expect it to further build in the year ahead with of course the usual considerations for shifts in the macroeconomic backdrop, interest rates, market sentiment, seasonality too. While NIM should continue to expand even in a lower rate environment, the ultimate level will be influenced by a range of factors, including the path of rates, which is now much lower than back in July. On the expense front, consistent with the company's historical approach, we will balance making investments to support sustainable long-term growth, while also delivering on the firm's near-term financial objectives. Keeping that balanced approach in mind, year over year expense growth in the mid-single digits still feels like a reasonable starting point for now, while acknowledging that changes in the broader environment, client activity, typical seasonality and other key factors will undoubtedly shape our 2025 expenses. Plenty of opportunity to discuss these topics a few months from now. As we approach the end of 2024, it is hard not to be excited about the opportunity in front of us. Momentum with clients continues to strengthen, while our 3Q financial results put us in a position to deliver meaningful earnings power expansion. As the combination of our diversified revenue model and a balanced approach to expense management yields profitable growth, which we believe will be amplified by our capital efficiency through the cycle. And with that, it's time for some Q&A. Jeff, back to you. Let me address that with talking about the quarter. In the quarter, we did see organic growth of cash. And I would say, we also saw some of the variability that we typically see in client activity as they engage us. So, as you highlight, we did see that pick up in September. But over the course of the quarter, as we've been saying, this is further evidence of that realignment activity normalizing. So, a combination of organic growth and some of that variability as well. So, we feel good about this progress. And again, this is going to be one of the keys in addition to obviously taking on the principal and interest payments that come out of the securities portfolio in combination using those proceeds to make further progress on paying down the supplemental borrowings. Sure. Well, that remains certainly a popular topic within the investment community and we appreciate that question, but it is something that we're not currently pursuing. And as we've said in the past, we do not want to create unnecessarily headline risk that could disrupt our trusted relationship with clients. And I think an important factor that we're looking at is again that ability to continue to make progress in paying down that supplemental funding at the bank. And so we do have an analysis. We keep that analysis fresh of looking at what a restructuring could entail. But for the reasons that I mentioned, not at this time. And the key factor that we're focused on is the progress of paying down that supplemental funding. Sure. So that does that is inclusive of that restructuring from this year. So again, that mid-single digit is going to reflect really our intent to ensure we have resources made available to continue to invest in our capabilities. We are a growth company, so that is going to be important that we have sustainable investment in our firm, while at the same time, we're going to be demonstrating discipline in that expense deployment, ensuring that we're meeting our financial objectives. So, it does include those components. So, just to reiterate and thank you for the question. Paying down supplemental borrowings is a very high priority. Obviously, we've had some good progress this quarter. We want to continue to make that progress. And we really want to get those levels down much more meaningfully, really get it down to that more permanent level, which is going to be modest at very most. So, we have more work to do there. We're certainly encouraged by the cash trends that we've seen, which will be an important driver of that pay down of supplemental borrowings. So, we need to continue to see that sustained progress. I wouldn't say there is an exact amount in mind. It's going to be a function of the broader environment as well. And yes, we've made good progress on the growth of that capital as you alluded to. And that has been a combination of the earnings growth that we've seen, so that organic growth. You also have that accretion component as well from the securities portfolio. And this quarter, you did see some increase due to the variability in interest rates and that's a component, keep in mind, that will continue to play out over time. But it then gets back to our capital framework. To the extent we have capital over and above what's needed to support our firm. And I want to make that point very clear. The capital that we have is there to support our firm and to grow our strategy. Beyond that and beyond paying down supplemental borrowings, then we look to our capital framework where we will look at an opportunity to return capital to shareholders. And that could come in a variety of forms. It could be through common dividends, where historically we've been at 20% to 30% of GAAP earnings. But we'll also look at preferred securities outstanding and look to see when they are callable and make a decision whether that capital is needed and whether we wish to call them or not. And then beyond that, we would look to buybacks. So, I think the when I think about capital, we're going to continue to ensure that the capital is available for our growth. We have this different consideration this time around with paying down supplemental borrowings. And then beyond that, we'll look to our capital framework. Hi, Steven. Thank you for the question. So that funding at the broker dealer is certainly an efficient source of funds and it is important that we diversify our sources of funding. That is just a general practice that we want to have here. It's a capability we want to have. And it's efficient in that I would think of it as pre-positioning funding that we then subsequently placing in cash and earning a roughly equivalent yield. That is very efficient and it gives us the flexibility to meet the evolving needs of our clients. In the broker dealer with the completion of the Ameritrade acquisition, we have a growing client base. We have a client base that's dynamic and how they engage us through margin lending. And that type of broker dealer funding is very efficient in meeting that evolving need and it allows us to also achieve the financial outcomes that we want to achieve, which is that growth of earnings that we're focused on as well. I think more broadly, when I think about funding across the firm, I talk about diversified sources of funding and that's the bank as well as the non-bank, the broker dealer and that could be in a variety of forms. It could be secured and unsecured and short-term and long-term programs. So, it's really about creating a construct and having a framework that allows us to have flexibility to meet our client needs, while at the same time ensuring that we're driving financial outcomes as well. Thank you, Walt. And sure, there's been a lot of focus on NIM. And that previous outlook of NIM approaching 3% by the end of 2025, that endpoint, December \u201825, if you will, that was informed by a rate path from earlier in the year that was much higher than the rate path that we see in, say, today's dot plot. So, it's reasonable to expect with that much lower expected rate trajectory for NIM to be modestly below that approaching 3% level that we talked about for the end of 2025. But what's important to convey is that even in that lower expectation for rates, that we expect to continue to expand net interest margin in 2025. And a key driver of that is going to be our confidence in making that sustained progress in reducing that high cost supplemental funding at the bank. And so, what we're talking about for fourth quarter is NIM into the well into the 220s and importantly, further meaningful expansion in 2025 as well. Now, we'll be back in January as we typically do with the financial scenario at that time. Between now and then, we have two more FOMC meetings, where the outcome of those meetings still remains uncertain in terms of their decisioning. So we'll have more information between now and January when we'll come back to you and talk more about NIM at that time."

            "content": "Thank you, Walt, and good morning, everyone. Picking up on where Walt left off, we've been able to achieve this industry recognition because our through client-size approach remains the foundation of our strategy and it will continue to drive our long-term growth through the cycle. In the near-term, we deliver for clients through our four strategic focus areas. And in the third quarter, we advanced initiatives in each area that you see on the screen. Starting with Scale & Efficiency, we've captured 95% of our Ameritrade run rate expense synergies and expect to capture the rest by the end of the year. In an industry where pricing matters to clients, having a low cost position is a huge competitive advantage, one we're committed to maintaining, with our cost discipline and ongoing investments in our operations and infrastructure, we're continuing to lower our cost to serve clients. In 2024 to-date, our adjusted expense on client assets or EOCA fell to 12 basis points, down from 16 in 2019. Our second focus area is Win-Win Monetization, which is all about how we attract and retain assets by meeting more of our clients' evolving financial needs. Wealth Management is one of our key areas of focus and clients continue to turn to us for advice across the spectrum of our solutions. Year-to-date managed investing net flows are up 65% compared to last year. In the third quarter, new and existing clients added $11.5 billion to our full-service wealth offers, which include Schwab Wealth Advisory and Schwab Advisor Network. This is 75% more than the prior year quarter. Clients continue to turn to Schwab Wealth Advisory in record numbers. We also recently began introducing a discretionary option for Schwab Wealth Advisory clients, which will help us meet even more of the comprehensive wealth management needs of investors. Clients continue to have strong interest in our other wealth offerings, including our Wasmer Schroeder fixed income strategies, where year-to-date net flows are up nearly 60% compared to last year. Clients are also increasingly turning to us for their borrowing needs, powering strong growth and adoption of our Pledged Asset Line or PAL. PAL balances reached a record $15.7 billion, an increase of 16% over last year. Notably, former Ameritrade clients represent 44% of PAL balance growth. Our account originations are up 57% year-over-year and we expect if rates fall, the amount drawn on the PAL will increase. The increased adoption is in large part due to the digital enhancements that we've made to the process. Nearly 90% of PALs are now digitally originated and more than 40% of retail applications are now initiated by a financial consultant compared to less than 5% just a few years ago. This makes it easier on our clients and helps FC deepen relationships with our clients. The entire process from the time a client opens an application to when they can access their loan takes on average just one and a half business days and only minutes for most loans. This industry leading offer is delighting our clients and client promoter scores have increased roughly 30 percentage points in this product since 2021. With Client Segmentation, we're focused on serving distinct retail and advisor client groups with tailored solutions specific to their unique needs. RIAs have been and remain in an incredibly important client segment for Schwab. We have the same goal as the RIAs we serve to make a meaningful difference in the financial lives of our clients. And, we are committed to continuing to help our advisors grow, compete and succeed in pursuit of this mission. We have a world-class custody business, and we'll continue to invest in it to provide RIAs of all sizes with the open architecture platform and unmatched resources, services and education that they have come to expect from us. I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to dive into this in more detail at our upcoming IMPACT Conference next month. Turning to our retail business, we know that relationships matter and we're investing to give more of our clients access to a dedicated financial consultant. Our ultra-high net worth clients have been a particular area of focus as they have some of the most complex financial planning and wealth management needs among our client base. We've added additional expertise for this group, including wealth consultants and tax, trust and estate experts. We've also enhanced our approach to service and operations for this client group, all of which has been well received by clients as evidenced by their high-client promoter scores. We plan to launch retail alternatives to this client segment this quarter, which will be an important milestone for clients. Traders are another distinct and very important client segment for us. I believe that the combination of Schwab and Ameritrade has produced the strongest trader offer in the industry. And, we are continuing to enhance our capabilities, including investments in our mobile experience, our platform and our research and education. Our fourth strategic area is the Brilliant Basics. With the size of our client base, the most attractive opportunity we have for growth is to delight our existing clients with every interaction they have with us, so that they trust us with more of their assets, conduct more of their financial lives here at Schwab and refer others to us because we are delivering each day on the client experience. In our retail business, our average speed to answer the phone was less than 40 seconds in the third quarter. Year-to-date through the third quarter, the client easy score for our service teams is 92%. That's the highest score we've earned from clients in four years. And, the vast majority of incoming calls are addressed without the need to transfer the client call. In Advisor Services, our client easy score, which is a client's real-time rating of how easy it was to complete a specific task or transaction was 89% in the third quarter. And, in our workplace business, we were Ranked #1 by J.D. Power and Participant Satisfaction for our Retirement Plan Digital Experiences. I'm confident in our ability to deliver for clients today and I'm energized by the opportunity to do even more as we look ahead. And, as we look to the future, not just next quarter or next year, but through the cycle and for the long-term through client-size will remain the foundation of our strategy. Through client-size means we will relentlessly focus on serving the needs of individual investors, workplace clients and RIAs and the clients that they serve. True client-size is what will continue to drive the virtuous cycle and fuel our growth well into the future as we invest in the Brilliant Basics, Scale & Efficiency and serving more of our clients' needs across client segments. I do want to take just a moment here to express my gratitude to Walt for his vision, his leadership, his focus on our clients and the integrity and selflessness in which he has led our company. That vision is not changing as he transitions into his new role as Co-Chairman and I move into my new role as CEO in the New Year. I'm grateful to be stepping into this role in a period when our client capabilities have never been stronger and we are operating from a position of strength. And with that, I'll turn it over to Peter. Sure. Let me start with our organic growth. So overall, when we look at our Schwab only clients or legacy clients of Schwab, the growth of our legacy Schwab clients remains in that 5% to 7% growth range that we historically have seen. As it relates to Ameritrade clients, we're going through what is a natural process of Ameritrade clients coming to Schwab, joining our platform and realizing how much they love it. Our flows from Ameritrade clients have outperformed our expectations. Walt shared earlier the expected level of attrition that we thought we would see. We've seen less than that. We've outperformed that. And for two quarters in a row, we've begun to see former Ameritrade clients contribute positively to net new assets. So, our expectation is that over time as those clients become more familiar with our platform, get comfortable with it as we build a relationship with those clients because I think that's a big difference between some of what they would have experienced at Ameritrade and what they're experiencing now as part of Schwab is the relationship element of what we do, the service part of what we do. As they get to experience that, we believe they will contribute more net new assets over time and grow into the level that we see from our Schwab clients. So, we do expect that our long-term growth trajectory will continue. We expect our Ameritrade clients to continue to grow their net new assets at the firm as they've done the last 2 quarters. And importantly, all signs that we're seeing with our Ameritrade clients suggest that our relationship model is working. And if you look at our record flows into our wealth area, a significant portion over a third of the flows are coming from former Ameritrade clients. And if you look at our lending capabilities, half of new originations in our pledged asset line, half of the growth came from former Ameritrade clients. So, the push to put our arms around these Ameritrade clients, help them in their financial life just as we've done for Schwab clients is working and our expectation is that you'll see over the long-term our growth in the range that you've seen it at Schwab."

            "name": "Walter W. Bettinger",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our October business update. I've had the honor of speaking with all of you at these updates dating back to 2005, when I assumed responsibility for our Investor Services or Retail Business. Of course, as Jeff indicated going forward in my role as Executive Co-Chair, I won't be participating in these calls. So, I want to take a moment and thank all of you for your interest, your thoughtful questions as well as the insights you shared with me over the years. Through all the ups and downs that changing economic and competitive environments lead to, I've always respected your professionalism and integrity. So, thank you. So, let's go ahead and dive right into our discussion. The third quarter was an important quarter for us during this transition year. Some might refer to it as an inflection point, although only time will tell on that perspective. Nevertheless, Rick, Peter, Mike and I have a series of positive developments to share with you today. In the quarter, we made strong progress across virtually all key areas. Former Ameritrade clients are continuing to generate positive net new assets. That's the second quarter in a row. Our clients are growing transactional sweep cash balances. We've made meaningful progress in paying down supplemental funding. We're experiencing ongoing strengthening in firm-wide net new assets. Clients are enrolling into our retail advisory solutions at record levels. All these facts, along with other key metrics, illustrate the health of the franchise and fuel our solid optimism for the future. The third quarter did see some choppiness in the markets. Overall, our clients remain solidly engaged, and we continue to make progress on key areas of focus across the firm, which Rick will spend some more time on. I think at this point, any questions about our long-term growth trajectory should seemingly be fading. During the quarter, inflation eased and as the Fed began to lower interest rates, equity markets responded by reaching all-time highs. Investor sentiment remained bullish during the quarter. Overall trading activity was solid, including some modest softening late in the quarter as our traders digested the future of rates as well as an equity market at all-time highs. Client engagement was quite healthy across our full spectrum of capabilities, whether it'd be trading, banking services, advisory solutions, custody for RIAs, as well as asset management. For the quarter, trades were up about 4% from the prior quarter, while margin balances grew over $1 billion to end at $73 billion. Managed investing or retail advisory flows broke another record totaling $15 billion during the third quarter. Net new assets were also quite strong during what is sometimes a slower quarter given that the summer months are included. Net new assets more than doubled from the third quarter of last year, as former Ameritrade clients continued to generate positive, albeit still modest net asset flows. And, during the quarter, clients entrusted us with almost 1 million new brokerage accounts. Slide 9 here is particularly important for those who track our net new assets closely and have been trying to ascertain our progress back to our long-term track record of 5% to 7% organic growth. When we acquired Ameritrade, we recognized that we would be benefiting from a one-time large lift in client assets, but along with it would be the noise of attrition that we estimated at 5% to 6% of assets ultimately applied to nearly a $2 trillion client base. What we saw during the third quarter as more of that attrition faded into the rear view mirror was that year-to-date net new assets for this year crossed over the trajectory of net new assets in 2023. We all know that net new asset levels can be fickle as multiple factors influence them, from investor sentiment to market performance, interest rates and even the level of promotional cash for assets temporarily offered by some competitors. But, when we dig through the various factors that do influence net new assets, we remain quite confident in our plans to build our way back to our historical ranges. This confidence is further supported by the response from former Ameritrade clients. As these clients become more familiar with the Schwab platforms and service experience, we are seeing an increase in client promoter scores or client satisfaction, whether it be retail or RIA clients. Their engagement across the business in our various solutions is further evidence of the success of the integration. And, consistent with our best of both approach to the Ameritrade integration, Legacy Schwab clients are now taking advantage of the thinkorswim trading platform at a robust level. Consistent with prior years, we continue to be recognized by a variety of third-party sources for our quality of services, our overall client offering, as well as our reputation. We were particularly proud of the fact that Investor's Business Daily named Schwab Bank as the most trusted bank. Given the negative press and at times misperceptions regarding our bank over the past 18 months, we were especially pleased with this particular result. Rick, let me turn it over to you to review some more details of our progress serving clients and building the franchise. And I'll close this out, as Jeff indicated, after the Q&A session with just a few final observations. Thanks, Brian. Let me address the cash part again. I know Mike's already addressed it, but let me just make a quick comment there and I'll turn it over to Mike to talk about the NIM. We have cautioned for a long time an excessive focus on monthly cash movements, because you can simply have a one day difference making a huge impact in a monthly number depending on when fixed income maturities mature. Although the numbers are big, if you look at these numbers as a percentage of a $10 trillion client base, they are actually quite modest. And so the right way to look at it is at a quarter, not at a month. And we feel very good about where we ended up for the quarter. I don't think there is anything unique or one off in the results for the quarter. And that's why we feel confident about the fact that we continue to make progress in building of our balance sheet cash and anticipate that as we move forward taking into account the seasonality that Mike previously referenced. Mike, let me turn it over to you for NIM. Thanks for the question, Michael. Let me talk a little bit about our, Advisor Services business and start by just saying it's been a growth powerhouse for us. It continues to drive really strong net new asset formation, both in terms of the RIAs coming onto our platform and the growth of the RIAs for whom we custody assets. As we look at monetizing the business, I think there's lots of opportunity in the future. We have been trying to do more in wealth, asset management and lending to support our advisors. And you certainly see it, our growth in all three of those areas as evidenced by some of the numbers we shared earlier. RIAs have been asking us, almost begging for us to lend to them and their clients over time because they want to work directly with us and they don't want to introduce another party into the relationship. And as we've upped our game with our pledged asset line capability and some of our mortgage capabilities, more and more clients are keeping their lending business with us and we expect that as rates fall, we'll see that accelerate. We're also seeing on the wealth and the asset management side where our RIAs rely upon us in a number of different ways, including our fixed income capabilities, our Schwab personalized indexing capabilities, and a number of other areas. I also think that there's more we can do for RIAs over time. If you think about the value chain around the RIAs, there are a number of ways in which RIAs spend money in their business. And many of those ways are services that we could potentially provide and for which the RIA would prefer to work with us because it would make their life easier. Those are all areas that we are exploring. As it relates to custody fee, we have we believe our current model works and has served the test of time. We have asked RIAs if they would prefer a custody fee in lieu of or taking a different approach. And that has not been a popular idea when we've offered that to RIAs. So, we like our current model. We do think there's lots of ways to monetize our position with RIAs and we expect to do that over time in a way that is client friendly and helps us build our business and helps the RA build their business most importantly. Well, thanks all for dialing in and participating in our call today. As I mentioned in my opening thoughts, I've had the honor and the privilege to speak with many of you about Schwab's results for almost 20 years. During that time, I have learned so much from the thoughtful and seasoned analysts who cover our stock as well as the owners who I would regularly meet with. So, thank you. And as I make this transition from CEO to Executive Co-Chair, I'm especially grateful to the tens of thousands of Schwabis and the millions of clients who have helped us grow during my tenure, not only from an $18 billion market cap company to something around $125 billion but also quadruple our stock price. I realize that these numbers are the lenses that many will choose to look through to evaluate my time as CEO of Schwab. But if I could, I'd like to go back to the very first conversation that Chuck Schwab had with me about the possibility of being CEO of the company someday. This conversation actually happened several years before I formally became CEO. And during that conversation, I asked Chuck this question, if I do become CEO someday, what would be the most important objective that you would like me to achieve during my time as CEO? Now I fully expected Chuck to reply with maybe a certain level of client assets or client accounts, maybe a level of market capitalization or even the stock price. But for those of you who know Chuck well, you can probably suspect that his answer was none of those. Instead, Chuck shared that his definition of success would be if I did my part during my tenure to ensure that there would be a strong independent Schwab 50 years hence. Importantly, because in Chuck's words, investors need and deserve what we offer them. First rate service, great value, quality execution, professional advice, low cost mutual funds and ETFs, access independent investment advisors and so much more. And thanks to our employees, our 43 million clients and our long-term stockholders, Chuck has personally shared with me mission accomplished. Thank you all so much for joining us on our call today."

This is Jeff Edwards, Head of Investor Relations; and I'm joined today by our Co-Chairman and CEO, Walt Bettinger; President, Rick Wurster; and CFO, Peter Crawford. We got a bit of an early start today to beat the Texas heat, so let's run through our housekeeping items and get in today's remarks. The slides for today's business update will be posted to their usual spot on the IR website at the beginning of Peter's section. Q&A remains structured as one question, no follow-ups, please, but you can certainly reenter the queue to ask another question if time permits. And as always, please don't hesitate to reach out with any follow-up questions for the IR team. And lastly, the wall of words, which showcases our forward-looking statements, reminding us that the future is uncertain, so please stay in touch with our disclosures. And with that, I'll turn it over to Walt.\nWalt Bettinger: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our July business update. Earlier this year, we spoke about 2024 being a transition year for the firm. We define this year as transitional for a series of reasons. We were anticipating completing the last transition groups from the Ameritrade acquisition. And we anticipated that former Ameritrade clients would move from negative asset flows to positive levels of net new assets. We further anticipated that former Ameritrade retail clients would begin to utilize Schwab capabilities in the areas of investment advisory, financial planning and banking. We anticipated the investment advisers, who formerly used Ameritrade for custodial services, would also begin to bring net new assets to Schwab, and their evaluation of our service levels would improve rather dramatically. We anticipated that Schwab users of StreetSmart would begin to take advantage of the powerful trading capabilities in the Thinkorswim platforms. From a capital standpoint, we anticipated that we would organically build capital throughout the year toward our long-term objectives. And from a financial standpoint, we anticipated improving, albeit somewhat uneven, earnings results during the year with Q4 2024 delivering somewhere between $0.80 and $0.90, and then with strong growth continuing into 2025 and beyond. Halfway through the year, this definition of a transition year is being realized, again, as we anticipated. And all of these issues position us for a strong period of growth in client metrics and financial results in the coming years. So, with these critical indicators of success unfolding in such a positive manner, let's take a quick look tactically at how the second quarter of this year looked. Inflation showed some encouraging signs of moderating, closer to the Fed target of 2%, which continued pushing a select number of primarily technology stocks ever higher during the quarter. Investor sentiment remained solidly positive at quarter-end with investors purchasing stocks throughout the quarter and overall trading activity was a bit higher than in the prior year. Now as I stated earlier, as we anticipated, we completed the last client transition group during the second quarter. That's almost $2 trillion in assets, 17 million client accounts, and over 3.5 million daily average trades, all done with the attrition levels that are well below other integrations in our industry, as well as our estimates at the time of the acquisition, which were 5% to 6% asset attrition and 4% revenue attrition. And while it's still somewhat early, the client response to the combined platform has been even stronger than we anticipated. Promoter Scores for former Ameritrade retail clients are now increasing about 50 points nine months post conversion date. While the Promoter Scores for advisory services, including the former Ameritrade adviser clients, have returned to pre-conversion levels. Impressively, former Ameritrade retail clients who converted in 2023 are already bringing in assets on a net basis. However, their level of net new assets still remains below our target range. Clearly, this illustrates that we're reaching an inflection point as attrition continues to abate and we rebuild back to firm-wide net new asset levels in our targeted 5% to 7% range. And lastly, former Ameritrade retail clients are already making up about one-third of our overall enrollments in advisory solutions, an early illustration of the power of combining the two firms and their interest in Schwab's broader offering of wealth management solutions. The overall client engagement was solid in the second quarter with the equity buy-sell ratio at about 1.1, while daily average trades remained at relatively high levels for a second quarter and above the same period from last year. Meanwhile, we've seen a large increase in interest among our clients in our Managed Investing solutions. So overall, key client metrics continue to be solid. Net new assets year-to-date were over $150 billion, including Q2 asset gathering of about $60 billion, up 17% from the same period last year, again, still somewhat below our long-term goal of 5% to 7% to an economic cycle but growing closer to that figure as the impact from former Ameritrade client attrition begins to wane. New brokerage accounts were again almost $1 million -- I'm sorry, 1 million accounts during the quarter. Looking deeper at the types of clients we're attracting. These new-to-firm households continue to set us up well for the long term with almost six out of 10 new clients under the age of 40. And investment adviser clients of all sizes continue to entrust their client assets to our custodial services. For years, we've emphasized that Schwab Advisor Services is the premier offering for RIAs of all sizes, and we are equally committed to each segment of advisers. And these net new asset results are particularly encouraging as they reflect our success serving again every size adviser. Let me take a brief step back to take a more big-picture look at Schwab and the growth trajectory we've been on for over 50 years. From our origins as a discount broker, we have continually listened to client needs, as well as anticipated client needs, and added services and capabilities along the way. What is key is that we have always done so in a Schwab Way, through clients' eyes, at a great value and without the client having to accept trade-offs. We call that modern wealth management. And when we look to the future, we believe this formula will only serve to build our market share larger and larger. Of course, one of the key capabilities we have added along the way has been banking services to meet the needs of our clients on both sides of their personal balance sheets. Now some have asked us after the regional banking crisis of 2023 whether we remain committed to serving our clients' banking needs. And the answer is a definite yes. That said, we have studied our approach to offering banking services in recent quarters and wanted to share a few additional perspectives on how we see banking unfolding in the future at Schwab. Offering lending services to our retail clients and the clients of the investment advisers we serve is important. Arguably, it's critical as it meets client needs and deepens relationships in a meaningful way. Most of our significant competitors have the ability to assist clients with both their investing needs as well as their borrowing needs. We believe firms that do not offer lending services are at a strategic disadvantage that will show itself more and more over time. So, we are committed to offering quality lending services in a manner consistent with how we lend today, exclusively for our clients, residential mortgages, HELOCs for clients who have their first mortgage with us, and pledged asset lines. And to support lending for our clients, we continue to invest in both technology to make the application and approval process streamlined and efficient, as well as experienced bankers who can help shepherd the more complex loans through. From the standpoint of the investments we make at the bank for deposits in excess of those needed for lending to our clients, over time, and by that, I mean, years, not months or quarters, we would envision some shortening of our overall balance sheet investment portfolio duration. That could lead to some modestly higher earnings volatility through an interest rate cycle but should help reduce volatility of our capital levels and the need to access supplemental borrowing when interest rates potentially rise rapidly. One of our objectives is to increase our emphasis on attracting transactional bank deposits like checking balances with our award-winning checking product. This would serve as a means of increasing liquidity and further stabilizing our overall deposit base. And we envision the potential to increase our usage of third-party banks like TD Bank and others to achieve the following goals, deliver extended FDIC insurance for clients, lower our capital intensity, and improve liquidity, subject, of course, to obtaining economics from the third-party banks that make sense for us. Net, these various actions should lead, again, over time to a bank that is somewhat smaller than our bank has been in recent years, while retaining the ability to meet our clients' banking needs, lower our capital intensity and, importantly, protect the economics we are able to generate from owning a bank. So, while we see some modest changes in the way we manage and operate our bank, one thing you can count on, we will continue to operate our business in the Schwab Way, making decisions through clients' eyes, offering clients great value, and delivering service and advice to our valued clients without asking for any trade-offs. So Rick, let me turn it over to you for some more discussion on our efforts as well as results during the second quarter.\nRick Wurster: Thanks, Walt, and good morning, everyone. With the successful completion of the Ameritrade conversion behind us, we are looking ahead to an exciting new chapter as we continue to advance our four strategic focus areas. And we will do so from a position of strength, having fully combined the best of Schwab and Ameritrade to offer our clients a no trade-offs experience. Our ability to increase our scale while also continuously driving efficiency in our operations remains one of our key competitive advantages. The Ameritrade integration is a clear example of how we have vastly increased our scale while cutting costs. And by the end of this year, we'll realize the remaining 10% of run rate expense synergies from the acquisition. Over time, our growing client base, our cost discipline and our ongoing investments in technology will continue to help us reduce our cost to serve our clients, in the same way it has over the past decade as we've decreased our cost per client account by 25% and by around 50% when you consider inflation. We plan to build on this competitive advantage. We will invest in technology, including artificial intelligence, that will ultimately help us lower our costs. We will implement operational enhancements and process transformation so we can serve our clients even more efficiently than we do today. And as we continue to increase our scale and enhance our efficiency, we'll reinvest in our clients over time and support our growth for the long term, just as we've done historically. Win-win monetization is about meeting more of our clients' total financial needs. By offering the ease and convenience of having more of their financial life in one place, we're also able to bolster our revenue growth and our wealth business is growing quickly. And this is a win for clients as Client Promoter Scores for our advice solutions are among the highest at the firm. So, these are our happiest clients. And it is a win for us. Year-to-date, we've attracted nearly $25 billion in Managed Investing net flows, a 56% increase over last year. And we see strong net flows across our spectrum of solutions. And you can see the growth on this page: 40% in Schwab Wealth Advisory, 53% in Wasmer Schroeder, and 127% and in Schwab Personalized Indexing. By offering our clients a broad spectrum of the wealth solutions they need, we're also supporting growth in our fee-based revenue streams, as you can see with the growth in our revenue on the right-hand side of this page. Looking within our Wealth Solutions, I wanted to do a bit of a deeper dive into our Wasmer strategies. These fixed income strategies provide clients with a wide range of tax-exempt and taxable solutions. Clients also have access to a dedicated team of portfolio managers and portfolio personalization capabilities, all at a lower cost than competitive offerings. With total assets under management of $25 billion, we've seen assets in these strategies grow at a compound annual growth rate of 23% since our acquisition in July of 2020 and have grown by nearly 80% in the last two years where we've had a higher interest rate environment. This year-to-date alone, we've seen net flows of $4 billion, demonstrating that these solutions are indeed meeting client needs. Turning now to client segmentation. At Schwab, we will always meet the needs of a wide spectrum of investors and RIA firms, but we also need to serve our distinct client segments. And strong relationships are the foundation of our ability to do this. When we build relationships by meeting client needs and meeting clients where they are and with the service models, the tailored education and the specialized capabilities they need, we will retain our existing clients and attract new ones. RIAs, which are one of our key client segments, we strengthened our relationships with RIAs of all sizes through an unparalleled offer that helps each of them grow, compete and succeed. For example, we offer advisers turnkey asset management solutions, flexible technology, and highly specialized business consultant teams, all at an incredible value with zero custody fees and no intention of changing that. Turning to our retail business, high net worth retail clients are another important segment where the power of strong relationships is clear. Our high net worth retail investors who have a financial consultant, bringing more than 3x the average household net new assets, 2.8x the Managed Investing net flows, and have better TOA ratios, and notably higher Client Promoter Scores compared to retail high net worth clients who do not have an FC. Continuing to invest so we can build and expand on these valuable client relationships will help support our growth over the long term. Our fourth strategic focus area is the Brilliant Basics. We know that we can make it even easier for our clients to do business with us, and if we can deliver on the basics for our clients in every interaction they have at Schwab, we'll build loyalty and our delighted clients will grow their wealth with us and refer their friends and family members to us. One example of how we're delivering on this for clients is the enhancements we continue to make to the best-in-class Schwab mobile app. We know clients and third parties like it today. Our mobile app has a 4.8-star rating on the App Store. And for the second year in a row, Corporate Insight has ranked us the number one mobile app experience among brokerage firms. And we continue to invest in and enhance that experience. We're introducing features our former Ameritrade clients love, like the recently launched customizable dashboard. Other recent and planned enhancements will simplify the client experience by reducing clicks and expanding on our customization capabilities. Guided by our consistent through client-size strategy, we remain well positioned for continued growth. While there are several factors that can influence asset gathering in the near term, things like the macroeconomic environment, seasonality and some behavioral differences we see in the former Ameritrade client base, we believe our through-the-cycle growth recipe remains intact. Over the longer term, we expect we'll continue to see 5% to 7% annualized NNA growth from existing and new clients, bolstered by delivering on our four strategic focus areas. As we've shared, 2024 is a transition year, with strong client engagement, a successful integration, continued progress on our strategic focus areas, and opportunities to introduce our client base to the best of Schwab and Ameritrade, we remain well positioned to continue serving our growing client base and delivering profitable long-term growth to stockholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Peter.\nPeter Crawford: Well, thank you very much, Rick. So, Walt and Rick talked about the exciting results we've already seen from the Ameritrade integration and the opportunities it enables, our strong momentum in the market and the success we have enjoyed in attracting a diverse mix of clients, the progress we have made in continuing to enhance our leading value proposition at the same time that we continue to drive greater efficiency throughout our business. And finally, our commitment to continuing that journey, combining ever greater efficiency with sustained investments in improving the client experience. For my time today, I'll review our solid financial performance in the second quarter and over the first half of the year. I'll provide some high-level perspective on what we're seeing with regard to our clients' transactional cash, and I'll share an updated scenario for 2024. The important point is that we are proceeding through what we've described previously, and what Walt talked about at the outset, as a transitional year. But frankly, at a slightly faster pace than we had anticipated just six months ago, with our organic growth rebounding towards historical levels, a continued moderation of client cash realignment activity despite seasonal pressures and the impact of very high investor engagement, sequential growth in our net interest margin, continued expense discipline with adjusted expenses basically flat year-over-year excluding some unusual items, and finally, a steady increase in our capital levels, both our regulatory levels and those inclusive of AOCI. And all of that sets the stage for what we expect will be more of a return to normal, the unlocking of our core earnings power and, frankly, a much simpler financial story in the quarters and years ahead, but one featuring strong growth in revenue and earnings in the back half of 2024 and over the next several years. As Walt mentioned, the first half of the year has been characterized by strong equity markets, increased client engagement and solid organic growth. We saw that reflected in external benchmarks such as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ, as well as key drivers of our business performance, including margin balances up 15% from the end of 2023, trading activity up slightly from the first six months of last year, and as Rick mentioned, a real surge in interest among clients for our advisory solutions. Our clients' transactional cash balances are typically pressured in the first half of the year by engagement in the markets in January and February and then tax season in April and early May. And that was no different in 2024. But even so, we continue to see a moderation of the rate-driven client cash realignment activity. Now that backdrop helped support solid financial performance in the second quarter, with revenue up 1% year-over-year to $4.7 billion. Adjusted expenses in Q2 were up just under 2% year-over-year, but that included several onetime and/or unusual items without which our adjusted expenses would have been down more than 1%. We produced an adjusted pretax margin of roughly 41% and adjusted EPS of $0.73. Turning our attention to the balance sheet. Total assets dropped by 4%, driven primarily by tax-related outflows and the continuation, albeit at a much slower pace, of the client cash realignment activity we have experienced for a little over two years. And the overall level of realignment within Bank Sweep and Schwab One in the quarter was down about 50% versus the same quarter in 2023. Now as I mentioned earlier, we have seen strong growth in margin utilization to start the year. And to support that activity, we directed about $5 billion of client cash from the banks to the broker-dealers. That caused our level of supplemental borrowing to rise slightly in the quarter. What I want to emphasize again, that this is a good thing. We are more than happy to absorb a bit more borrowing on which we're paying just over 5% to support margin loans on which we're earning just under 8%. And finally, despite rates that increased slightly during the quarter, our capital position continued to get even stronger. With our adjusted Tier 1 leverage ratio, again, reminding you that's the one that's inclusive of AOCI and, therefore, what our binding constraint would be if we lose the AOCI opt-out, at Schwab Bank now well over 6% and just under 6% for the Company overall. Meaning, we are marching steadily towards our new operating objective for capital. Now despite the influence of typical seasonal pressure to start the year coupled with atypically bullish, very bullish, investor sentiment, client cash balances have largely trended consistent with our expectations, despite rates remaining higher than the Fed and the market predicted earlier in the year. And all indications support that we are in the very late innings of client cash realignment activity. In fact, over the course of Q2, client-driven outflows from Bank Sweep despite the seasonal tax payments, have been less than the cash flow generated from our investment portfolio, which in the absence of any other actions on our part would have led to continued decline to supplemental borrowing. Now with new client acquisition and organic growth returning to our historical norms, and all signs suggesting that the Fed funds rate has likely peaked, meaning, in the absence of this catalyst, we expect the utilization of investment cash alternatives such as purchase money funds and CDs to stabilize and then eventually decrease over time, we believe we're nearing the point where aggregate transactional cash balances should flatten and then ultimately resume growing again. Now that solid start to the year lays the foundation for what we expect will be an even stronger end of the year, propelling us into growth through 2025 and beyond. We now expect our full year revenue to range between flat to up 2% versus 2023 or roughly in the middle of the mathematical illustrations you may recall we shared back in January. And as I shared back in May at our Investor Day, we now expect our adjusted expenses to be approximately 2% higher than 2023. And as a reminder, about half that change from the previous guidance is due to unanticipated onetime items such as the FDIC surcharge and the regulatory accrual, with the remainder coming from the increase in the SEC 31 fee, which is, again, is a pass-through expense and, therefore, P&L neutral. But to use the transitional word again, that annualized view masks the progression in earnings power by the end of the year. We're expecting flattish earnings from Q2 to Q3, but assuming the Fed cuts rates in September as is widely expected, we could see our NIM reach the mid-2.20s in Q4 on its way to approaching 3% by the end of 2025, which we believe will support adjusted earnings per share in the middle of the $0.80 to $0.90 range we outlined at the beginning of the year, with our earnings power building in 2025 and beyond. Despite long-term rates moving a little bit higher during the quarter, our capital levels are climbing steadily, and we continue to expect our consolidated adjusted Tier 1 leverage ratio to approach our slightly updated operating objective of 6.75% to 7% on a consolidated basis by the end of 2024, at which point it becomes more of a live conversation regarding whether and how we want to do further capital return, our number one priority for capital is always to support business growth. Now to the extent that we have capital in excess of what is needed to do that, we have, throughout our history, taking steps to return that to stockholders. That can be through increasing our dividend, which generally rises alongside earnings. That can be by redeeming outstanding preferreds to create additional dry powder for the future, especially preferreds that might be or might become relatively expensive, and that can also be, of course, through stock buybacks, which we do opportunistically. There is one additional consideration right now, which is to the extent that we have outstanding supplemental borrowing, we may choose to utilize some of the liquidity we'd otherwise use for buybacks to reduce some of that bank-level debt. Now doing that reduces our reliance on nonbusiness-as-usual funding sources, and given the relatively higher cost of the supplemental borrowing, it's likely more accretive to earnings in the near term, while preserving the capacity, the ability to implement stock repurchases at a later date. So by doing that, we can kind of have our cake and eat it too. Now those of you who have followed the Company for a while know that we don't tend to communicate bold, long-term financial targets. Rather, we continue to talk about our long-term financial formula, a relatively simple and straightforward formula that is based on our clear and straightforward business strategy, which we articulated, as you know, is through clients' eyes. And what makes that financial formula simple and straightforward is that it's based on a set of a pretty reasonable assumptions, for Schwab at least, around organic growth, revenue growth, expense containment and capital return, assumptions that we have delivered through the cycle over multiple decades. Over the last two-plus years, that formula has admittedly been obscured to an extent by the impact of rising rates and what that has done to client transactional cash balances. But with rates seeming to plateau and client cash realignment moderating, while organic growth returns to that historical level, we're nearing the point where that simple and straightforward formula, that simple and straightforward financial story should become more clear, one that without making some big leap of faith combined strong organic growth, strong profitability and substantial capital return. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff to facilitate our Q&A. Jeff?\nJeff Edwards: Thank you very much, Peter. Operator, can you please remind everyone how they may ask a question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks very much for the presentation. Maybe just, Peter, could you talk about your view on how you make deposit rates as the Fed cuts -- and I guess, first and foremost is your assumption in your targets based on, I guess, how many Fed cuts are based on that? And then just maybe just talk about how you might reduce direct deposit rates in sweep and the banking deposits as the Fed cuts -- essentially the deposit beta to that?\nPeter Crawford: Sure. So, thanks, Brian. So, the scenario that I outlined is based off the Fed cutting rates a single time in the rest of this year in September. In terms of deposit betas, I wouldn't necessarily assume that deposit betas are symmetrical. If you look historically, deposit betas tend to be a bit higher on the -- in the easing cycle than they are in a tightening cycle. And so, while we certainly haven't made any decisions exactly about what we'll do with deposit rates, I think that's a reasonable expectation. And we also would expect that as rates come down, the cost of any replacement supplemental funding that we have to access comes down as well. And we'd also expect that, on the margin, that rate cuts would, over time, bring about higher levels of clients' transactional cash as the incentive for them to utilize alternative solutions like purchase money funds and CDs become somewhat less.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nKen Worthington: In terms of the use of third-party banks like TD, how much of your bank assets might migrate to third-party banks over time at sort of steady state? And how would you expect the economics to compare to the fees that you currently earn on a money market fund or in the Schwab Bank spread over rate cycle? And I guess lastly, given the Wells comments on Friday, is there a risk that using third-party banks might risk regulators having an opinion on the yields passed on to certain end-customers in the advisory or other segments of your business?\nWalt Bettinger: Yes. So, I think it's I think it's early to have definitive answers on the first set of questions that you asked. Although if you research our IDA agreement with TD Bank, it probably gives you a good direction with respect to the economics. The economics can be very attractive for us in terms of not needing to have capital relative to those deposits. And that's where I would probably direct you to look in terms of the economics of that. In terms of the level, we want to make sure that we maintain sufficient deposits at our bank to, again, fund the loans that our clients want, and then have appropriate levels of liquidity over and above that. With respect to the Wells Fargo issue, we have provided money market fund sweep cash and -- or money market yields on bank cash for all of our fiduciary-driven investment advisory solutions already. So, I don't really see the Wells Fargo report having any kind of meaningful implications for us. We've been doing this for an extended period of time already.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Please go ahead.\nKyle Voigt: Good morning. Just maybe on the Ameritrade attrition abating and net new assets getting back to that 5% to 7% level as they have grown historically. I guess with the knowledge of doing prior brokerage integrations, albeit at a smaller scale than the Ameritrade integration, so do you have any expectation of when you could get back into that range? And typically, when do you see attrition effectively fully abate after the last migration, which we've obviously just went through?\nWalt Bettinger: Let me start by saying first -- thanks for the question, Kyle. Let me start by saying when we look at our Schwab client base, we continue to grow within that 5% to 7% organic growth rate that we target over the long term. When you look at the Company level metrics, what's keeping us from the 5% to 7% overall is, in fact, behavior of the Ameritrade clients. And the great thing that we're seeing is we are seeing a change in their behavior. And it's in line with what we would expect, which is, first, we need to stop clients from leaving the firm and from Ameritrade flows being negative. And I think we're in the process of that happening. Walt referenced the significant improvement in Client Promoter Scores. That's true both on the retail side and the adviser side. So, Client Promoter Scores are getting higher. As those Client Promoter Scores are getting higher, we're moving from outflows from our Ameritrade clients to inflows. What we then need to do is to move a client base that hasn't had client flows quite in line with where Schwab organic growth rate has been historically. We need to move them from being positive contributors to net new assets to contributing at the same level as Schwab -- as our Schwab organic growth rate. And the way we'll do that is by introducing our Schwab model to Ameritrade clients, the financial consultant, the relationship model, the service, the advice, the consultants that we bring on the advisory side. All of that, we believe, will help accelerate the Ameritrade net new asset formation. So, we're confident we can grow in the 5% to 7% range. We continue to do so on the Schwab side today. And we're right where we'd expect to be in terms of the process of moving Ameritrade clients from being net detractors in net new assets to now being slightly positive. And then, we anticipate by introducing our model to them to be able to grow them to the same level as Schwab clients over time.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDan Fannon: Peter, I was hoping you could elaborate on your assumptions on what's going to drive the sequential growth really after being flat in Q3 to Q4, and specifically things like margin balances, which are growing, but as you said, are drawing more short-term funding. So curious about short-term funding levels plus some of the other assumptions in that Q3 to Q4 ramp.\nPeter Crawford: Yes. So, we can -- certainly, we can follow up with -- we have a number of assumptions on the page there, and you're welcome to follow up with the IR team in terms of some of the details. But broadly speaking, as I mentioned previously, the assumptions are as a single Fed cut in September, client cash realignment activity that continues to moderate. We expect it will flatten and then, again, ultimately resume growth. And then more of a continuation of the general -- relatively conventional assumptions on equity market depreciation, margin balance growth that goes along with that and so forth. In terms of supplemental borrowing, our priority, of course, is to pay that down as quickly as we can. But the pace at which we pay that down, it is dependent on the level of margin balance growth. And if we see -- continue to see more margin balance growth, we will, as we always do, want to make sure we support that growth. And at times, that means moving some cash out of the -- some client cash out of the bank over to the broker-dealer. But again, that is a -- we welcome the margin balance growth. It's good for clients. It means we're -- our clients are engaged, that we are supporting our active trader community, which is a very important segment for us. It's a very profitable interest-earning assets. So, we're more than happy to support that even if it means that it delays, to a certain extent, the pay-down of supplemental borrowing. It's accretive from a NIM standpoint, accretive from a net interest revenue standpoint, and so forth. So, it's why it's really, I think, I'd caution everyone not to focus on supplemental borrowing just in isolation in a vacuum, because it's influenced by other factors as well.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good morning. So, Peter, you had outlined a couple of different self-help levers. I mean, the first is the potential to migrate additional cash off balance sheet in the future. I actually wanted to focus on the potential opportunity to accelerate pay-downs of the high-cost liabilities by repositioning the securities portfolio. And I was hoping you could just unpack what are some of the constraints that we should be mindful of when thinking through the potential opportunity. And is it fair to assume that you would likely wait until you're at your capital target at which point you would maybe consider pursuing that path?\nPeter Crawford: Yes. So, thanks for the question, Steven. So, I would say, I know we've gotten this question -- we've gotten this question a fair amount. And our thinking on repositioning trade hasn't really changed. We certainly understand the benefit of that on accelerating the paydown of supplemental borrowing, accelerating the net interest margin accretion, earnings accretion that we expect to happen over time. At the same time, we're very cognizant of, and very mindful, of doing anything that would jeopardize the trust our clients place in us, especially for the sake of, moving forward, something that we expect will happen on its own. And so that's why we haven't done that. So, I would say it's not something we, by any means, rule out altogether, but it's also not something we're looking to do in the near term.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrennan Hawken: I'd like to follow up on the question around the shift to third-party banks as a place for deposits. So just at a high level, I'm curious if you could explain to us the strategic shift here because we spoke about it a year ago at the last what used to be the winter business update, now is the Investor Day, although I guess -- well, in 2023, it was at a different timing. And there was a defense of using the bank subsidiary. So, what led you to shift there? And then maybe just like timing-wise, when should we expect this to happen? And how do you strike the -- you referenced that you want liquidity above the need to fund the loans. How should we be thinking about what the bank will actually look like once things settle out and you take this journey?\nPeter Crawford: Yes. Thanks, Brennan. And so as I indicated, we're talking about years, not months and quarters. And we just want to foreshadow that, over those period of years, we think that there may be approaches that are more efficient in terms of rewarding our clients as well as rewarding our stockholders than maintaining 100% of the deposits at our bank. We want deposits, as I indicated, to be sufficient to cover the loans that we intend to do for our clients, that provide quality yields, deepen relationships and we're able to do at exceptionally low credit risk, as well as having liquidity beyond that. But we all recognize that deposit flows can be very volatile depending on rate environments. And we have in place one agreement already today that provides us substantial flexibility for client deposits with exceptional economics for us without the need for capital. And we think that there are other opportunities to consider expanding that. Again, I want to emphasize, the prepared remarks I made, that this is all subject to the economics of doing so. But we do think there are meaningful opportunities to lighten some of the capital load over time, again, measured in years, not months and quarters, that will provide us additional flexibility and also let us extend FDIC insurance to higher levels for our clients.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Benjamin Budish from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Budish: Just thinking about the sort of cash inflows over the next maybe six to eight quarters, can you maybe provide an update on your expected pace of securities maturing off of the balance sheet? I think you've talked before about the back half of '24. But is there any update you could perhaps provide on what to expect in 2025?\nPeter Crawford: Yes. So, I mean I think I would think about that in terms of the pace of cash flows off the investment portfolio as sort of in the $10 billion to $11 billion a quarter, somewhere in that range, as the portfolio -- the size of the portfolio goes down, that it's reasonable to expect that that level of cash flow goes down as well, sort of commensurate with that. But sort of -- and that's a general rule of thumb over the next several quarters, I think, is a reasonable expectation.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blostein: Well, so a lot of these things we're talking about for the last several quarters are related to kind of self-help levers and improvement in the Company's earnings power ultimately start with improvement in the deposit trajectory of the business that will help supplement the borrowings, capital returns, et cetera. So maybe help us sort of refresh, now that you've had the business with Ameritrade for some time, how are you thinking about the normalized framework for growth in Schwab's deposits, sweep deposits, whether it's a percentage of net new assets or some other metric, but I guess also considering that, even if we do get rate cuts, the Fed funds rate and the market rate is still going to be probably meaningfully higher versus kind of the available deposit yield that you and the industry are offering.\nPeter Crawford: Yes. Thanks, Alex, for the question. So, I know there's a lot of focus on kind of month-to-month, even at times week-to-week changes in deposit flows. I think it's important to maybe set a little bit of context. So, first is deposit flows over a short period of time are influenced by net new assets, of course, the cash is brought in from new accounts, and then what clients do with that cash. And that can be rate-driven allocations that they make to purchase money funds, CDs and so forth. It can also be into engagement in the markets, equities, mutual funds and so forth. And so that can create some variability. We have seen strong engagement in the markets. And when we look at the rate-driven activity among our clients, that continues to go down. The second point of context I would make, which is that you do see variability in those flows from, frankly, from day to day or month to month. And we can see $2 billion or $3 billion of net inflows or outflows on a particular day. And so, when you just look at a month's numbers, depending on what day of the week the month ends on, it can influence the level of transactional cash that we report on that monthly basis. And I'd say June was sort of -- was comparable to May. July has started off stronger. It's still early, it's about halfway through the month, so we'll see how the month ends. But it is -- it started off definitely stronger than in terms of deposit flows than May. In terms of the long term, to your question long term, we would expect in a stable environment that client transactional cash grows with the growth in accounts and the growth in total assets. We actually recently did a study to look at clients who opened their accounts roughly 20 years ago. And what we see over time is, as those clients increase the net worth in their accounts, increase assets in their accounts, their cash balances go up and they actually stay at a relatively constant percent of the assets in the account. And so, I think as you are modeling our transactional cash over a long period of time, over years, I think it's reasonable to expect that that transactional cash grows with the growth in assets and the growth in accounts. When rates are rising, it will -- growth will be a little bit lower, and rates are falling, that growth will be a little bit faster. But I think over time in a stable environment, that's a reasonable expectation over, again, over multiple years.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Bill Katz from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nBill Katz: Maybe a two-parter. The first one is just in terms of the Ameritrade metrics you had mentioned in terms of not up to the 5% to 7% growth rate that you're experiencing with legacy platform, can you scale and size the two relative asset pools that we're speaking to? And then the broader question I have is just as you're thinking now about migrating the growth of the bank, how should we be thinking about the end state of the size of the bank? And does this change your capital return methodology?\nWalt Bettinger: Let me start with the Ameritrade part of the question. We brought over about $2 trillion of Ameritrade client assets. We're at $9.4 trillion overall. So, Ameritrade is clearly an important part of our business. Looking at the longer term, important to remember the enthusiasm we have for the combination of the strength of Ameritrade and Schwab. We were talking a lot about short-term dynamics around cash and net interest margin and things like that. We have an incredible franchise that we've just spent four years putting together the best of everything Ameritrade had to offer with the best of everything Schwab has to offer. And the behavior we're seeing from our clients is exactly what we would expect. We went from clients who experienced a lot of change and might have had dual relationships at Ameritrade and somewhere else, making the decision that this wasn't where they wanted to be. And so we did see some attrition. That attrition was well below what our expectations were. And now we're seeing what we'd expect to see in the next phase, which is client satisfaction from those clients that were moved, who had their experience change, improving dramatically. We're up 35 points in our advisory services business in terms of our overall client promoter scores following the conversion. And on the retail side, nine months after a client moves, their satisfaction is up 50 points. So, we have built a platform that both sets of clients love. And now what we get to do for the long term and for the foreseeable future is deliver our mission of making a difference in our clients' lives through a platform that's never been stronger on the retail side and the adviser side than it is right now today. And so, we're confident in our long-term organic growth rate. We think the behavior we're seeing is exactly in line with what we would have expected, and are very optimistic for our future growth.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Maybe just circling back to the Wells Fargo announcement. Maybe you could just help clarify for us the magnitude of cash that you have in fiduciary accounts, the types of accounts these represent where you offer the money funding equivalent yields, is this just retirement only? And then just more broadly, how do you think about the risk over the long term that industry practices evolve with more account types over time that capture these money fund equivalent yields?\nWalt Bettinger: So, I just want to clarify, in our fiduciary relationships where we -- in our Managed Investing programs, our wealth programs, cash assets are invested in a sweep government money fund. So, we don't have this exposure that Wells Fargo has.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Chris Allen from Citi. Please go ahead.\nChris Allen: I wanted to ask about the 3% NIM outlook for 2025. Just wondering what are the parameters that you're baking in to get there? Does this entail any of the changes that you talked about around the balance sheet strategy in terms of shortening duration as well?\nPeter Crawford: Yes. Thanks, Chris. So, the 3% -- approaching -- NIM approaching 3% by the end of 2025, the primary driver of that is, again, the moderation of the client transactional cash realignment activity and the paydown of the supplemental borrowing. That is very, very accretive to our net interest margin. In terms of whether the comments that Walt provided have any influence over that, I'd just reiterate what he said, which is that is something that's evolutionary, not revolutionary. It's going to play out over multiple years. And so, it doesn't influence at all really the -- that more near-term outlook that we have for the end of -- towards the end of 2025. Thanks for the question.\nJeff Edwards: Operator, I think that time for one short question, and then we're going to close.\nOperator: Absolutely. Our final question comes from the line of Devin Ryan from Citizens JMP. Please go ahead.\nDevin Ryan: Just had a question about lending. And obviously, it's been an area you guys have been talking about both at the Investor Day and then today as well. Just thinking about kind of where Schwab is, your 40 basis point decline assets. I think you highlighted that the industry [Technical Difficulty] [00:57:24] percent. So just would love to get some color around where -- how much of that gap do you think you could actually close just with your, I guess, suite of products, number one. And number two, what you're comfortable going to in terms of the mix of the balance sheet, especially just given some of the evolution of the balance sheet we're talking about today as well.\nWalt Bettinger: Thanks for the question, Devin. We certainly think we can expand our lending capabilities. And the way we're focused on doing that is by creating the easiest, most straightforward, client-friendly process in the industry. We've seen that within our pledged asset line program where it's now 1.7 days average cycle time to get a pledged asset line. It's actually less than a day for individual and joint accounts, but our more complex ones drive up the average time. 85% of those originations are now done digitally. These are major enhancements. And we're making other enhancements to our mortgage process, to the way we lend to our higher net worth clients and the experience they have. So, we're trying to build an experience that makes it such that our Schwab clients never want to borrow somewhere else, they want to borrow from us. So, we do think there is lots of runway to close that gap, and we're quite bullish on our -- on the opportunity here. Now, we are in an interest rate environment where there's not as much borrowing as we've seen historically, not as much rolling over of loans and things. But we are confident that we've built the process, the experience and the offer that we should be for our clients an exceptional place to borrow. And that includes our industry-leading rates for clients that have assets with us. Final comment I'd make is it's also a terrific way to add to the service that we provide to our adviser clients. Our advisers for years have been asking us to do more lending because they don't want to have to introduce another party into the relationship. And increasingly, we're able to meet their needs, which delights them, and we think we'll be able to do more of that over time.\nPeter Crawford: All right. Well, I think it's my opportunity or my time to close. I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning and hearing our thoughts on the business and the opportunity in front of us. I think it's very easy to focus on very near-term practical measures. And as client cash realignment activity, plus or minus $1 billion, or supplement our borrowing or net interest margin in terms of -- which we measure in terms of basis points. And those of you who follow the Company for a long time know that we manage for the long term. We have a very long-term orientation. Our faith in our clients, our faith in our strategy, our confidence in that strategy really helps us remain focused on long term. And Walt described this year at the outset as a transitional year. And I think as we sit here halfway through the year, we feel really good about how that transition is going in terms of our strategic positioning, in terms of the completion of the Ameritrade integration and the satisfaction of those clients, in terms of the organic growth, the capital levels, and even the financial performance. And we certainly recognize the journey is not over by any means. We're feeling very confident about where we are and where we're going. Thanks, everyone, again, and we look forward to speaking with you again in October.",

            "name": "Peter Crawford",
            "content": "Well, thank you very much, Rick. So, Walt and Rick talked about the exciting results we've already seen from the Ameritrade integration and the opportunities it enables, our strong momentum in the market and the success we have enjoyed in attracting a diverse mix of clients, the progress we have made in continuing to enhance our leading value proposition at the same time that we continue to drive greater efficiency throughout our business. And finally, our commitment to continuing that journey, combining ever greater efficiency with sustained investments in improving the client experience. For my time today, I'll review our solid financial performance in the second quarter and over the first half of the year. I'll provide some high-level perspective on what we're seeing with regard to our clients' transactional cash, and I'll share an updated scenario for 2024. The important point is that we are proceeding through what we've described previously, and what Walt talked about at the outset, as a transitional year. But frankly, at a slightly faster pace than we had anticipated just six months ago, with our organic growth rebounding towards historical levels, a continued moderation of client cash realignment activity despite seasonal pressures and the impact of very high investor engagement, sequential growth in our net interest margin, continued expense discipline with adjusted expenses basically flat year-over-year excluding some unusual items, and finally, a steady increase in our capital levels, both our regulatory levels and those inclusive of AOCI. And all of that sets the stage for what we expect will be more of a return to normal, the unlocking of our core earnings power and, frankly, a much simpler financial story in the quarters and years ahead, but one featuring strong growth in revenue and earnings in the back half of 2024 and over the next several years. As Walt mentioned, the first half of the year has been characterized by strong equity markets, increased client engagement and solid organic growth. We saw that reflected in external benchmarks such as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ, as well as key drivers of our business performance, including margin balances up 15% from the end of 2023, trading activity up slightly from the first six months of last year, and as Rick mentioned, a real surge in interest among clients for our advisory solutions. Our clients' transactional cash balances are typically pressured in the first half of the year by engagement in the markets in January and February and then tax season in April and early May. And that was no different in 2024. But even so, we continue to see a moderation of the rate-driven client cash realignment activity. Now that backdrop helped support solid financial performance in the second quarter, with revenue up 1% year-over-year to $4.7 billion. Adjusted expenses in Q2 were up just under 2% year-over-year, but that included several onetime and/or unusual items without which our adjusted expenses would have been down more than 1%. We produced an adjusted pretax margin of roughly 41% and adjusted EPS of $0.73. Turning our attention to the balance sheet. Total assets dropped by 4%, driven primarily by tax-related outflows and the continuation, albeit at a much slower pace, of the client cash realignment activity we have experienced for a little over two years. And the overall level of realignment within Bank Sweep and Schwab One in the quarter was down about 50% versus the same quarter in 2023. Now as I mentioned earlier, we have seen strong growth in margin utilization to start the year. And to support that activity, we directed about $5 billion of client cash from the banks to the broker-dealers. That caused our level of supplemental borrowing to rise slightly in the quarter. What I want to emphasize again, that this is a good thing. We are more than happy to absorb a bit more borrowing on which we're paying just over 5% to support margin loans on which we're earning just under 8%. And finally, despite rates that increased slightly during the quarter, our capital position continued to get even stronger. With our adjusted Tier 1 leverage ratio, again, reminding you that's the one that's inclusive of AOCI and, therefore, what our binding constraint would be if we lose the AOCI opt-out, at Schwab Bank now well over 6% and just under 6% for the Company overall. Meaning, we are marching steadily towards our new operating objective for capital. Now despite the influence of typical seasonal pressure to start the year coupled with atypically bullish, very bullish, investor sentiment, client cash balances have largely trended consistent with our expectations, despite rates remaining higher than the Fed and the market predicted earlier in the year. And all indications support that we are in the very late innings of client cash realignment activity. In fact, over the course of Q2, client-driven outflows from Bank Sweep despite the seasonal tax payments, have been less than the cash flow generated from our investment portfolio, which in the absence of any other actions on our part would have led to continued decline to supplemental borrowing. Now with new client acquisition and organic growth returning to our historical norms, and all signs suggesting that the Fed funds rate has likely peaked, meaning, in the absence of this catalyst, we expect the utilization of investment cash alternatives such as purchase money funds and CDs to stabilize and then eventually decrease over time, we believe we're nearing the point where aggregate transactional cash balances should flatten and then ultimately resume growing again. Now that solid start to the year lays the foundation for what we expect will be an even stronger end of the year, propelling us into growth through 2025 and beyond. We now expect our full year revenue to range between flat to up 2% versus 2023 or roughly in the middle of the mathematical illustrations you may recall we shared back in January. And as I shared back in May at our Investor Day, we now expect our adjusted expenses to be approximately 2% higher than 2023. And as a reminder, about half that change from the previous guidance is due to unanticipated onetime items such as the FDIC surcharge and the regulatory accrual, with the remainder coming from the increase in the SEC 31 fee, which is, again, is a pass-through expense and, therefore, P&L neutral. But to use the transitional word again, that annualized view masks the progression in earnings power by the end of the year. We're expecting flattish earnings from Q2 to Q3, but assuming the Fed cuts rates in September as is widely expected, we could see our NIM reach the mid-2.20s in Q4 on its way to approaching 3% by the end of 2025, which we believe will support adjusted earnings per share in the middle of the $0.80 to $0.90 range we outlined at the beginning of the year, with our earnings power building in 2025 and beyond. Despite long-term rates moving a little bit higher during the quarter, our capital levels are climbing steadily, and we continue to expect our consolidated adjusted Tier 1 leverage ratio to approach our slightly updated operating objective of 6.75% to 7% on a consolidated basis by the end of 2024, at which point it becomes more of a live conversation regarding whether and how we want to do further capital return, our number one priority for capital is always to support business growth. Now to the extent that we have capital in excess of what is needed to do that, we have, throughout our history, taking steps to return that to stockholders. That can be through increasing our dividend, which generally rises alongside earnings. That can be by redeeming outstanding preferreds to create additional dry powder for the future, especially preferreds that might be or might become relatively expensive, and that can also be, of course, through stock buybacks, which we do opportunistically. There is one additional consideration right now, which is to the extent that we have outstanding supplemental borrowing, we may choose to utilize some of the liquidity we'd otherwise use for buybacks to reduce some of that bank-level debt. Now doing that reduces our reliance on nonbusiness-as-usual funding sources, and given the relatively higher cost of the supplemental borrowing, it's likely more accretive to earnings in the near term, while preserving the capacity, the ability to implement stock repurchases at a later date. So by doing that, we can kind of have our cake and eat it too. Now those of you who have followed the Company for a while know that we don't tend to communicate bold, long-term financial targets. Rather, we continue to talk about our long-term financial formula, a relatively simple and straightforward formula that is based on our clear and straightforward business strategy, which we articulated, as you know, is through clients' eyes. And what makes that financial formula simple and straightforward is that it's based on a set of a pretty reasonable assumptions, for Schwab at least, around organic growth, revenue growth, expense containment and capital return, assumptions that we have delivered through the cycle over multiple decades. Over the last two-plus years, that formula has admittedly been obscured to an extent by the impact of rising rates and what that has done to client transactional cash balances. But with rates seeming to plateau and client cash realignment moderating, while organic growth returns to that historical level, we're nearing the point where that simple and straightforward formula, that simple and straightforward financial story should become more clear, one that without making some big leap of faith combined strong organic growth, strong profitability and substantial capital return. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff to facilitate our Q&A. Jeff? Sure. So, thanks, Brian. So, the scenario that I outlined is based off the Fed cutting rates a single time in the rest of this year in September. In terms of deposit betas, I wouldn't necessarily assume that deposit betas are symmetrical. If you look historically, deposit betas tend to be a bit higher on the -- in the easing cycle than they are in a tightening cycle. And so, while we certainly haven't made any decisions exactly about what we'll do with deposit rates, I think that's a reasonable expectation. And we also would expect that as rates come down, the cost of any replacement supplemental funding that we have to access comes down as well. And we'd also expect that, on the margin, that rate cuts would, over time, bring about higher levels of clients' transactional cash as the incentive for them to utilize alternative solutions like purchase money funds and CDs become somewhat less. Yes. So, we can -- certainly, we can follow up with -- we have a number of assumptions on the page there, and you're welcome to follow up with the IR team in terms of some of the details. But broadly speaking, as I mentioned previously, the assumptions are as a single Fed cut in September, client cash realignment activity that continues to moderate. We expect it will flatten and then, again, ultimately resume growth. And then more of a continuation of the general -- relatively conventional assumptions on equity market depreciation, margin balance growth that goes along with that and so forth. In terms of supplemental borrowing, our priority, of course, is to pay that down as quickly as we can. But the pace at which we pay that down, it is dependent on the level of margin balance growth. And if we see -- continue to see more margin balance growth, we will, as we always do, want to make sure we support that growth. And at times, that means moving some cash out of the -- some client cash out of the bank over to the broker-dealer. But again, that is a -- we welcome the margin balance growth. It's good for clients. It means we're -- our clients are engaged, that we are supporting our active trader community, which is a very important segment for us. It's a very profitable interest-earning assets. So, we're more than happy to support that even if it means that it delays, to a certain extent, the pay-down of supplemental borrowing. It's accretive from a NIM standpoint, accretive from a net interest revenue standpoint, and so forth. So, it's why it's really, I think, I'd caution everyone not to focus on supplemental borrowing just in isolation in a vacuum, because it's influenced by other factors as well. Yes. So, thanks for the question, Steven. So, I would say, I know we've gotten this question -- we've gotten this question a fair amount. And our thinking on repositioning trade hasn't really changed. We certainly understand the benefit of that on accelerating the paydown of supplemental borrowing, accelerating the net interest margin accretion, earnings accretion that we expect to happen over time. At the same time, we're very cognizant of, and very mindful, of doing anything that would jeopardize the trust our clients place in us, especially for the sake of, moving forward, something that we expect will happen on its own. And so that's why we haven't done that. So, I would say it's not something we, by any means, rule out altogether, but it's also not something we're looking to do in the near term. Yes. Thanks, Brennan. And so as I indicated, we're talking about years, not months and quarters. And we just want to foreshadow that, over those period of years, we think that there may be approaches that are more efficient in terms of rewarding our clients as well as rewarding our stockholders than maintaining 100% of the deposits at our bank. We want deposits, as I indicated, to be sufficient to cover the loans that we intend to do for our clients, that provide quality yields, deepen relationships and we're able to do at exceptionally low credit risk, as well as having liquidity beyond that. But we all recognize that deposit flows can be very volatile depending on rate environments. And we have in place one agreement already today that provides us substantial flexibility for client deposits with exceptional economics for us without the need for capital. And we think that there are other opportunities to consider expanding that. Again, I want to emphasize, the prepared remarks I made, that this is all subject to the economics of doing so. But we do think there are meaningful opportunities to lighten some of the capital load over time, again, measured in years, not months and quarters, that will provide us additional flexibility and also let us extend FDIC insurance to higher levels for our clients. Yes. So, I mean I think I would think about that in terms of the pace of cash flows off the investment portfolio as sort of in the $10 billion to $11 billion a quarter, somewhere in that range, as the portfolio -- the size of the portfolio goes down, that it's reasonable to expect that that level of cash flow goes down as well, sort of commensurate with that. But sort of -- and that's a general rule of thumb over the next several quarters, I think, is a reasonable expectation. Yes. Thanks, Alex, for the question. So, I know there's a lot of focus on kind of month-to-month, even at times week-to-week changes in deposit flows. I think it's important to maybe set a little bit of context. So, first is deposit flows over a short period of time are influenced by net new assets, of course, the cash is brought in from new accounts, and then what clients do with that cash. And that can be rate-driven allocations that they make to purchase money funds, CDs and so forth. It can also be into engagement in the markets, equities, mutual funds and so forth. And so that can create some variability. We have seen strong engagement in the markets. And when we look at the rate-driven activity among our clients, that continues to go down. The second point of context I would make, which is that you do see variability in those flows from, frankly, from day to day or month to month. And we can see $2 billion or $3 billion of net inflows or outflows on a particular day. And so, when you just look at a month's numbers, depending on what day of the week the month ends on, it can influence the level of transactional cash that we report on that monthly basis. And I'd say June was sort of -- was comparable to May. July has started off stronger. It's still early, it's about halfway through the month, so we'll see how the month ends. But it is -- it started off definitely stronger than in terms of deposit flows than May. In terms of the long term, to your question long term, we would expect in a stable environment that client transactional cash grows with the growth in accounts and the growth in total assets. We actually recently did a study to look at clients who opened their accounts roughly 20 years ago. And what we see over time is, as those clients increase the net worth in their accounts, increase assets in their accounts, their cash balances go up and they actually stay at a relatively constant percent of the assets in the account. And so, I think as you are modeling our transactional cash over a long period of time, over years, I think it's reasonable to expect that that transactional cash grows with the growth in assets and the growth in accounts. When rates are rising, it will -- growth will be a little bit lower, and rates are falling, that growth will be a little bit faster. But I think over time in a stable environment, that's a reasonable expectation over, again, over multiple years. Yes. Thanks, Chris. So, the 3% -- approaching -- NIM approaching 3% by the end of 2025, the primary driver of that is, again, the moderation of the client transactional cash realignment activity and the paydown of the supplemental borrowing. That is very, very accretive to our net interest margin. In terms of whether the comments that Walt provided have any influence over that, I'd just reiterate what he said, which is that is something that's evolutionary, not revolutionary. It's going to play out over multiple years. And so, it doesn't influence at all really the -- that more near-term outlook that we have for the end of -- towards the end of 2025. Thanks for the question. All right. Well, I think it's my opportunity or my time to close. I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning and hearing our thoughts on the business and the opportunity in front of us. I think it's very easy to focus on very near-term practical measures. And as client cash realignment activity, plus or minus $1 billion, or supplement our borrowing or net interest margin in terms of -- which we measure in terms of basis points. And those of you who follow the Company for a long time know that we manage for the long term. We have a very long-term orientation. Our faith in our clients, our faith in our strategy, our confidence in that strategy really helps us remain focused on long term. And Walt described this year at the outset as a transitional year. And I think as we sit here halfway through the year, we feel really good about how that transition is going in terms of our strategic positioning, in terms of the completion of the Ameritrade integration and the satisfaction of those clients, in terms of the organic growth, the capital levels, and even the financial performance.

            "name": "Walt Bettinger",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our July business update. Earlier this year, we spoke about 2024 being a transition year for the firm. We define this year as transitional for a series of reasons. We were anticipating completing the last transition groups from the Ameritrade acquisition. And we anticipated that former Ameritrade clients would move from negative asset flows to positive levels of net new assets. We further anticipated that former Ameritrade retail clients would begin to utilize Schwab capabilities in the areas of investment advisory, financial planning and banking. We anticipated the investment advisers, who formerly used Ameritrade for custodial services, would also begin to bring net new assets to Schwab, and their evaluation of our service levels would improve rather dramatically. We anticipated that Schwab users of StreetSmart would begin to take advantage of the powerful trading capabilities in the Thinkorswim platforms. From a capital standpoint, we anticipated that we would organically build capital throughout the year toward our long-term objectives. And from a financial standpoint, we anticipated improving, albeit somewhat uneven, earnings results during the year with Q4 2024 delivering somewhere between $0.80 and $0.90, and then with strong growth continuing into 2025 and beyond. Halfway through the year, this definition of a transition year is being realized, again, as we anticipated. And all of these issues position us for a strong period of growth in client metrics and financial results in the coming years. So, with these critical indicators of success unfolding in such a positive manner, let's take a quick look tactically at how the second quarter of this year looked. Inflation showed some encouraging signs of moderating, closer to the Fed target of 2%, which continued pushing a select number of primarily technology stocks ever higher during the quarter. Investor sentiment remained solidly positive at quarter-end with investors purchasing stocks throughout the quarter and overall trading activity was a bit higher than in the prior year. Now as I stated earlier, as we anticipated, we completed the last client transition group during the second quarter. That's almost $2 trillion in assets, 17 million client accounts, and over 3.5 million daily average trades, all done with the attrition levels that are well below other integrations in our industry, as well as our estimates at the time of the acquisition, which were 5% to 6% asset attrition and 4% revenue attrition. And while it's still somewhat early, the client response to the combined platform has been even stronger than we anticipated. Promoter Scores for former Ameritrade retail clients are now increasing about 50 points nine months post conversion date. While the Promoter Scores for advisory services, including the former Ameritrade adviser clients, have returned to pre-conversion levels. Impressively, former Ameritrade retail clients who converted in 2023 are already bringing in assets on a net basis. However, their level of net new assets still remains below our target range. Clearly, this illustrates that we're reaching an inflection point as attrition continues to abate and we rebuild back to firm-wide net new asset levels in our targeted 5% to 7% range. And lastly, former Ameritrade retail clients are already making up about one-third of our overall enrollments in advisory solutions, an early illustration of the power of combining the two firms and their interest in Schwab's broader offering of wealth management solutions. The overall client engagement was solid in the second quarter with the equity buy-sell ratio at about 1.1, while daily average trades remained at relatively high levels for a second quarter and above the same period from last year. Meanwhile, we've seen a large increase in interest among our clients in our Managed Investing solutions. So overall, key client metrics continue to be solid. Net new assets year-to-date were over $150 billion, including Q2 asset gathering of about $60 billion, up 17% from the same period last year, again, still somewhat below our long-term goal of 5% to 7% to an economic cycle but growing closer to that figure as the impact from former Ameritrade client attrition begins to wane. New brokerage accounts were again almost $1 million -- I'm sorry, 1 million accounts during the quarter. Looking deeper at the types of clients we're attracting. These new-to-firm households continue to set us up well for the long term with almost six out of 10 new clients under the age of 40. And investment adviser clients of all sizes continue to entrust their client assets to our custodial services. For years, we've emphasized that Schwab Advisor Services is the premier offering for RIAs of all sizes, and we are equally committed to each segment of advisers. And these net new asset results are particularly encouraging as they reflect our success serving again every size adviser. Let me take a brief step back to take a more big-picture look at Schwab and the growth trajectory we've been on for over 50 years. From our origins as a discount broker, we have continually listened to client needs, as well as anticipated client needs, and added services and capabilities along the way. What is key is that we have always done so in a Schwab Way, through clients' eyes, at a great value and without the client having to accept trade-offs. We call that modern wealth management. And when we look to the future, we believe this formula will only serve to build our market share larger and larger. Of course, one of the key capabilities we have added along the way has been banking services to meet the needs of our clients on both sides of their personal balance sheets. Now some have asked us after the regional banking crisis of 2023 whether we remain committed to serving our clients' banking needs. And the answer is a definite yes. That said, we have studied our approach to offering banking services in recent quarters and wanted to share a few additional perspectives on how we see banking unfolding in the future at Schwab. Offering lending services to our retail clients and the clients of the investment advisers we serve is important. Arguably, it's critical as it meets client needs and deepens relationships in a meaningful way. Most of our significant competitors have the ability to assist clients with both their investing needs as well as their borrowing needs. We believe firms that do not offer lending services are at a strategic disadvantage that will show itself more and more over time. So, we are committed to offering quality lending services in a manner consistent with how we lend today, exclusively for our clients, residential mortgages, HELOCs for clients who have their first mortgage with us, and pledged asset lines. And to support lending for our clients, we continue to invest in both technology to make the application and approval process streamlined and efficient, as well as experienced bankers who can help shepherd the more complex loans through. From the standpoint of the investments we make at the bank for deposits in excess of those needed for lending to our clients, over time, and by that, I mean, years, not months or quarters, we would envision some shortening of our overall balance sheet investment portfolio duration. That could lead to some modestly higher earnings volatility through an interest rate cycle but should help reduce volatility of our capital levels and the need to access supplemental borrowing when interest rates potentially rise rapidly. One of our objectives is to increase our emphasis on attracting transactional bank deposits like checking balances with our award-winning checking product. This would serve as a means of increasing liquidity and further stabilizing our overall deposit base. And we envision the potential to increase our usage of third-party banks like TD Bank and others to achieve the following goals, deliver extended FDIC insurance for clients, lower our capital intensity, and improve liquidity, subject, of course, to obtaining economics from the third-party banks that make sense for us. Net, these various actions should lead, again, over time to a bank that is somewhat smaller than our bank has been in recent years, while retaining the ability to meet our clients' banking needs, lower our capital intensity and, importantly, protect the economics we are able to generate from owning a bank. So, while we see some modest changes in the way we manage and operate our bank, one thing you can count on, we will continue to operate our business in the Schwab Way, making decisions through clients' eyes, offering clients great value, and delivering service and advice to our valued clients without asking for any trade-offs. So Rick, let me turn it over to you for some more discussion on our efforts as well as results during the second quarter. Yes. So, I think it's I think it's early to have definitive answers on the first set of questions that you asked. Although if you research our IDA agreement with TD Bank, it probably gives you a good direction with respect to the economics. The economics can be very attractive for us in terms of not needing to have capital relative to those deposits. And that's where I would probably direct you to look in terms of the economics of that. In terms of the level, we want to make sure that we maintain sufficient deposits at our bank to, again, fund the loans that our clients want, and then have appropriate levels of liquidity over and above that. With respect to the Wells Fargo issue, we have provided money market fund sweep cash and -- or money market yields on bank cash for all of our fiduciary-driven investment advisory solutions already. So, I don't really see the Wells Fargo report having any kind of meaningful implications for us. We've been doing this for an extended period of time already. Let me start by saying first -- thanks for the question, Kyle. Let me start by saying when we look at our Schwab client base, we continue to grow within that 5% to 7% organic growth rate that we target over the long term. When you look at the Company level metrics, what's keeping us from the 5% to 7% overall is, in fact, behavior of the Ameritrade clients. And the great thing that we're seeing is we are seeing a change in their behavior. And it's in line with what we would expect, which is, first, we need to stop clients from leaving the firm and from Ameritrade flows being negative. And I think we're in the process of that happening. Walt referenced the significant improvement in Client Promoter Scores. That's true both on the retail side and the adviser side. So, Client Promoter Scores are getting higher. As those Client Promoter Scores are getting higher, we're moving from outflows from our Ameritrade clients to inflows. What we then need to do is to move a client base that hasn't had client flows quite in line with where Schwab organic growth rate has been historically. We need to move them from being positive contributors to net new assets to contributing at the same level as Schwab -- as our Schwab organic growth rate. And the way we'll do that is by introducing our Schwab model to Ameritrade clients, the financial consultant, the relationship model, the service, the advice, the consultants that we bring on the advisory side. All of that, we believe, will help accelerate the Ameritrade net new asset formation. So, we're confident we can grow in the 5% to 7% range. We continue to do so on the Schwab side today. And we're right where we'd expect to be in terms of the process of moving Ameritrade clients from being net detractors in net new assets to now being slightly positive. And then, we anticipate by introducing our model to them to be able to grow them to the same level as Schwab clients over time. Let me start with the Ameritrade part of the question. We brought over about $2 trillion of Ameritrade client assets. We're at $9.4 trillion overall. So, Ameritrade is clearly an important part of our business. Looking at the longer term, important to remember the enthusiasm we have for the combination of the strength of Ameritrade and Schwab. We were talking a lot about short-term dynamics around cash and net interest margin and things like that. We have an incredible franchise that we've just spent four years putting together the best of everything Ameritrade had to offer with the best of everything Schwab has to offer. And the behavior we're seeing from our clients is exactly what we would expect. We went from clients who experienced a lot of change and might have had dual relationships at Ameritrade and somewhere else, making the decision that this wasn't where they wanted to be. And so we did see some attrition. That attrition was well below what our expectations were. And now we're seeing what we'd expect to see in the next phase, which is client satisfaction from those clients that were moved, who had their experience change, improving dramatically. We're up 35 points in our advisory services business in terms of our overall client promoter scores following the conversion. And on the retail side, nine months after a client moves, their satisfaction is up 50 points. So, we have built a platform that both sets of clients love. And now what we get to do for the long term and for the foreseeable future is deliver our mission of making a difference in our clients' lives through a platform that's never been stronger on the retail side and the adviser side than it is right now today. And so, we're confident in our long-term organic growth rate. We think the behavior we're seeing is exactly in line with what we would have expected, and are very optimistic for our future growth. So, I just want to clarify, in our fiduciary relationships where we -- in our Managed Investing programs, our wealth programs, cash assets are invested in a sweep government money fund. So, we don't have this exposure that Wells Fargo has. Thanks for the question, Devin. We certainly think we can expand our lending capabilities. And the way we're focused on doing that is by creating the easiest, most straightforward, client-friendly process in the industry. We've seen that within our pledged asset line program where it's now 1.7 days average cycle time to get a pledged asset line. It's actually less than a day for individual and joint accounts, but our more complex ones drive up the average time. 85% of those originations are now done digitally. These are major enhancements. And we're making other enhancements to our mortgage process, to the way we lend to our higher net worth clients and the experience they have. So, we're trying to build an experience that makes it such that our Schwab clients never want to borrow somewhere else, they want to borrow from us. So, we do think there is lots of runway to close that gap, and we're quite bullish on our -- on the opportunity here. Now, we are in an interest rate environment where there's not as much borrowing as we've seen historically, not as much rolling over of loans and things. But we are confident that we've built the process, the experience and the offer that we should be for our clients an exceptional place to borrow. And that includes our industry-leading rates for clients that have assets with us. Final comment I'd make is it's also a terrific way to add to the service that we provide to our adviser clients. Our advisers for years have been asking us to do more lending because they don't want to have to introduce another party into the relationship. And increasingly, we're able to meet their needs, which delights them, and we think we'll be able to do more of that over time."

            "content": "Thanks, Walt, and good morning, everyone. With the successful completion of the Ameritrade conversion behind us, we are looking ahead to an exciting new chapter as we continue to advance our four strategic focus areas. And we will do so from a position of strength, having fully combined the best of Schwab and Ameritrade to offer our clients a no trade-offs experience. Our ability to increase our scale while also continuously driving efficiency in our operations remains one of our key competitive advantages. The Ameritrade integration is a clear example of how we have vastly increased our scale while cutting costs. And by the end of this year, we'll realize the remaining 10% of run rate expense synergies from the acquisition. Over time, our growing client base, our cost discipline and our ongoing investments in technology will continue to help us reduce our cost to serve our clients, in the same way it has over the past decade as we've decreased our cost per client account by 25% and by around 50% when you consider inflation. We plan to build on this competitive advantage. We will invest in technology, including artificial intelligence, that will ultimately help us lower our costs. We will implement operational enhancements and process transformation so we can serve our clients even more efficiently than we do today. And as we continue to increase our scale and enhance our efficiency, we'll reinvest in our clients over time and support our growth for the long term, just as we've done historically. Win-win monetization is about meeting more of our clients' total financial needs. By offering the ease and convenience of having more of their financial life in one place, we're also able to bolster our revenue growth and our wealth business is growing quickly. And this is a win for clients as Client Promoter Scores for our advice solutions are among the highest at the firm. So, these are our happiest clients. And it is a win for us. Year-to-date, we've attracted nearly $25 billion in Managed Investing net flows, a 56% increase over last year. And we see strong net flows across our spectrum of solutions. And you can see the growth on this page: 40% in Schwab Wealth Advisory, 53% in Wasmer Schroeder, and 127% and in Schwab Personalized Indexing. By offering our clients a broad spectrum of the wealth solutions they need, we're also supporting growth in our fee-based revenue streams, as you can see with the growth in our revenue on the right-hand side of this page. Looking within our Wealth Solutions, I wanted to do a bit of a deeper dive into our Wasmer strategies. These fixed income strategies provide clients with a wide range of tax-exempt and taxable solutions. Clients also have access to a dedicated team of portfolio managers and portfolio personalization capabilities, all at a lower cost than competitive offerings. With total assets under management of $25 billion, we've seen assets in these strategies grow at a compound annual growth rate of 23% since our acquisition in July of 2020 and have grown by nearly 80% in the last two years where we've had a higher interest rate environment. This year-to-date alone, we've seen net flows of $4 billion, demonstrating that these solutions are indeed meeting client needs. Turning now to client segmentation. At Schwab, we will always meet the needs of a wide spectrum of investors and RIA firms, but we also need to serve our distinct client segments. And strong relationships are the foundation of our ability to do this. When we build relationships by meeting client needs and meeting clients where they are and with the service models, the tailored education and the specialized capabilities they need, we will retain our existing clients and attract new ones. RIAs, which are one of our key client segments, we strengthened our relationships with RIAs of all sizes through an unparalleled offer that helps each of them grow, compete and succeed. For example, we offer advisers turnkey asset management solutions, flexible technology, and highly specialized business consultant teams, all at an incredible value with zero custody fees and no intention of changing that. Turning to our retail business, high net worth retail clients are another important segment where the power of strong relationships is clear. Our high net worth retail investors who have a financial consultant, bringing more than 3x the average household net new assets, 2.8x the Managed Investing net flows, and have better TOA ratios, and notably higher Client Promoter Scores compared to retail high net worth clients who do not have an FC. Continuing to invest so we can build and expand on these valuable client relationships will help support our growth over the long term. Our fourth strategic focus area is the Brilliant Basics. We know that we can make it even easier for our clients to do business with us, and if we can deliver on the basics for our clients in every interaction they have at Schwab, we'll build loyalty and our delighted clients will grow their wealth with us and refer their friends and family members to us. One example of how we're delivering on this for clients is the enhancements we continue to make to the best-in-class Schwab mobile app. We know clients and third parties like it today. Our mobile app has a 4.8-star rating on the App Store. And for the second year in a row, Corporate Insight has ranked us the number one mobile app experience among brokerage firms. And we continue to invest in and enhance that experience. We're introducing features our former Ameritrade clients love, like the recently launched customizable dashboard. Other recent and planned enhancements will simplify the client experience by reducing clicks and expanding on our customization capabilities. Guided by our consistent through client-size strategy, we remain well positioned for continued growth. While there are several factors that can influence asset gathering in the near term, things like the macroeconomic environment, seasonality and some behavioral differences we see in the former Ameritrade client base, we believe our through-the-cycle growth recipe remains intact. Over the longer term, we expect we'll continue to see 5% to 7% annualized NNA growth from existing and new clients, bolstered by delivering on our four strategic focus areas. As we've shared, 2024 is a transition year, with strong client engagement, a successful integration, continued progress on our strategic focus areas, and opportunities to introduce our client base to the best of Schwab and Ameritrade, we remain well positioned to continue serving our growing client base and delivering profitable long-term growth to stockholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Peter."
